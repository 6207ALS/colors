    "description": "<p>The famous series <em>Eight Views of the Parlor</em> was produced in 1766, around the time  of the emergence of full-color prints in Japan. The series contains eight prints that were housed together in a fanciful wrapper, all of which are now in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. These scenes present visual puns based on well-known themes of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers in China, each of which has its own poetic title. For <em>Evening Snow</em>, Suzuki Harunobu depicted silk floss as snow and the floss shaper as the mountain rather than showing snow-covered hills.</p>\n<p>Such witty visual riddles would have been appreciated by the audience of these prints\u2014wealthy, well-educated townsmen who participated in poetry circles. One such figure was \u014ckubo Jinshir\u014d Tadanobu, whose pseudonym was Kyosen. It is thought that he produced this set, engaging Harunobu\u2019s services as well as those of the printer. In fact, this image contains Kyosen\u2019s handwritten signature, leading scholars to believe that the Art Institute\u2019s set is the first edition. Sets with Harunobu\u2019s signature exist in other collections.</p>\n",
