Echoing those of buffalo, the framing horns fit within a visual theme that is widespread in West Africa, referencing ideas of male power, authority, and prestige. Among the Bamana and other Mande-language speakers, such helmets were called <em>sigi kun</em> (buffalo head) and used by hunters\u2019 associations.</p>\n",
