    "description": "<p><strong>In this month's Intersections program, we'll explore the relationship between image, idea, and revolution.</strong></p><p>In the Soviet revolutionary period, symbols, language, and images established, reinforced and defined the new social orders. This gallery conversation will look at images of workers and labor in the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibition/revolutsiia-demonstratsiia-soviet-art-put-test\"><em>Revoliutsiia! Demonstratsiia! Soviet Art Put to the Test</em></a> as well as images from contemporary American art and media. Together we'll explore how artists, leaders, and cultural producers perceive and define our perceptions of the oppressed, working, and under classes.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information. </p>",
