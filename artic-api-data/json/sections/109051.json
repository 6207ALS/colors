    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">A train floats across the sky at the top of this sheet, loaded with an assortment of passengers who wear hats that indicate their class, social status, or nationality (a bishop\u2019s miter, a turban with feathers, a top hat); some hold umbrellas or wear simple parachutes. Most of the faces are rendered with dots and dashes. Two passenger cars follow behind a coal car pulled by an engine that runs into the next sheet (3B). The assembly includes a few strange creatures, one with a bird head, another with horns. Such exotic touches suggest this trip is a fantastic voyage of the sort found in the novels of Jules Verne.\n\nThe train motif also alludes to the importance of the railroad to contemporary Belgian society and to the country\u2019s leading role in modern transportation. Belgian companies constructed and supplied railways around the world, and the country had a vast train network. Direct rail routes connected Ostend to other major cities in Belgium and the rest of continental Europe, as well as to the ferry to Dover, England, so that by 1870 Ostend had became a major resort. Increasing numbers of upper- and middle-class families traveled by train to visit the thermal baths, the casino, and the beaches and boardwalk, where Ensor\u2019s family ran several tourist shops.\n\nAccordingly, trains often appeared in caricatures and posters to advertise modern travel and to comment on and satirize modern experience. Posters portraying the Orient Express, run by the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits (founded in 1882 by the Belgian Georges Nagelmackers), featured views inside train cars, showing the different classes of carriage (see fig. 1). The Orient Express (as the line was dubbed in 1891) took its first trip from Paris to Vienna in October 1883. Albert Robida\u2019s caricature of a train crossing a long bridge parodies modern travel and the multiple uses of the railroad (fig. 2). Trains could also be found in political caricatures, such as an 1886 cover for the pro\u2013Roman Catholic weekly journal Le tirailleur, which depicts Progressive and Socialist politicians hopping on the Congo train, joining the Belgian king, Leopold II, in his colonial explorations (fig. 3).\n\nAt upper left a skeletal creature resembling a dinosaur (see sheet 6A) urinates from a precipice. Below appears the flattened body of a common or smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pristis or Pristis pectinata; see fig. 4); its elongated, bladelike rostrum with triangular, sawlike teeth extends into sheet 3B. The sawfish, now endangered, was once common in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea and no doubt could be regularly found at the Ostend fish market in Ensor\u2019s time. Ensor observed the fish from above, emphasizing its decorative and symmetrical form through repeated, triangle-shaped small fins and repeated overlapping ovals that suggest scales. This patterned symmetry extends to the row of teeth on either side of the sawfish\u2019s rostrum in the next sheet.\n\nIt is likely that the present sheet, sheet 3B, and sheet 4A were created in concert, as the geological form along the left side continues directly below, and the sawfish and train continue across to the sheet to the right. SMC/KJN\n\nThe action in sheets 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, and 4C is the source of the engraving Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels (fig. 5). It also indirectly inspired other etchings, such as The Terrible Archer (fig. 6), Cataclysms (fig. 7), Wizards in a Squall (fig. 8), and The Elephant\u2019s Joke (fig. 9). Although Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels is not a direct reproduction of these sheets, the chaotic composition and frightful elements are similar to Saint Anthony\u2019s torments. Many motifs appear in both the print and the drawing, for example, the hot-air balloon, train, sawfish, headless bodies, octopi, insects, elephant, and submarine.\n\nIn the drawing the chaos is somewhat contained by the use of schematic registers, but in the etching Ensor dispensed with the organizational structure and allowed the chaos to become overwhelming. Sources of inspiration for the chaos include The Fall of the Rebel Angels by Pieter Bruegel I (fig. 10); versions of the temptation after Pieter Bruegel (fig. 11), by Martin Schongauer (fig. 12), and by Jacques Callot (fig. 13); and battle scenes by the Japanese artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada (fig. 14 and fig. 15). These artists provided ideas about overlapping, clashing compositions that Ensor assimilated into his own work. He interpreted these sources to offer viewers a distilled representation that condenses the energy, imagination, anxiety, and virulence of its predecessors. Thanks to this synthesis, the image possesses its own logic and magic that captivates even as it amuses and overwhelms viewers with its detail. ST\n\nfig. 1 Artist unknown. Printed by G.
