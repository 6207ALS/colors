    "description": "<p>A photographer, filmmaker, and writer, Danny Lyon has become known for immersing himself in the lives of his subjects, whether civil rights protesters in the South or prisoners of the Texas penitentiary system. Beginning in 1963, he spent four years with the Chicago Outlaws, a renegade motorcycle club, photographing its members and their activities. He published the photographs in a 1968 book titled <em>The Bikeriders</em>, a visual and textual documentary of American motorcycle gangs; he dedicated it to Hugh Edwards, at that time curator of photography at the Art Institute, who had given him early encouragement. Combining photographs with transcribed interviews and Outlaws\u2019 monologues, the project was, as Lyon wrote, intended to \u201crecord and glorify the life of the American bikerider.\u201d Though the book only reproduced work in black and white, Lyon also shot in color, having first done so in 1964 when he photographed Colombian prostitutes.</p>\n",
