Herbert Hall established a ceramics studio at his Marblehead sanatorium in 1904 to rehabilitate \u201cnervously worn out patients.\u201d Hall hired professional ceramist Arthur Baggs to assist with production, and by 1908, Marblehead had begun to focus on pottery with incised geometric designs in contrasting matte colors. Here the Japanese-informed teachings of Arthur Wesley Dow, who led a summer art colony at Ipswich, 18 miles from Marblehead, inspired the vase\u2019s stylized marsh landscape.</p>\n",
