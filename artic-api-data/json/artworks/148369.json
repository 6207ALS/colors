    "description": "<p>One of India\u2019s most popular gods, Ganesha is the son of the god Shiva and goddess Parvati. According to one story of his birth, his mother used flakes scraped from her own skin to create him to serve as a guardian. When Shiva returned and found a stranger barring his way, he flew into a rage and unwittingly decapitated his son. Upon realizing his error, he sent his attendants to fetch the head of the first creature they encountered. They returned with an elephant\u2019s head that Shiva used to bring Ganesha back to life.</p>\n",
