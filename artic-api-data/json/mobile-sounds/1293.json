    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Imagine this magnificent silver tureen set on a dining table in a splendid Paris mansion or chateau in the French countryside. It\u2019s curved surfaces gleaming in the candlelight. It would have been part of a splendid display of tableware including candelabra, lavish serving platters and perhaps tiered stands displaying fruits and sweet meets and exquisitely hand painted porcelain dishes. The tureen is a masterpiece of the silversmith\u2019s art. Look at the babies that hold up its handles on either side. They are wonderfully realized with naturalistic ringlets and curls in their hair and dimpled chubby cheeks and arms. Notice also the tureen stand whose fluted contours reflect light back on to the silver above. The tureen was made in the workshop of Fran\u00e7ois-Thomas Germain, one of the most celebrated silversmiths in France in the mid-eighteenth century. Germain\u2019s patrons included the kings of France and Portugal as well as wealthy aristocrats throughout Europe.</p>\n",
