Led by artist Leslie Baum, participants will freshly interpret landscape paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection by applying Hockney\u2019s bold use of color and pattern. The digital will inspire the analog as participants use color pencils to emulate Hockney\u2019s layered iPad drawings.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-21fbd4f8-7fff-cdf1-9778-dca9657de5a0\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br><br></span>Participants are encouraged to visit the David Hockney exhibition on their own before the program. Please note this Saturday Studio does not take place inside the exhibition space.</p><p><strong>Leslie Baum</strong> is a Chicago-based painter whose work is invitational in nature. Her painting practice is informed by over 20 years as a museum educator at the Art Institute of Chicago.

She has exhibited nationally and internationally with exhibitions in New York, San Francisco, Portland, Mexico City, Rome, and South Korea.
