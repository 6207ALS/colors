    "description": "<p>Artist Ilit Azoulay (Israeli, born 1972) is best known for mural-sized photomontages that depict arrangements of found architectural objects and fragments in Tel Aviv and, more recently, in other locations. Her elaborately constructed photographs of places and objects seemingly charged with history remind us, in her words, that \u201cevery act of remembrance reflects back on the act of forgetting.\u201d<br><br>Azoulay\u2019s work has been exhibited extensively internationally including solo exhibitions at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem (2017), Kunst Werke, Berlin (2014), and the Herzeliya Museum of Contemporary Art (2014). Her works are in numerous museum and private collections including The Museum of Modern Art in New York and Centre Pompidou Paris. She lives and works in Berlin.</p>",
