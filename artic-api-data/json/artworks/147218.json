A videotape of King\u2019s beating had been extensively televised. The not guilty verdicts became a catalyst for widespread civil unrest.\n\nRiots began with several mob assaults at this intersection. Reginald Denny, a white truck driver, was pulled from his truck and severely beaten as a camera crew broadcast the event live from a news helicopter. \n\nThe Los Angeles Riots caused more than fifty deaths and an estimated one billion dollars worth of damage.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
