    "description": "<p>This bowl contains yellow threads wound around colorless canes of glass that were then fused together. The spiral pattern in the body of bowls of this kind has given them the name network mosaic bowls. Most known examples were recovered in 1900 from a shipwreck that probably occurred around 80 B.C. off the southwest coast of Greece near Antikythera. The discovery of similar examples in Syria, Crete, Greece, and southern Italy has led to the theory that these distinctive bowls were made in the eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n",
