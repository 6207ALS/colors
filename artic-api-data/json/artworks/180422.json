    "description": "<p>The <em>dodot</em> is an oversized hip wrapper worn by the sultan and members of his family and the court on special ceremonial occasions. As in headcloths and breast cloths, the central diamond may be unadorned. Here, in a pattern called <em>alas-alasan</em> (like a forest), a complex pattern of animals, birds, insects, and sea creatures is combined with plant forms to represent the totality of the Javanese universe. Motifs are worked in gold leaf on the deep blue-black ground around the diamond. The annual commemoration of the ruler's ascendance to the throne is celebrated by court dancers wearing <em>dodots</em> and breast cloths of this particular style.<br>Batik Textiles of Java, April 21-September 17, 2017</p>\n",
