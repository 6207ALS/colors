    "description": "<p>An important investigation of the complicated relationship between canonical African art and the practices of contemporary African artists</p>\n<p>Recognizing the second lives of historical African artworks when they enter museum collections and addressing them in dialogue with the works of six established and emerging African artists, this book represents how today\u2019s practitioners are reformulating the continent\u2019s artistic traditions to respond to the contemporary landscape. Historically, African art objects such as masks and sculptures were composed of a matrix of materials that included medicine bundles, raffia assemblage, hides, and metal, some or all of which were repurposed: a \u201csecond career\u201d for the materials. This practice of transforming materials has wider cultural resonance in Africa today, where electronics, discarded engines, and rubber tires are incorporated by artisans into domestic and personal items. The contemporary African artists featured here\u2014El Anatsui (Ghana), Nnenna Okore (Nigeria), Zohra Opoku (Ghana), Elias Sime (Ethiopia), Tahir Carl Karmali (Kenya), and Gon\u00e7alo Mabunda (Mozambique)\u2014reflect these dual traditions, reviving conceptual elements of historical African art by creating work that responds to the evolution of Africa\u2019s artistic traditions.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 x 12 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 128</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 90 color + b-w</li>\n</ul>",
