    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The great Dutch artist Rembrandt made this painting in about 1631. Martha Wolff, Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European Painting before 1750.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: This is a sort of fantasy portrait. It is of a sitter who appears in many early pictures by Rembrandt. He seems to have been a man with picturesque features, who Rembrandt could recast in different characters. And so he dresses him up in a big velvet beret that is really the costume of about a hundred years earlier, and a plumed feather in the beret, and a steel gorget, a little neck protector, to evoke a military hero. It's a character study and a grand statement of what Rembrandt can do, at the point when he is leaving his birthplace in Leiden and going to set himself up in Amsterdam, in the metropolis.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: There, Rembrandt would establish himself as one of the preeminent artists of his period. Notice how dramatic light and shadow define the man's face.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: Also typical of him in this early period, is the very fine, delicate stippling and modeling of the face in the light, with little small strokes and fine painting style. So he's using the light and this rather miniaturist technique at this point, to create almost a map of the face.</p>\n",
