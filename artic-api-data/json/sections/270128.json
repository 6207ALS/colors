Attracted to the unpretentious little store on Milman\u2019s Row, with its picturesque old clothes and baskets of rags, he drew the same shopfront at least twice in other media. A small etching (K 272) and a pen-and-ink drawing (fig. 26a [M 1586]) of the shop also seem to date from the late 1880s; although they cannot be dated with absolute certainty, there is little stylistic difference between the images that cannot be attributed to Whistler\u2019s sensitivity to the particular characteristics of the different media, and it is likely that in fact all three images were produced at about the same time.\n\nChelsea Rags is the most elaborate image Whistler had attempted on transfer paper to date. The drawing was executed on a transfer paper with an obtrusive mechanical pattern. The use of a variety of soft crayons seems to have made it possible for the artist to achieve greater tonal variation than in earlier images drawn on similar coarse grades of transfer paper. It was transferred and proved with four other subjects (cat. 23, cat. 24, cat. 25, and cat. 27) on 8 June 1888 (app. II.3 and app. II.4).\n\nWhen a new monthly journal, The Albemarle, was being planned, its editors decided to include a lithograph in each issue. Whistler was the first artist invited to submit an image. In a letter to the artist dated 7 December 1891, T. R. Way indicated that Drury Lane Rags (cat. 25) was originally selected for the periodical (letter 22). However, Way may simply have mistaken the title, and ultimately it was Chelsea Rags that graced the inaugural issue, identified on its cover sheet simply as \u201cA \u2018Song on Stone\u2019 by J. McNeill Whistler.\u201d\n\nThe February issue informed readers that extra impressions of the lithograph had been printed and could \u201cbe obtained, price 6d, upon application to the Editors.\u201d In May the journal carried a more elaborate description: \u201cMounted proofs of Mr. Whistler\u2019s \u2018Song on Stone,\u2019 printed on India paper, may be obtained, price half-a-guinea each.\u201d There must have been virtually no demand for these proofs, since mounted impressions are extremely rare.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid paper (310 \u00d7 238 mm), signed; MWC, tan laid paper (311 \u00d7 227 mm). Glasgow: HAG (4), cream laid paper (311 \u00d7 198 mm), signed; cream laid paper (368 \u00d7 240 mm); grayish ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; tan laid paper (317 \u00d7 229 mm). London: BM, grayish white chine (226 \u00d7 180 mm) mounted on white plate paper (358 \u00d7 263 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (318 \u00d7 203 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (308 \u00d7 206 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Brooklyn, TBM; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.\n\nPublished edition. The published edition of this subject was machine printed on a smooth ivory wove paper, which has often discolored to cream, by Thomas Way from a supplementary stone or stones in order to protect Whistler\u2019s original stone from wear. The retransferring process resulted in some losses in the lightest lines, and a slight appearance of spottiness is evident when periodical prints are compared to lifetime impressions pulled from the original matrix. Many impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (235 \u00d7 179 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3), ivory wove paper (242 \u00d7 181 mm), with legend; ivory wove paper (240 \u00d7 179 mm), with legend; ivory wove paper (235 \u00d7 176 mm), with legend.

Washington: FGA (library), cream wove paper (236 \u00d7 171 mm), with legend, bound; LC, cream wove paper (235 \u00d7 179 mm).\n\nRemarks: Periodical impressions are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, BPL and MFA (2); Cambridge, Mass., FAM; and New York, NYPL.  \nNesta R.

Rosalind Birnie Philip used the title The Rag Shop, Milman\u2019s Row, Chelsea; GUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 38.\n\nFor the dating of this and two slightly earlier related etchings of the same facade (K 257, K 258); see Lochnan (1984), p. 282. For the drawing, see Margaret MacDonald in Betsy G. Fryberger, Whistler: Themes and Variations (Stanford, 1978), p. 52, no. 47; and MacDonald (1995), p. 569, no. 1586.\n\nWhistler\u2019s lithograph was clearly considered one of the most noteworthy aspects of the first issue. The next issue of [glossary:The Albemarle] (February 1892) published a number of reactions to the new journal under the heading \u201cSome Opinions of the Press.\u201d One writer commented that \u201ca lithograph by Whistler is not an everyday feature of a periodical, and one is attracted alike by its cleverness and its oddities\u201d; another remarked that \u201cthe \u2018Song on Stone\u2019 by J. McNeill Whistler, might well have the legend affixed \u2018Puzzle: find the song\u2019.\u201d\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 26, only state.
