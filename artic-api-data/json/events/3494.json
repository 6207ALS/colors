The program starts at the site of his installation <em>Unslumbrous Night</em>, and then moves into the Nichols Trustee Suite.</p><p><strong>About the Artist<br></strong></p><p><strong>Andrew Lord </strong>(British, born 1950) has used traditional ceramic forms and techniques that reference 19th- and 20th-century painting and sculpture. During the last ten years the figure has become increasingly central to his work. He studied at Central School of Art and Design, London before working with ceramics in the Netherlands, at first in a factory in Delft building large municipal sculptures, and later in Amsterdam where he worked with Gallery Art and Project. In 1974 he traveled throughout Mexico on a British Council Scholarship, and moved to New York in the early 1980s. This body of work was made in rural New Mexico.</p><p>Lord straddles the boundaries of fine art and craft, abandoning the functionality and practicality of his objects in favor of conceptual pursuits. Through serial display and repetitive investigations of form, Lord transforms everyday objects into extraordinary expressions of light and shadow, volume and plasticity, surface and shape.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
