    "transcript": "<p>Paul Cezanne painted this portrait of his wife, titled Madame Cezanne in a Yellow Chair, between 1888 and 1890. The medium is oil on canvas. It measures about 2 1/2 feet high by 2 feet wide.</p>\n<p>Cezanne painted 29 portraits of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, over the course of his life. In this one, she wears a red dress and sits in a yellow chair in front of a wainscoted wall. The top half of the wall is slate blue, while the bottom half appears to be paneled with white wood. The halves are divided by a black horizontal band. The edges of the mustard yellow chair are decorated with curlicue shapes rendered with thick paint strokes. Madame Cezanne is wearing a rusty red-colored, loose-fitting dressing gown worn wrapped around the body. The dress has a high neckline and a cinched waist tied with a bow. Cezanne applied the red paint of the dress more thinly below the waist, and patches of canvas are visible through the rough brush strokes.</p>\n<p>Madame Cezanne sits angled to the right with her hands clasped in her lap. She has light skin, her brown hair is pulled back, and the cheek visible to us has a ruddy color. Hints of the same yellow used to paint the chair are visible in the front of her hair. She gazes off to her left with a serious expression and her mouth set firm. She could be unhappy, pensive, or merely bored. Although Madame Cezanne didn\u2019t sit for this painting, she did sit for the one Cezanne based it on. Imagine sitting for a portrait by Cezanne, who sometimes required 100 sittings for just 1 portrait: you might be bored too.</p>\n",
