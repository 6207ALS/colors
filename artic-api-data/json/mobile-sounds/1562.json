    "transcript": "<p>&quot;&lt;audio clip begins&gt;<br>Narrator:  Over the little doorway in the center of this Renaissance sculpture is a carved chalice with a circle above it. These represent the wafer and wine that in Catholic doctrine become the body and blood of Christ during the celebration of Mass. This piece of sculpture was a tabernacle intended to hold consecrated wine and wafers that were not used during a Mass. The tabernacle was made around 1460 by a sculptor named Isaia da Pisa for an important church in Rome. Isaia da Pisa surrounded the tabernacle doorway with an array of beautifully carved angels who guard and venerate the sacred objects within it. Notice how the central angels are carved in low relief while the two at either end are almost sculpted in the round, echoing and enhancing the gentle concave curve of the tabernacles overall form. The outer angels' intricately folded drapery and many feathered wings are especially finely carved.<br>&lt;audio clip ends&gt;&quot;</p>\n",
