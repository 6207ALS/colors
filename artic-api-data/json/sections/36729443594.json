He confided to Rodin that he anticipated that he would \u201cdo astounding things\u201d there. He had recently been to the area for the first time, accompanying his journalist friend and future biographer Gustave Geffroy on a trip to visit the poet Maurice Rollinat at his home. Geffroy had known the poet for years and had written a long and favorable review of Rollinat\u2019s Les n\u00e9vroses: Les \u00e2mes, les luxures, les refuges, les spectres, les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres when it was published. The group also included Louis Mullem, editor of La justice, and the architect Frantz Jourdain. The reclusive Rollinat and his wife lived on the outskirts of the small hilltop village of Fresselines overlooking the confluence of the Petite Creuse and Grande Creuse rivers. Overwhelmed by the beauty of the region\u2019s unspoiled terrain, Monet returned home after the weeklong excursion and immediately began preparing to return for a painting trip. Monet arrived in the region on March 7; the campaign lasted three months, much longer than Monet had estimated.\n\nStaying at a local inn, Monet often dined with Rollinat, whose melancholy nature and mood swings may have resonated with his own. During this trip the artist endured colds, cramps, chapped hands that required gelatin-lined gloves, and lumbago, while also suffering from enormous anxiety and fatigue. On May 14, a few days before leaving Fresselines to return to Giverny, he confided to his companion, Alice Hosched\u00e9, \u201cYou will never know what I have suffered during this campaign. . . . I am at the end of my tether.\u201d The result of his twelve weeks of struggle with the landscape, weather conditions, and health issues was a trove of twenty-four canvases.\n\nThe art historian Paul Tucker was the first to fully recognize the significance of the Creuse campaign within the context of Monet\u2019s career. In his groundbreaking exhibition and catalogue Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, Tucker identified the Creuse River works as the artist\u2019s first self-consciously ambitious, rigorously intense, and planned\u2014rather than empirically determined\u2014group of paintings to date. These river scenes also mark the artist\u2019s first consistent attempt to control the environment, a strategy he would employ in the later series of stacks of wheat, poplar trees, mornings on the Seine, and the water lily pond at his home in Giverny.\n\nWritten while the artist worked intermittently from the end of winter through spring, Monet\u2019s letters to Alice track the development of the motifs he had selected for these works, \u201cmorning and afternoon, sun and grey weather.\u201d To what extent the artist may have reworked the canvases to ensure that they represented the meteorological conditions in which they were first conceived is unknown, but already within a few weeks of his return to Giverny, at least fourteen canvases were sufficiently finished to be included in the Monet-Rodin exhibition that year.\n\nThe only vertical composition in this series, Valley of the Creuse at Fresselines (fig. 25.2 [W1218]), provides a road map for Monet\u2019s selection and framing of the Creuse paintings. Unlike other canvases in the series, which focus on narrow views of locations along the river (e.g., fig. 25.3 [W1219]), Valley of the Creuse offers a broad view of the two rivers as they converge into one. The Petite Creuse moves from the lower right diagonally across the canvas to meet the Grande Creuse, which enters the picture from center left. The conjoined river (at center) then cuts right, left, and then again right, winding off through the hills in the distance.\n\nAfter setting out the topographical details of this breathtaking and dramatic canyon-like ravine, with the rivers referred to as les eaux semblantes (\u201ctwinned rivers\u201d), Monet moved to the far side of the hill seen at the bottom left of Valley of the Creuse at Fresselines and turned his easel toward the bulbous hill formation across the river, which extends out from the center left edge of the composition. A contemporary photograph of this same view shows how precisely Monet respected the general perspective and the relationship of the hulking form to the river cutting into it (fig. 25.4). The paintings in the series, ranging from the large (e.g., The Creuse, Dark Weather [1889; Von der Heydt-Museum, Wuppertal (W1224)]) and the sunny (e.g., fig. 25.3) to the smaller sunset composition in the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet (fig. 25.5 [W1225]), make up a significant portion of the output of the Creuse campaign (ten of the twenty-four) and were undoubtedly among the fourteen paintings that Monet claims were in progress after less than a fortnight, before the weather turned \u201csinister.\u201d Trapped indoors at the village inn at Fresselines, some three kilometers away from his chosen motif, he worried that the paintings would be too lugubrious and that he might have to start over when good weather returned.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s painting and two closely related canvases (fig. 25.6 [W1230] and fig. 25.7 [W1232]) all show the Petite Creuse before it merges with the Grande Creuse. For this trio, Monet moved slightly upstream, repositioning himself so he could take in the hills sloping steeply in from the left with a solitary oak tree on the other side of the river. The fuller, rounded trees, visible from a higher vantage point on the far left in the vertical composition (fig. 25.2), can be seen to the right of the scraggly oak (fig. 25.8) in the Petite Creuse paintings.\n\nInstead of monumental mounds silhouetted against the sky, triangles of cascading strips of color suggest the rocky slopes. These \u201crivulets of contrasting color\u201d indicate, in the lower right of the composition, the point at which the river bends and flows toward the confluence. Similar to the hill paintings of the Creuse Valley, each of the Petite Creuse trio shows the effects of sunlight and shadows hitting the face of a hill or cliff, seen particularly in the indentations of the natural crevices with their purple hollows.\n\nFor the Art Institute\u2019s version of the Petite Creuse, Monet made only a few adjustments. Following his usual working method, he laid in the basic composition thinly and then built up the forms with individual strokes of paint applied in different lengths and directions (fig. 25.9). The brushstrokes were often applied wet-in-wet, which suggests that he painted quickly; in some cases a single stroke included multiple colors (e.g., fig. 25.10), indicating little or no mixing on the palette (see Technical Report). In a related sketchbook drawing (fig. 25.11 [D361]), Monet seems to have conceived the Petite Creuse canvases as compositions based on large triangular forms. In the paintings, the ridges are color coded according to the time of day, with the Art Institute\u2019s palette being closest to Valley of the Creuse (Sunlight Effect) (fig. 25.3). In both, dark pinks and purples were used for the nearest hill; neon greens, yellows, and lavenders for the middle and sunlit hill; and a medley of blues, turquoises, and pinks for farthest. In the Art Institute\u2019s painting, counterbalancing the long horizontal strokes used to suggest the cascading crevices of this rugged terrain are the flicks of color applied in smaller touches to suggest rippling waters (see Technical Report). Swirls of neon green seen in the tree shaped like a dinosaur and in its larger, fuller neighbor on the landmass at middle right echo patches of a similar green seen on the opposite hillside (fig. 25.12). Monet added as finishing flourishes intensely colored strokes, rendered with an extremely light touch, which skip across the canvas and enliven the surface (fig. 25.13). The result has a woven, skein-like quality with an extraordinarily high-hued palette. Even when compared to the \u201cterrible savagery\u201d of the Belle-\u00cele paintings (1886; see cat. 24)\u2014a preceding campaign with difficult terrain and unpredictable weather that Monet likened to the conditions he experienced while in the Creuse\u2014the brushwork and palette that resulted in the vibrating surfaces seen in these Petite Creuse paintings were a new development.\n\nIt is likely that Monet began the three Petite Creuse canvases before April 13, when he was forced to suspend work for three weeks because of a combination of health-related issues and bad weather. By the time Monet returned to the location in early May, springtime had arrived, and he found the landscape radically changed. The spring thaw had caused the river to rise, and the sun reflecting off the drop of the river was blindingly bright. Some trees had been cut down and some had sprouted leaves, including the oak tree just right of center in the Petite Creuse trio. Monet had laid in both this tree and its fuller companions, along with the tree at the top of the hill, early on (fig. 25.14). For Monet the oak tree, marking a bend in the Petite Creuse, played the \u201clead role\u201d compositionally in the three Petite Creuse paintings.\n\nThe gnarled oak tree was essential to Monet\u2019s emotional and aesthetic attachment to this site: not only did it impart a rhythm and pattern to the surface, it conveyed a mood. So important was the tree\u2019s nature as he first encountered it to his concept that he determined to undo nature itself. Instead of accepting the seasons\u2019 effects and reworking or even restarting the canvas accordingly, Monet intervened to reverse them. Hiring workers to scale ladders to defoliate the tree, Monet re-created its winter appearance.\n\nIn addition to modifying the actual oak tree, Monet made a few changes to his painted composition: giving a little more volume to the tree at right, adding a dip in the horizon line at far left (fig. 25.15), and raising the water level at the point where it meets the hill in the left foreground, which at one time extended farther into the Petite Creuse (fig. 25.15 and fig. 25.16). These compositional adjustments, along with the additional strokes of intense color added lightly to the surface (perhaps at the same time he added his signature and some additional brushstrokes, see Technical Report), suggest work done away from the motif and probably after his return to Giverny, where he edited and harmonized, rather than radically or substantially reworked the series.\n\nApart from the physical strain Monet experienced while working in Fresselines, he was stricken by anxieties about his upcoming exhibition at Galerie Georges Petit, the opening of which was scheduled for June to coincide with the massive Exposition Universelle. For the first time in his career, Monet\u2019s work was generously on display, and from his own choosing. He shared the show with Auguste Rodin, whose public commissions in the 1880s (notably Les bourgeois de Calais) had guaranteed the sculptor official and financial success at a time when Monet was still struggling. The Creuse canvases were created on the eve of this breakthrough exhibition, which consisted of 145 paintings by Monet paired with 36 sculptures by Rodin. The exhibition was neither chronological nor thematic; it included canvases from Monet\u2019s painting trips at Belle-\u00cele and Antibes from the 1880s, and fourteen Creuse paintings never previously on view and shown together for the first time as a self-contained set. These can be seen as a response to the myths springing up about him\u2014as the artist of la France profonde, authentic France, and as the \u201cmethodical\u201d artist who approached the landscape in a \u201cmathematical\u201d manner, a method as progressive as the science of his own times.\n\nThe exhibition, a critical as well as commercial success for Monet, introduced him to an international audience and, in particular, to American collectors. Critics were effusive in their praise for both artists, recognizing the historic moment of two lions of the vanguard together in one exhibition. Monet\u2019s landscapes were especially praised in general for their truthful evocation of specific times of day and changing atmospheric conditions: \u201cNo painter, in these times, has known, better than M. Monet, how to express the infinite variety of things, to represent their changing aspects, with their mobility, their form and their color, at the hour in which they appeared, [and] in their atmosphere and light.\u201d\n\nMonet seems to have attached particular importance to the recently completed Creuse canvases. He hung the fourteen together as a group\u2014this was the first time that he employed this strategy, one that he would go on to use throughout the 1890s and that indicates how much he valued them. Monet\u2019s high regard for the series was reciprocated by critics like Paul Focher, despite their more challenging subject matter. Focher admired the \u201cuncomparable majesty\u201d and Octave Maus, leader of the Brussel-based avant-garde exhibition Les XX, esteemed the \u201cextraordinary mastery\u201d of the Creuse group.\n\nIn the Creuse Valley, factors ranging from ill heath to variable and severe weather conspired against Monet. Even though he talked about moving on to the valley of Crozant, a more popular spot for artists that was famous for picturesque ruins (fig. 25.17), Monet remained a prisoner to the Creuse Valley. Consequently after the \u201csuffering\u201d he had experienced while working there, and perhaps as a response to it, Monet turned his attention to subjects in close proximity to his home at Giverny, where he would be able to assert more control and pursue his aims more efficiently. Describing the lasting impact of the Creuse series, Tucker writes, \u201cthe Creuse pictures speak about certain fundamentals of art and nature in even stronger language than any previous group of paintings, fundamentals that once again would be critical to Monet\u2019s series paintings of the next decade.\u201d  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s The Petite Creuse River was executed on a pre-primed, no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size linen canvas. There is a stamp from the color merchant Troisgros Fr\u00e8res on the back of the original canvas. There is a single, off-white ground layer. A warp-thread match was detected with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection: Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37, [W1628], inv. 1933.441) suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The artist built up the composition from an initial lay-in that included both thin toning layers and long, impasted, lead white\u2013rich strokes, which were used to block in the basic features of the landscape. The composition was worked up as a whole, using individual strokes and touches of color, which were often applied wet-on-wet but with little mixing or blending of brushwork on the canvas. A few minor adjustments were made along the edges of some of the main compositional elements, indicating slight modifications to stretches of the riverbank and the contours of some of the hills.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 25.18).\n\nSigned: Claude Monet (lower left, in orange-red paint) (fig. 25.19). The signature was applied when some of the underlying paint was still wet (fig. 25.20). A final stroke of green paint from the hill passes over the bottom of the t at the end of the signature (fig. 25.21). This suggests that some final strokes were added to the painting both before and after it was signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 92.5 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas (65 \u00d7 92 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.3V (0.6) \u00d7 22.4H (0.8) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with seven other Monet paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection: Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37 [W1628], inv. 1933.441).\n\nThere is regular, fairly even cusping on all four edges; it is slightly more pronounced on the left and right sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1965 treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced approximately 8 cm apart. There is a series of small pinholes, spaced roughly 9\u201312 cm apart. Some are on the current foldover, but this likely would have been part of the original tacking margin. Their origin and purpose are unknown.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes, spaced approximately 5\u20138 cm apart, correspond to the cusping pattern.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded/not documented. Depth: Based on a second crease in the tacking margins, where it looks like excess canvas was folded over the back face of the original stretcher, the original stretcher depth was approximately 1.5 cm.\n\nThere is a supplier\u2019s stamp on the back of the original canvas, which was photographed before the painting was lined in 1965 (see Conservation History):\n\nCOULEURS FINES / PANNEAUX / TOILES / TROISGROS Fr\u00e8res / PARIS / 35, RUE DE LAVAL / 105 RUE CARDINET (fig. 25.22). The transmitted-infrared image shows that the stamp is located on the midright side of the back of the painting (fig. 25.23).\n\nIn UV light, evidence of a light-blue fluorescence between the canvas and the ground suggests the presence of an organic layer, possibly glue sizing (fig. 25.24).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground consists of a single layer that ranges in thickness from approximately 10 to 90 \u00b5m, with the layer thicker in the interstices of the canvas weave and much thinner on the tops of the canvas threads in the samples analyzed (fig. 25.25).\n\nThe ground is off-white (fig. 25.26). Microscopically, a few dark and possibly red particles were observed.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of bone black, iron oxide, alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe main parts of the composition were worked up simultaneously, with only minor adjustments made along the borders in some places. The artist moved freely between the background and foreground, building up the composition as a whole. The initial lay-in involved the use of both thin toning layers and a few long, impasted strokes. Some time passed between this stage and the building up of the painting since the thick ridges of the underlying strokes were dry when subsequent paint was applied on top, contributing to the final surface texture of the painting (fig. 25.27). The painting was built up using individual touches of color, often applied wet-on-wet (fig. 25.28). Sometimes, multiple colors were picked up on the brush and laid down in a single stroke (fig. 25.29). The sky is the only area of the painting where there is some blending of the brushwork (fig. 25.30).\n\nThe hills were laid in using very thin applications of relatively dark color, which served as a general toning layer. The brushwork of these initial layers is not continuous, and it varies in hue from reddish-purple to brown (fig. 25.31), although the distant hill consists of fairly continuous brushwork, which makes it difficult to see the earlier paint layers. The highlighted areas of the hills were created using lead white\u2013rich paint mixtures (pale pink, yellow, and green) lightly dragged across the surface in a network of strokes, which were often pulled through the wet blue and green paint underneath (fig. 25.32). The lighter areas of the sky and the water, on the other hand, are due to either a light-colored underpainting or areas of exposed ground layer. The sky, for example, was laid in with an underlayer off-white to pale blue in color (fig. 25.33, fig. 25.34), which remains visible in places through breaks in the brushstrokes applied on top. The water was worked up, in a network of strokes, directly over the off-white ground layer (fig. 25.35): initially long, impasted, lead white\u2013rich strokes were laid down horizontally. These were then broken up by the short strokes and touches of more intense blue, green, and yellow paint applied on top. When the painting is viewed in transmitted light, one can see that the far side of the river is less thickly built up and that many of the light-colored areas are actually exposed ground, whereas, on the near side, the highlights are thick dashes of white or light-colored paint applied to the surface (fig. 25.36). Both the tree on the top of the hill and the one at the edge of the landmass at right were laid in early on, based on the wet-in-wet application of the earlier strokes of the trees with the adjacent areas of sky and landscape, respectively. The foliage was then built up once the areas behind were well established. Some of the final touches to the painting included the intensely colored, curving strokes applied with such a light touch that they skip across the recesses of the paint texture. This can be seen in the reddish-brown strokes at the base of the right-hand tree (fig. 25.37) and in the deep green and blue strokes used to enliven the shadowed area of the distant hill (fig. 25.38).\n\nA few small modifications were made to the edges of some of the forms in the painting stage. Some underlying, diagonal brushstrokes at the edge of the foreground hill at left indicate that its slope was originally more continuous; that is, without the dip that occurs near the bottom and that was created by extending the water further left in that area (fig. 25.39). The rocks at the bottom of the hill seem to have extended further right into the water when this area was initially laid in. This is evidenced by the dark brownish and purplish underpainting that is visible in the water in an area that follows the contour of the rocks (fig. 25.40, fig. 25.41). Strong horizontal strokes along the distant shoreline, seen in the X-ray (fig. 25.42), suggest that the shoreline was originally placed slightly higher. Similarly, the boundary between the river and the landmass at right may also have been slightly modified. Comparison of the X-ray with the surface image suggests that the river may have originally been broader in that area (fig. 25.43). At the extreme right, it looks like the hilltop was initially painted in with a more gradual slope at the right edge. Paint from the sky was then added over the edge of the hill, creating a slightly steeper incline (fig. 25.44). Foliage on the left side of the trees at the right edge was extended further to the left, on top of the already painted hills (fig. 25.45).\n\nA long, narrow impression, made when something was pressed against the paint while it was still wet, is visible near the top edge (fig. 25.46). This mark could be from an easel cleat or a case used for transporting the painting. It looks like some final, slightly more intense blue strokes were applied over this area of disturbed paint when it was already dry (fig. 25.47). Flattened areas of paint around the edges suggest that the work was framed when the paint was still soft (fig. 25.48).\n\nBrushes, including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and a possible trace of bone black.<sup>,</sup> UV fluorescence of pink and red strokes suggests the use of red lake throughout the landscape and in the signature. A paint sample from the dark, shadowed area of the rock, near the center of the bottom edge, shows the complex mixture of pigments that Monet used in this area (fig. 25.49).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished. The synthetic resin, applied in 1965, was removed in 2011. The painting was previously varnished in 1922 (see Conservation History).\n\nAn undated memo in the conservation file indicates that the painting was cleaned and varnished in 1922.\n\nIn 1965, the painting was cleaned, including removal of a \u201csoft resin\u201d varnish. The canvas was wax-resin lined and stretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A spray coat of (PVA) polyvinyl acetate AYAA was applied, followed by a final spray coat of methacrylate resin L-46.\n\nIn 2011, the layers of synthetic varnish applied in 1965 and residues of natural-resin varnish from earlier treatment were removed and the painting was left unvarnished.\n\nOverall, the painting is in very good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. There are two splits in the canvas (approximately 5 cm long) at the upper left foldover edge, and a tiny hole at the right side of the bottom edge. These areas are secure. There is minor abrasion to the ground and paint layers at the foldovers and in the frame rebate area. The paint layer is secure with only a couple of tiny losses near the edges. There is some slightly flattened and crushed impasto in a few places, probably the result of the lining procedure. There is some light cracking in areas of impasto and in the lead white-rich layers of the sky at upper right. A few small, localized areas of drying cracks are visible in the dark paint at lower left and lower right and associated with yellow-containing paint mixtures in the center foreground. Topped-off protrusions observed occasionally in the paint layer could be related to the presence of metal soaps (fig. 25.50). Starch-paste residues from the facing adhesive used in the lining procedure are visible over the surface, especially in the more textured areas of paint. Gold accretions from the frame are visible intermittently around the edges. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame, with carved leaf-tip back, plain face, and inner ribbon molding with ogee sight (Paul Mitchell Ltd., London, 1995). The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso. The gilding is burnished throughout and toned with oil paint wash and glue size. The carved jelutong moldings are mitered and nailed.

On other trips (such as at \u00c9tretat, Belle-\u00cele, and most recently, Antibes), Monet usually had been alone at night, and he was unused to being an audience, but at Fresselines he spent many evenings listening to Rollinat\u2019s poetry recitations and songs. Monet described Rollinat in a letter to Alice Hosched\u00e9, dated March 21, [1889]: \u201cWhat a veritable artist: he is at times certainly the most discouraging there is, full of bitterness and sadness precisely because he is an artist and therefore never content and always unhappy\u201d; translated in Steven Z. Levine, Monet, Narcissus, and Self-Reflection: The Modernist Myth of the Self (University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 105; and in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 3, Peintures, 1887\u20131898 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 241, letter 923.\n\nThe title of the Art Institute painting has changed over the years. It has been called Torrent Dauphin\u00e9 (in 1934 and 1957), suggesting a geographical location and atmospheric condition that is not represented. The title was changed to Torrent, Creuse in 1974.

That he was thinking about Belle-\u00cele is also evident in his comment that Flaubert, had he been a painter, may have written differently. Monet was remembering, no doubt, Flaubert\u2019s travel account, which included his impressions of Belle-\u00cele, Par les champs et par les gr\u00e8ves (voyage en Bretagne), accompagn\u00e9 de m\u00e9langes et fragments in\u00e9dits, published by Monet\u2019s friend and patron, Georges Charpentier in 1886.

Monet\u2019s interest in the old oak went beyond the Petite Creuse series, and he painted a large single picture of this tree, Old Oak at Fresselines (1889; destroyed during WWI [W1231]).

See Octave Mirbeau, \u201cClaude Monet,\u201d Le figaro, Mar. 10, 1889, p. 1. Or, as Tucker suggests, he was responding to the panic he was feeling about his important joint exhibition (with Rodin) scheduled to open at Galerie Georges Petit in June; see Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat.

The need to control nature would be addressed even more dramatically in Monet's later series.\n\nIn Monet\u2019s letter to Alice Hosched\u00e9 on May 9, 1889, he writes, \u201cI am in a state of joy: the unhoped-for permission to remove the leaves of my handsome oak has been graciously granted! It was a big business to bring large enough ladders into the ravine. Finally it has been done; two men have been occupied with it since yesterday\u201d; translated in Steven Z.

In addition, flattened areas of paint around edges suggest that it was framed while the paint was still wet.\n\nWith the exception of the seventeen canvases from his trip to Antibes, 1888, this was the largest series. See Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 32. On June 15, 1889, Monet installed his paintings in Georges Petit\u2019s gallery in two tiers, \u201cwithout concern for chronological order, although the fourteen Creuse paintings are grouped together.\u201d Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 218.\n\nOctave Mirbeau says that \u201cIl divisa son travail, sur un plan m\u00e9thodique, rationnel, d\u2019une inflexible rigueur, en quelque sorte math\u00e9matique\u201d (He divided his work on a methodical plan, rational, an inflexible rigor, in some way mathematical). Octave Mirbeau, \u201cClaude Monet,\u201d Le figaro, Mar. 10, 1889, p. 1. Monet was in some cases an active participant in his own myth-making.

Stuckey, ed., Monet: A Retrospective (1985), pp. 89\u201393, an interview with Monet that coincided with his 1880 exhibition held at La Vie Moderne. It has been argued that this interview was the basis for the legend of the artist working en plein air and that Monet was at least partly responsible for its creation.

The Art Institute\u2019s Petite Creuse shares a warp-thread match with several other Monet canvas paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection dating from the years following the Creuse campaign, including four versions of Stacks of Wheat: Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269]), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270]), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278]), and Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284]) (see also Technical Report). While the Creuse campaign may be considered the first of Monet\u2019s series, the stacks of wheat paintings, shown together at the Durand-Ruel gallery in May 1891, would concretize the idea of \u201cseries\u201d for the artist as a method of picture making and expanding the message and meaning of the motif.

Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (nature light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF and PLM analysis indicate that the paint mixture contains mostly vermilion with traces of viridian, red lake, and lead white; other pigments may also be present.

The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the current dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, in addition to other factors such as restretching of the canvas on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet The Petite Creuse River (W1231/1922.432),\u201d Oct. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the canvases for these paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric.

One particle of barium sulfate was also detected in the ground sample. The ground was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_432\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Nov. 25, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_432\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Creuse\\_22\\_432\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 4, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe area of disturbed paint is approximately 29 cm long, 1 cm wide, and is located 1 cm from the top edge.\n\nOther fine black particles, possibly charcoal, were observed in some samples by PLM. Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_432\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue, bone black (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Iron oxides may also be present, based on the detection of traces of iron in areas analyzed by XRF. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_432\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_report,\u201d Nov. 15, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_432\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Nov. 25, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Creuse\\_22\\_432\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 4, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.
