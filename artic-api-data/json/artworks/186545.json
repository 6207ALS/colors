    "description": "<p><em>Woman in Tub</em>, based on a postcard, depicts a female nude acting out a crude sexual joke in the bathtub. Jeff Koons explained: \u201cThere\u2019s a snorkel and somebody is doing something to her under the water because she\u2019s grabbing her breasts for protection. But the viewer also wants to victimize her.\u201d The cartoonlike rendering of the form belies the exquisite hard-paste porcelain finish, typical of 18th-century Rococo figurines. Part of his <em>Banality</em> series, which is characterized by oddly eroticized, comic, and kitsch images, this work demonstrates Duchampian and Pop Art strategies of appropriation and, combining imagery from multiple sources, makes the primary subject taste itself.</p>\n",
