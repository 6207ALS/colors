    "short_description": "The architectural ingenuity produced in Chicago has led many to refer to it as the cradle of modern architecture. However, as tastes evolved, technologies shifted, and appeals for progress rang loud, we lost many pieces of greatness that embodied Chicago\u2019s history and architectural heritage. With Chicago: Lost and Found, we pay tribute to some of our beloved city\u2019s lost structures\u2014some well-known icons, but mostly lesser-known gems\u2014and celebrate a handful of reused buildings.",
