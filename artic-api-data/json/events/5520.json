    "description": "<p>Join adjunct lecturer Annie Morse as she discusses Takashi Murakami's <em>Mr. Pointy,</em>&nbsp;a gift of the Edlis Neeson Collection.</p><p>Artists draw inspiration from across world history and through their own experience of culture and society. In&nbsp;Takashi Murakami's dazzling&nbsp;<em>Mr. Pointy</em>, comic elements of anime and graphic art combine with ancient religious symbols to offer the viewer an intriguing example of contemporary Pop art with a profound spiritual foundation. In this illustrated lecture, we'll take a closer look at the many layers of Murakami's \"Superflat\" style and the elements he drew from global sources, as represented in the Art Institute's renowned collection.</p><p><em>Generously supported by the Carol Given Winston Fund. </em></p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
