    "description": "<p>This luminous bowl was made using the laborious and time-consuming composition-cast mosaic glass technique. The particular combination of colors and patterns suggests that this lovely dish was created in the Eastern Mediterranean, a region that grew wealthy from trade with Asian cultures. The town homes and country houses of the local elite boasted beautifully frescoed walls, colorful mosaic floors, and lush, private gardens embellished with decorative sculptures for the sumptuous alfresco banquets that were a favorite evening pastime. This delicate mosaic glass dish was likely made to adorn a splendidly set dinner table alongside other exquisitely wrought platters, bowls, and goblets.</p>\n",
