    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Poster developed from Edvard Munch\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Scream,</em>&nbsp;1895, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Edvard Munch\u2019s work has been frequently connected to his emotional pain and instability, as his iconic work&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Scream</em>&nbsp;suggests. However, when his art is considered in light of his personal diaries and letters and the writings of contemporary critics, a very different picture of the artist emerges. Contrary to the prevailing view, recent scholarship demonstrates that Munch was very much in control of his professional career, a savvy businessman keenly aware of how to manipulate the art market and shape popular opinion. Moreover, he built his art on specifically Norwegian pictorial traditions.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 37.75 x 27 in.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> Premium Cardstock</li></ul><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Additional Shipping $15 per Order.</em></p><p><em>This item cannot be shipped to a destination outside the United States.</em></p>",
