They all had children and wanted to build a community centered around them. By pooling their resources, they were able to purchase one hundred acres along the Hardnose River in Virginia, naming their new home for the old poplar tree that stood at the head of a clear spring. Each year, the founding of the community is celebrated there.\n\nAt its peak, Springtree was home to fifteen adults and fifteen children. It was, and still is, a close-knit intentional community in which ownership of land, homes and income is shared equally\u2014a single checkbook still serves all. There is no leader or hierarchy. As a group they have never had an ambition for larger social change or commercial success, focusing instead on living well together (some might say their way of life is social change). Home schooling was a key element, and each child had an adult read with him or her nightly.\n\nNot only did the group initially live together in the large house that they built, they also vacationed together. They drove by school bus to the outer banks of North Carolina and camped. The annual trip to the beach now functions as a reunion for Springtree members, their children and grandchildren.\n\nTime and change have slowly eroded the community\u2019s numbers\u2014two couples and an occasional intern live at Springtree today, sharing meals and conversation, and working in the garden and orchards together. An extensive calendar of visits from and to the world at large often interrupts the routine of farm work.\n\nAsked what she was thinking when this group portrait was made, Ruth Klippstein responded, \u201cThough I\u2019m not very smiley in the picture, I imagine I was thinking the main thoughts that make me happy: this is my place, these are my people. It\u2019s great to be rooted.\u201d \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
