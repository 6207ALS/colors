    "description": "<p>Shirley Craven, the designer of this textile, became chief designer and art director for Hull Traders in the early 1960s, shortly after graduating from the Royal College of Art, London. <em>Kaplan</em>, which captures a rugged landscape\u2014possibly the dramatic rocky coastline of Hull where Craven grew up\u2014proved to be a consistently popular design for the firm. Launched in 1961 in three color schemes, Craven added three more in 1963. The abstract reference to the landscape speaks to a larger aesthetic trend of the period that also features in Zandra Rhodes\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/241229\"><em>Stalactite</em></a> (1964) for Heal\u2019s Fabrics and Pentti Rinta\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59948\"><em>Myrsky (Tempest)</em></a> (1977) for Marimekko Oy.</p>\n<p>In addition to its market popularity, <em>Kaplan</em> was included in the exhibition <em>Brown, Craven, Dodd: Three Textile Designers</em> at the Whitworth Art Gallery at the University of Manchester in 1965. The exhibition catalogue noted that the artists\u2019 \u201cwork suggests close affinities not only to contemporary architecture but to contemporary movements in painting.\u201d Indeed, the heavily saturated pigments, used in hand screenprinting the textiles, rest on the surface like paint, giving the finished fabric a stiffer, more substantial feel that conveys a sense of luxury.</p>\n",
