    "description": "<p>Emphasizing the basics of line, shape, and color, Ellsworth Kelly\u2019s exquisitely spare paintings and sculpture influenced the development of Minimalist art and affected the course of color-field painting, hard-edge painting, and postpainterly abstraction. Among the Art Institute\u2019s rich holdings of Kelly\u2019s works, <em>Red Yellow Blue White and Black</em> stands apart: with startling clarity, this painting marks the moment at midcentury when Kelly\u2019s pure abstraction emerged in its mature form. After serving in World War II, the artist returned to Europe in 1948, living and working in France for the following six years. While abroad, Kelly expanded his practice of direct observation of nature and architectural forms into an experimental, rigorous study of abstraction. He made <em>Red Yellow Blue White and Black</em> in 1953 while still in France, creating it just as he was beginning to uncover the nearly infinite possibilities of monochrome, color spectrum, chance ordering, and multipanel composition. In the painting, Kelly centered the black panel so that it both divides and joins the three panels on either side of it, while the white panels simultaneously separate colors and pair them off. The blue panels at either end close and unify the sequence. Kelly\u2019s multipanel monochromes rely on the edges where sections meet, instead of handmade marks, to express their form. This seven-panel painting is the largest in a sequence of Paris-based works widely considered to be the artist\u2019s finest and most influential early statements on canvas.</p>\n",
