He was member of the Beefsteak Club as well as the Arts Club, where one evening he drew this impromptu portrait of Whistler on a scrap of paper and gave it to Justin McCarthy, an Irish literary figure and politician. About two years later, Whistler presented Pellegrini with a <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14526\">freely drawn sketch</a> after his oil painting <em>Arrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder</em> (1876\u201378; Frick Collection, New York), referring to the Italian-born artist in his dedication as \u201cmon Eleve,\u201d or \u201cmy pupil.\u201d</p>\n",
