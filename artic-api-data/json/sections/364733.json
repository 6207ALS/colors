Today, although the New Bond Street area still includes Avery Row, the shop itself has vanished and the mews cannot be identified with certainty. The building would have been only a short distance from the Fine Art Society\u2019s premises at 148 New Bond Street, where Whistler\u2019s lithographs were shown from mid-December 1895 through January 1896. With its large bay window and lively signs advertising \u201cHaircutting,\u201d \u201cRooms,\u201d and \u201cCigars,\u201d the storefront must have caught the artist\u2019s eye as he walked in the neighborhood.\n\nWhistler sketched The Barber\u2019s Shop in the Mews on a sheet of fine-grained transfer paper (papier viennois, no. 1), a paper he had used frequently in the past but which he had avoided since 1894. He probably drew the image in early January 1896, for it was a late addition to the exhibition at the Fine Art Society, which closed at the end of January. It was also one of five lithographs added to the second edition of the exhibition catalogue (app. V.1).\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (254 \u00d7 195 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 225 mm), signed.
