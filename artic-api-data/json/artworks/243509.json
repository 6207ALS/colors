    "description": "<p>During the 1940s, the building industry in the United States was gearing up for an anticipated boom in residential construction after the end of World War II. Lacking clients during the war years, architect L. Morgan Yost had remarkable success as the editor of Household Magazine and Small Homes Guide, two publications dedicated to encouraging the dream of homeownership for young enlisted men and their wives. Yost produced a range of model house designs for these magazines, often variations of the popular ranch style, published with sentimental titles such as House for Children. While designs like House Study #230 mimic low-cost houses built across the nation by the Levitt Brothers and other large developers, Yost developed a number of inventive domestic designs incorporating dynamic partitions or a prefabricated bathroom.</p>\n",
