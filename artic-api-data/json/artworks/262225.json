    "description": "<p>An artist and educator, as well as a diplomat, Elmer Forsberg taught classes on drawing, painting, composition, illustration and mural design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1906 until his death in 1950. Finnish-born, Forsberg also served as Finland\u2019s Consul in Chicago from 1924 to 1942. As an artist, Forsberg was well known for his landscapes and portraits, which he exhibited regionally and at the Art Institute. A scrapbook of newspaper clippings of exhibitions and criticism of his own paintings also mentions his students\u2019 work, Forsberg\u2019s political activities, and work in the Finnish community. The collection also contains some correspondence and photographs of his paintings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Forsberg,%20Elmer%20A.,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
