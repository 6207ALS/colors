The artist used bold, thick strokes of paint in bright colors to render a portrayal of vibrant yet haunting intensity\u2014seemingly capturing his psyche as well as his appearance\u2014which could allude to his struggle for personal and public acceptance as a gay black man.</p>\n<p>The son of a Tennessee preacher, Delaney studied art in Boston before settling in 1929 in New York, where he befriended artists such as Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and Jackson Pollock as well as writer James Baldwin, with whom he formed an especially deep, intellectual relationship of mutual inspiration and mentorship.</p>\n",
