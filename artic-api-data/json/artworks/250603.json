    "description": "<p>Maren Hassinger began taking dance classes even before she started formal schooling. While at Bennington College, her interest in dance and choreography shifted to a focus on sculpture informed by her prior exploration of movement and an object\u2019s relationship to space. Hassinger was the first student to specialize in fiber-based art within the Sculpture MFA program at the University of California in Los Angeles. During that time, she began working with wire rope, which she described as \u201copen to innovation.\u201d She combined steel cable with tree branches to create sculptures that, in her words, \u201cresembled living, breathing things.\u201d By juxtaposing these materials, Hassinger sought to maintain a balance between the natural and the made, between fragility and strength\u2014and also to express equality, by joining the sculpture\u2019s opposing ends.</p>\n<p>Hassinger collected the material for <em>Interlock</em> in a salvage yard on Alameda Street in Los Angeles. As is characteristic of Hassinger\u2019s early wire-rope sculptures, Interlock visibly reflects the process of its production; the artist combined the found materials with industrially produced elements, revealing the tension between technology and nature. This work is also a key example of how Hassinger uses bodily movement to make artistic production possible and distinctive. Scaled to her own body, Interlock shows how Hassinger\u2019s sculptural practice is rooted in her dance and performance background, collapsing these genres into the physical space in and around the work.<p>\n",
