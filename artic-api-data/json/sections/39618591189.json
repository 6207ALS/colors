The wood-block print Oviri is informed by the largest and among the most important ceramic pieces the artist made, his 1894 sculpture of the goddess (fig. 84.1 [Gray 113]), as well as the 1892 oil painting Noa Noa, whose present location is unknown (fig. 84.2 [W 487]).\n\nNoa Noa depicts an area near Gauguin\u2019s dwelling in the Mataeia district of Tahiti Nui (see Scented Sites); a related view can be seen in another canvas from the same year, Fatata te moua (At the Foot of a Mountain), which features a grove of mango trees, palm trees, and the artist\u2019s abode (fig. 84.3 [W 481]). If one reverses the wood-block print and compares it to a superimposition of the sculpture Oviri, also reversed, over Noa Noa, the close relationship of the settings of the painting and print becomes evident (fig. 84.4).\n\nThe sculpture shows Oviri with long, cascading hair, glazed white; her large head displays exaggerated features, especially her enlarged, empty, and mesmerizing eyes. Her knees bent, the full-length figure seems to sway. She stands with two animals: her left hand holds the helpless, drooping body of a wolf cub, while her right hand grasps its neck with the force of a stranglehold. Crushed beneath her is a dying or dead she-wolf; its blood pools at her feet and stains her tresses.\n\nThese details are less evident in the extant impressions of the Oviri wood-block print, cloaked as they are in mottled layers and uneven textures of thickly applied inks of various colors, from black to brown, from deep orange to deep yellow ocher. Nonetheless, one can identify at the figure\u2019s right a coconut palm, flowering caper bush, and the spiky blades of what might be a peacock plant\u2014all of which feature in the painting Noa Noa but which are more summarily depicted in the print. The impressions under discussion here (cat. 84.1, cat. 84.2, cat. 84.3, and cat. 84.4) do not suggest the verdant setting of the lost Noa Noa painting. Rather, they evoke a humid, dense rain forest in which one might come upon a lichen-covered statue of a deity (see fig. 84.5). An atmosphere of mystery and menace prevails.\n\nDrawings in a sketchbook known as the Album Walter demonstrate that Gauguin frequented the Assyrian galleries at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, in the mid-to-late 1880s. Open to the public since 1847, these installations featured monumental relief sculptures, discovered in 1843, that graced the facade of the throne room at the palace of the eighth-century B.C. Assyrian king Sargon II (see fig. 84.6 left). Among them are two powerful representations of the legendary hero Gilgamesh choking a lion whose body hangs under one of the hero\u2019s arms much like the baby wolf in Gauguin\u2019s ceramic Oviri (see fig. 84.6 right). Gilgamesh\u2019s decoratively embellished and stylized muscular legs caught Gauguin\u2019s attention, as one sheet in the sketchbook demonstrates (see fig. 84.7). It is quite possible that the relief sculptures of Gilgamesh inspired the Oviri-themed works in his oeuvre.\n\nAnother possible source is an element of the decoration Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix executed in the Salon du Roi in the Palais du Corps L\u00e9gislatif, Paris, between 1833 and 1837. One of the eight pilasters that the French Romantic artist painted with personifications of the rivers of France is that of the Araris, the Latin name for the Sa\u00f4ne. It depicts a muscular water deity holding a large fish in a manner similar to that in which Oviri grasps the wolf cub (fig. 84.8).\n\nFor the Oviri wood-block print, Gauguin used the verso of the boxwood block that he had employed as the matrix for Te atua (The God), plate 3 of his Noa Noa Suite. This was the first time he recyled a Noa Noa matrix; he eventually used the same matrix, its parts now separated, for other prints. The matrix for Te atua, comprising six sections screwed together (see fig. 84.9), had begun to separate at the joints. In 1896 he inventively incorporated a portion of the Oviri print into a new image, allowing the split in the wood to function as part of the trunk of a breadfruit tree, which is being harvested by a woman who turns to look at the goddess. The resulting composition (fig. 84.10 [Kornfeld 36, [[Field 1973] 11]), although modest in scale, possesses an expansive landscape background against which Oviri and the woman are prominently displayed. It is as if Oviri has been released from her prior confinement and mysterious surrounds into a light-filled environment.\n\nGauguin did not limit his recycling to boxwood matrices. He executed impressions of Oviri and other prints on the versos of fragments of discarded impressions of the Noa Noa Suite printed by Louis Roy. A similar fate even befell some rare counterproofs that Gauguin had pulled from pastel drawings. The verso of cat. 84.1 (fig. 84.11) is a cut-down section of a counterproof (fig. 84.12 [Field 1973 11) taken from the recto of a double-sided drawing showing a reclining nude (fig. 84.13; see also fig. 84.14).\n\nOne can trace the conceptual origin of the Oviri sculpture to an oil painting that Gauguin executed in Tahiti in 1892, E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?) (fig. 84.15 [W 478]). In addition to featuring two crouching females in the middle ground in front of a shack with a pitched roof, the right foreground is occupied by a three-quarter-length depiction of a Tahitian woman, naked from the waist up. She supports an animal with both hands, much as Oviri does in Gauguin\u2019s sculpture. Unlike the violence and cruelty implied in the ceramic work, the woman in the painting seems to caress the animal, perhaps a pet, she holds.\n\nTwo watercolor monotypes from 1894/95 study the ceramic Oviri from different angles: in one the figure is seen in a three-quarter view from the side, but reversed; in the other, it is observed from the front (fig. 84.16 and fig. 84.17). Gauguin very likely included a vignette-like pen, ink, and wash drawing of the same period, based on the finished sculpture, in a letter to a correspondent (fig. 84.18).\n\nGauguin created a plaster relief sculpture\u2014a self-portrait in profile\u2014at the time he was engaged in making his ceramic Oviri (see fig. 84.19 [Gray 109]). The goddess must have been very much on his mind and the connection he felt with her primitive, savage nature so strong that he inscribed her name above his countenance. He added his monogram, PGO, in the upper left, underscoring his identification with Oviri. A crested bird, a motif that is ubiquitous in the artist\u2019s work (perhaps a peacock or peahen) appears at the upper right. In the artist\u2019s 1890/91 drawing Soyez symboliste (Be a Symbolist [Portrait of Jean Mor\u00e9as]) (fig. 84.20), not only does the crested bird in the upper right appear as a mirror image of that in the bronze, but peacock feathers feature prominently behind the three-quarter profile in the composition.\n\nIn a drawing by Gauguin of a sculpture, he transformed Oviri into the Roman goddess of the hunt (fig. 84.21). Diana presumably holds a wolf cub, with a second animal at her feet; her name is emblazoned on the base. The way in which the animal wriggles to escape the clutches of its mistress suggests that we are not witnessing a life-and-death struggle but rather a humorous, everyday one, that of a reluctant pet perhaps protesting an impending bath.\n\nThe exact date for this sheet is difficult to establish. The writer Charles Morice, Gauguin\u2019s collaborator on Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, referred to Gauguin\u2019s sculpture as \u201cDiane chasseureuse\u201d (Diana the Hunter) in a letter to the poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 from February or March 1895 in connection with a public subscription, for which the former was hoping to enlist the latter\u2019s endorsement, to fund the acquisition of the Oviri sculpture for the French nation (an effort that failed). Gauguin left France for Tahiti the following June. Whether Gauguin executed the drawing in response to the connection Morice drew between Oviri and Diana cannot be determined, but most likely he made the sheet in late 1894 or early 1895. In an article in the December 1896 issue of Les hommes d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui, Morice again identified Oviri with Diana, seeing them both as symbols of death and fertility, destruction and regeneration.\n\nOviri appears in an 1898 oil painting, Rave te hiti aamu (The Idol) (fig. 84.22 [W 570]) as an imposing statue next to the trunk and branches of a beach hibiscus tree. This bright, richly hued landscape, with a view to the island of Moorea across an expanse of water, is what Gauguin could see every day from his house in Puna\u2019auia, Tahiti. It echoes the open vista the artist created two years before in his small print Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (fig. 84.10).\n\nFinally, a 1900/1901 manuscript version of Gauguin\u2019s broadsheet Le sourire (The Smile) carries an illustration of Oviri surrounded by text (fig. 84.23). The caption that accompanies the pen-and-ink drawing reads, \u201cAnd the monster, embracing its creation, filled her generous womb with seed and fathered S\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta.\u201d The latter is a reference to Balzac\u2019s 1834 novel S\u00e9raph\u00eeta, whose main character is androgynous (see Commentary).\n\nWhen Gauguin departed Paris for Tahiti in 1895, he left the ceramic Oviri behind, entrusting it to the dealer L\u00e9vy, after which it was deposited with the artist\u2019s good friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid. Gauguin was distressed that it did not find an owner, for he considered it to be one of his finest works. Even though he continued to hope it would sell, in October 1900, the artist wrote to Monfreid that he wanted his ceramic Oviri to grace his tomb. It took nearly seventy years to fulfill Gauguin\u2019s wish. He was buried on May 9, 1903\u2014the day after his death. On March 28, 1973, a bronze version of Oviri was placed on his tomb in the Cimiti\u00e8re Calvaire, Atuona, Hiva Oa, Marquesas Islands (fig. 84.24).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">Although Gauguin revisited the imagery he invented frequently, in its apparent importance to the artist, Oviri stands alone. No other character in his iconography is as unsettling in appearance and, in existing accounts, no other seems to have had equal personal significance.\n\nAs the impressions at the Art Institute demonstrate, the figure appears in numerous wood-block prints, all variants on two compositions (Tahitian Idol\u2014The Goddess Hina [cat. 82] and Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri [cat. 85]). It also features in a drawing from 1894/95 whose current location is unknown (see fig. 84.25); two watercolor monotypes from 1894/95 (fig. 84.26 [Field 1973 30; and fig. 84.27 Field 1973 31]); an 1898 painting entitled Rave te hiti ramu (The Idol) (fig. 84.28 [W 570]); and a late drawing included in a special edition of the artist\u2019s Le sourire (The Smile) (fig. 84.29). Most memorably, it is the subject of a ceramic statue that Gauguin made in the winter of 1894\u201395 (fig. 84.30 [Gray 130]) that has the word OVIRI modeled on the front of its base. The majority of those writing about the sculpture in the twentieth century considered that the artist first developed the theme in three dimensions. However, in 1988 Richard Brettell suggested that the works on paper predated the sculpture. Although, as Brettell allowed, an exact chronology remains elusive, Gauguin\u2019s use of a Louis Roy impression of Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) from the Noa Noa Suite as a support for one of the Art Institute\u2019s prints (cat. 82.2) indicates that the monotypes and wood-block prints cannot predate the end of 1894.\n\nEven if the works on paper were completed before Gauguin made his definitive return to Tahiti in 1895, the early exhibition of the ceramic is uncertain, as it may or may not have appeared in the salon of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts that year. In 1937 the dealer Ambroise Vollard claimed that the ceramicist Ernest Chaplet, who had mentored Gauguin in his use of clay, had threatened to pull his own works from the salon if its jury rejected Oviri (which would imply that Gauguin had submitted the sculpture for consideration). Given the frequently anecdotal character of Vollard\u2019s recollections, the tale seems far-fetched, but the ceramic Oviri was most probably fired in the ceramicist\u2019s kiln. In an article that appeared in Le soir on April 25, 1895, Gauguin praised Chaplet\u2019s support of his efforts \u201cto replace the potter at his wheel by intelligent hands which could impart the life of a face to a vase and yet remain true to the character of the material used.\u201d These words acknowledged that Chaplet was central to Gauguin\u2019s technical experiments in the 1890s and, as art historian Dario Gamboni observed recently, the ceramic Oviri demonstrates how the artist allowed process to influence the genesis of a work of art. This consideration is as relevant to Gauguin\u2019s printmaking as it is to his work in three dimensions; the execution of the images, as seen in the Oviri-related prints in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, seems to have added new layers of meaning to the already complex iconography of the uncanny statuette. The artist made seventeen original impressions of the earlier print, emphasizing and obscuring details in turn, although no single example appears as a definitive version.\n\nOver the course of several years, from 1895 to 1902, Gauguin referred to the motif and the work, directly or indirectly, on several occasions, although never as \u201cOviri.\u201d This is significant. Posthumous commentary has tended to understand the word as a name, linked to Oviri-moe-aihere\u2014a god who rules over death and mourning in Tahitian mythology\u2014which Teruia Henry (a late-nineteenth/early-twentieth-century chronicler of Tahitian mythology) translated as \u201cWild man sleeping in reeds.\u201d But, according to Polynesian language expert Jack Ward, the name of the god is more accurately translated as \u201cman sleeping in the wilderness\u201d; whereas the word \u014dviri is more typically an adjective that can mean \u201cwild\u201d: mo\u2019ra \u014dviri means \u201cwild pig,\u201d for instance, while pua\u2019a \u014dviri translates as \u201cwild duck,\u201d referring to a state of being rather than to a character. This further destabilizes the task of interpretation, as it suggests that Gauguin did not name his figure but instead labeled it as if it were a categorized item in an ethnographic display. Perhaps Gauguin anticipated that the figure would be judged as other by a European\u2014or a Polynesian\u2014onlooker. This might explain why, when the artist inscribed the word above his likeness in a plaster relief self-portrait (see fig. 84.31 [Gray 109]), he did not include an image of the strange figure that is the subject of the Art Institute\u2019s prints. Gauguin recognized that, like the Oviri motif, he was also a curiosity in his geographical and cultural contexts. Nevertheless, as the possible meanings of the moniker multiply, it seems increasingly likely that the artist intended no one fixed interpretation for the figure. For this reason, breaking from English titling conventions for the works, this catalogue refers to the prints simply as Oviri, without the traditional subtitle \u201cSavage.\u201d Gauguin\u2019s slight statements on his images of Oviri are by no means conclusive; and given that he made them at various points of his career, it is possible, as Barbara Landy recognized in the 1960s, that the significance of the motif for the artist changed over time. Accordingly, while they serve as a useful point of departure in the task of tackling this difficult subject, they signal a series of dualities rather than one clear interpretive path.\n\nThe earliest comment Gauguin made about the motif appears on the shared mount of two prints in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (cats. 84.3 and 84.4), which bears an 1895 dedication to the poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Without specifying a name for the combined works, the artist called the subject of the prints \u201cthis strange figure cruel enigma.\u201d The double presentation of the character, in different colorations, reinforces the idea that its identity is, indeed, enigmatic. Meanwhile, the layers of media in the images (of ocher and, respectively, brown and black ink, with touches of black ink applied by hand in one instance [cat. 84.1]) merge and obscure detail as a reiteration of the figure\u2019s unknowable complexity. As Peter Zegers notes, the details seen in the ceramic\u2014the figure, knees bent, stands on a bleeding and dead (or dying) animal and clutches another with one hand\u2014are obscured or eliminated in the wood-block prints, in which the figure resembles a stone idol in an overgrown forest setting (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). This may align the prints with Gauguin\u2019s belief that visual art can prioritize suggestion over representation, a capacity more usually associated with poetry in Symbolist circles. Interestingly, when the poet and critic Andr\u00e9 Fontainas complained in 1899 that Gauguin\u2019s work did not represent specific Tahitian or Marquesan settings, the artist evoked Mallarm\u00e9 in his response, in justification of his art\u2019s deliberate ambiguity: \u201cIt is a musical poem, it needs no libretto,\u201d he stated, quoting the poet, after explaining, \u201cMy dream is intangible. It comprises no allegory.\u201d Given that Gauguin presented the Art Institute\u2019s pair of images to his friend Mallarm\u00e9, it is surely likely that the former, mindful of their creative exchange, imagined that the latter would draw his own conclusions as to their meaning.\n\nThe most solid identification Gauguin gave of the figure\u2014this time in relation to his ceramic\u2014was in an April 1897 letter to Vollard. Therein the artist referred to it not as Oviri, but as \u201cThe Murderess\u201d and indicated that he deemed the work \u201cexceptional.\u201d Although in his written travel account Noa Noa, Voyage to Tahiti, Gauguin used the metaphor of woodcutting to convey how he destroyed his European self and became Polynesian, the suggestion made by one scholar that his invented figure relates to this symbolic \u201ckilling\u201d seems implausible. Rather, if oviri is used as an adjective, the inference is that his \u201cmurderess\u201d\u2014like the artist himself\u2014was \u201cwild.\u201d\n\nThe text Gauguin wrote on a drawing of the figure made in preparation for his satirical journal Le sourire (fig. 84.31) certainly characterizes the figure as untamed: \u201cAnd the monster, holding its creature, impregnates with its seed a generous abdomen in order to engender S\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta.\u201d The grammar of the sentence in French is vague; the gerund (\u00e9traignant) could indicate a \u201cholding\u201d that is either strangulation or embrace. However, based on Gauguin\u2019s earlier reference to Oviri as a \u201cmurderess,\u201d it seems likely that the \u201cmonster\u2019s\u201d grip is one of sinister intent.\n\nThe gender of Oviri is also unclear. In French the word monstre is masculine, which, in turn, would imply that so too is Gauguin\u2019s \u201cMurderess\u201d; she impregnates herself with the animal\u2019s seed, as the inseminator becomes the inseminated.\n\nGiven that Gauguin gendered his creature female and male in turn, the reference to S\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta and the doubling of the print on one mount take on increased significance. Honor\u00e9 de Balzac\u2019s novel S\u00e9raph\u00eeta was popular in Symbolist circles; its characters experience the protagonist of the title as either woman or man. At the end of the book, S\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta emerges as the human incarnation of angelic androgyny whose laments include the following: \u201cAll beings spend a first life in the sphere of Instinct where they work to realize the futility of the earthly treasures they have given so much to amass. How many times does one live in this first world before leaving it prepared to start over with other trials in the sphere of Abstractions, where thought is taken up with pseudo sciences, where the mind lets go at last of human discourse; because, when Matter is exhausted, Spirit comes.\u201d Such lofty rejection of the literal\u2014which is in keeping with some of Gauguin\u2019s own statements\u2014and the circulation of Balzac\u2019s novel among the artist\u2019s Parisian associates allow for the possibility that he identified with the character. In his 1893 manuscript Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline), Gauguin had indicated that Balzac sought suggestion over representation, as he clearly did in his own art.\n\nSome writers have understood Oviri as a stand-in for the artist, or, as Henri Dorra suggested, for his half-Peruvian grandmother, Flora Tristan. Gauguin made a wood casket, seemingly inspired by the Norse tombs that he had seen in his wife\u2019s native Copenhagen, which contains a carved adolescent figure. The figure, which may be a self-portrait, assumes the same pose as the ceramic Oviri, a possible indication that the artist connected his own identity with that of his invention (see fig. 84.32). Alternatively (or simultaneously), Gauguin may have associated the genderless divinity with his Tahitian neighbors. In his writings, notably, he perceived and celebrated what he saw as the lack of differentiation in their physiognomy, whether male or female.\n\nIn any of these scenarios, of ultimate significance is the fact that, with this reference, the idea of duality emerges once again. Laurence Madeline observed that androgyny was a concern in Gauguin\u2019s art from his time in Britanny, and more recently Yeon Shim Yung argued that the ceramic Oviri, as well as being a statement of Gauguin\u2019s mature artistic credo, was a development of the late-nineteenth-century Symbolist femme fatale and androgyne. In a letter of 1888 to Madeleine Bernard (sister of the artist \u00c9mile Bernard), Gauguin advised her to regard herself \u201cas a sexless Androgyne; by that I mean that the soul, the heart, in short all that is divine, must not be a slave of matter, that is of the body.\u201d Perhaps, in writing those lines, he took inspiration from Balzac. As Zegers demonstrates, the potential sources for the image are not discernibly of either gender (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). In 1963 Christopher Gray suggested that the figure\u2019s head was based partly on a Marquesan idol and partly on the remains of a deified chieftain whose mummified skull had mother-of-pearl eyes. Henri Dorra identified the origins of the piece in earlier works by Gauguin: in the personifications of Eve in Breton works, including Two Women Bathing (1887 [W 215, W 2002 241]) and the foreground figure in E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?) (1892 [W 478]) and Woman with a Mango (1893 [W 501]). Gamboni, meanwhile, read the opening at the back of the ceramic Oviri as simultaneously phallic and vaginal. All of these suggestions seem plausible, allowing multiple identities to coexist in the same curious motif and encouraging the viewer to broaden his or her reading.\n\nIf the drawing\u2019s reference to \u201cS\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta\u201d widens the interpretive context for the variations of Oviri, so too does its placement, when reproduced in Le sourire with, as stated above, the inscription \u201cAnd the monster, holding its creature, impregnates with its seed a generous abdomen in order to engender S\u00e9raphitus-S\u00e9raph\u00eeta.\u201d This line appears again, in a later edition of Le sourire (without the illustration) in a review that Gauguin wrote, under a pseudonym, of a fictitious play at the Grand Th\u00eaatre National in Bora Bora. Anna, a young woman, causes her suitor to die from shock when she delivers the news that she and her father are lovers. The review seems to cast the father as the monster for having impregnated his daughter, but Anna\u2019s happy account indicates that she was a willing participant. The artist seems to have enjoyed this salacious and morbid tale, no doubt because it connected with current literary trends. These include the theme of incest, which plays a key role in Istar (1888), a novel by writer and occultist Jos\u00e9phin P\u00e9ladan, whom Gauguin quoted at the close of Cahier pour Aline. In Istar, Satan\u2019s son and daughter come to Earth to atone for their father\u2019s sins. Instead of finding salvation, however, the siblings become sexual partners.\n\nIt seems likely that the article in Le sourire had its roots in the strange narrative of Istar. In addition to borrowing from its text, Gauguin may also have been attracted to the book\u2019s frontispiece, a design by the Belgian artist Fernand Khnopff (see fig. 84.33), whom P\u00e9ladan asked to provide illustrations for a number of his novels. The 1889 drawing for Istar was shown at the Galeries Georges Petit, Paris, the same year that Gauguin exhibited with the avant-garde Brussels-based group Les Vingt, which Khnopff had cofounded. Gauguin would surely have known the drawing either from the original or from a reproduction. Like the animals included in the ceramic Oviri, the creature that wraps itself around Khnopff\u2019s androgynous nude\u2014a primordial, phallic, organic mass\u2014is impossible to identify definitively. Gauguin\u2019s distinctive modeling techniques in his ceramic are also reminiscent of Khnopff\u2019s use of gesso duro (rough gesso) (see fig. 84.34). Many artists from Brussels participated in the Salon de la Rose + Croix, which P\u00e9ladan had founded and which outlawed imagery that was purely representational, and Gauguin would have been familiar with their work.\n\nOnce again, however, to introduce incestuous or occult themes is not to pin a single meaning to the Oviri motif. Quite the opposite: it is to acknowledge that they deny the possibility. As Philippe Dagen noted in his analysis of Cahier pour Aline, Gauguin\u2019s typical mode of expression therein was \u201cthesis, antithesis, and no conclusion.\u201d This seems equally true of his visual production, not only metaphorically but also quite literally. As Gauguin later reworked the wood blocks he had used for his first Oviri images, he altered the character of his invention, transforming it from an active creature to a static idol. The upper half of this figure appears in an 1896/97 wood-block print with the image of a woman picking fruit (cats. 85.1 and 85.2). As the Technical Study explains, contrary to previous understandings of the later print\u2019s fabrication, the juxtaposition of the two images was probably not prompted by a break in the original matrix, but rather by the artist\u2019s decision to carve around the subject and truncate the composition. With this act of cropping, Gauguin consciously reduced (or elevated) the \u201cstrange enigma\u201d that is the full-length figure in the previous Oviri prints to a totem. Placing it in the foreground of the new composition, he added a tree to separate it from the woman, suggesting physical distance by a contrast in scale. Oviri\u2019s strange face peers out at the viewer, a sinister presence in an otherwise timeless paradise, as in his Rave te hiti ramu. The multiplication of the motif in the artist\u2019s oeuvre makes it impossible to know whether, ultimately, the figure is a creature or symbol.\n\nGauguin\u2019s penultimate reference to the ceramic came in 1900, in a letter to his friend the artist Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, wherein he stipulated that he wanted the statue placed above his tomb in Tahiti on the event of his death. He asked that the \u201cbig ceramic\u201d be sent as soon as sufficient funds were available. However, while many writers have cited this request for the piece as a grave ornament as sure evidence of the significance of the work for Gauguin, it is important to note that the artist would have much preferred that it find a buyer. Vollard had written to Monfreid at the end of the same month, suggesting that a client might emerge for the \u201cmonstrous standing woman,\u201d so it is probably for this reason, rather than negligence on the part of Gauguin\u2019s friend, that the work remained in France. In 1901, with no sale having transpired, an exasperated Gauguin suggested that the work might sell to the artist and collector Gustave Fayet for 2,000 francs (Fayet would purchase it eventually, in 1905, for 500 francs less). In 1902 Gauguin reiterated to Vollard that Oviri was the \u201cbest thing of mine\u201d in the clear hope of securing a purchaser. He did not repeat his request to have the piece shipped to Tahiti, which indicates that he valued income over the object.\n\nCommentators have not tended to cite Gauguin\u2019s letter to Monfreid in full, but the complete text is interesting, for its tone is hardly reverential. Specifically, prior to employing the piece as a gravestone, the artist explained that he would use it to decorate his garden: an environment that, as an earlier request to Monfreid for seeds makes clear, was brightly colored and informal. The question of duality makes a final reemergence. The motif of Oviri, whether three- or two-dimensional, could be artist or \u201cother,\u201d male or female, living or dead, idol or embellishment. It is possible that, with the introduction of the strange composite creature, Gauguin hoped to ensure that viewers would adopt a more abstract way of seeing. As he wrote in Tahiti in the late 1890s, \u201cWe can always double the beauty of a landscape by looking at it with half-closed eyes. Sometimes the senses perceive too little, they always perceive too much.\u201d  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This state was not documented in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin prints; see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W.

But in fact Gauguin published mimeographed issues of Le sourire (The Smile) in Tahiti between August 1899 and April 1900. Since this is labeled \u201cXX\u201d at the top of the right-hand page, it is possible that the artist wrote this particular issue out by hand in 1900 or 1901.\n\nGauguin declared it to be \u201cthe best thing of mine\u201d in a letter to the dealer Ambroise Vollard on August 25, 1902.

Moreover, if Gauguin did submit the work to the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts, he might have done so deliberately to produce antagonism. Avant-garde works were commonplace among the annual exhibitions\u2014in 1895 the exhibitors included Maurice Denis and Carlos Schwabe\u2014but the jury would have struggled to accept the rough handling of Gauguin\u2019s ceramic sculpture. Earlier that year, while Oviri was on view at the gallery run by the art dealer L\u00e9vy at 57, rue Saint-Lazare, Charles Morice suggested to St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 that they try to have the piece (which he referred to as \u201cDiana the Huntress\u201d) rejected by the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. Getting the museum to accept it did not enter into their discussion, suggesting that Gauguin would not have anticipated the work finding supporters in that particular arena either.

However, in Loti\u2019s 1878 novel, Le mariage de Loti, the word is used as an insult in a fight between two girls and translated as \u201csavage\u201d (the girl who utters the word also calls her companion a \u201ccannibal\u201d); but the passage does not seem to connect with an account of the goddess. Anderson\u2019s reading, then, appears to represent an amalgamation of sources and thus can be set aside for the purposes of this interpretation, as can another analysis, by John E.

In addition to being inspired by Balzac and his interest in androgyny, it is possible that Gauguin knew P\u00e9ledan\u2019s 1884 novel Le vice supr\u00eame, in which an artist creates a sexless angel.\n\nRobert L. Delevoy, Catherine de Cro\u00ebs, and Giselle Ollinger-Zingue, Fernand Khnopff (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), pp. 240\u201341. Gauguin may also have been aware of Khnopff\u2019s experiments with gesso duro; on Knopff and this technique, see Michel Draguet, Knopff ou l\u2019ambigu po\u00e9tique (Broch\u00e9, 1999), p. 138.\n\nFor instance, Nancy Mowell Matthews suggested that, since Gauguin seems to have considered the fox the Indian symbol of perversity, Oviri might hold a fox that is the artist\u2019s alter ego, indicating gender instability and dangerous sexuality. Nancy Mowell Matthews, Paul Gauguin: An Erotic Life (Yale University Press, 2001), pp. 208\u20139. Henri Dorra read the animal at Oviri\u2019s side as a dog and the one at the figure\u2019s feet as a dog or wolf. Henri Dorra, The Symbolism of Paul Gauguin: Erotica, Exotica, and the Great Dilemmas of Humanity (University of California Press, 2007), pp. 235\u201336. Alternatively, a collarless wolf might allude to Gauguin\u2019s \u201cprimitive self\u201d; Degas had called Gauguin a wolf (in reference to a fable by La Fontaine), and the artist was clearly quite proud of the comparison. See Naomi Margolis Maurer, The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1998), p. 163.\n\nGauguin mentioned the Salon in his correspondence, although his feelings about the group are hard to discern.

Gauguin warned the young artist that he \u201cmay be exposed to a little ridicule over the Rosicrucians, although this may be a wonderful advertisement, believing that Art has no business in this house of Peladan [sic].\u201d\n\nPhilippe Dagen noted this particularly in relation to the elaborate description of Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (W 457) that Gauguin wrote in Cahier pour Aline. Dagen, preface to Paul Gauguin, Cahier pour Aline, Petite collection (\u00c9ds. du Sonneur, 2009), p. 9; see pp. 32\u201335 for Gauguin\u2019s explanation of the painting.\n\nJohn E.

In this letter, Gauguin asked his friend to send a selection of \u201csimple dahlias, nasturtiums and sunflowers of various sorts . . . whatever you can think of,\u201d so that he could decorate the grounds. The following April, he reported to Monfreid that he was enjoying the seeds and that the garden was a \u201cveritable Eden\u201d (p. 117, no. 41).\n\n\u201cNous pouvons toujours doubler la beaut\u00e9 d\u2019un paysage en le regardant des yeux \u00e0 demi clos.
