Ryerson Collection, 1933.1164\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Houses of Parliament, London was painted on a pre-primed, non-standard-size linen canvas, which was probably custom ordered. The ground is off-white and consists of two layers. A very fine, dotted line of blue paint was observed along the left and right edges of the composition. The purpose of the lines is unclear, but they appear to lie between the ground and the paint layers and seem to have been applied before the canvas was mounted on the stretcher. The paint layer was densely built up, and some areas of the composition were substantially reworked at a later stage. This includes the tallest tower, the edges of some of the other towers and spires, and the water in the lower right half of the composition, including the boat. The edges of the painting were also reworked in the final painting stages, covering areas of exposed ground. It appears that the paint used in the reworked areas contains a red lake pigment that has faded in areas where it was exposed to the light but retains its color in areas that were protected by the frame rebate. This has resulted in a distinct band of pinkish-gray paint that is visible especially along the left and bottom edges of the painting. An earlier signature was applied wet-in-wet with the painting, before the water in the lower right corner was reworked. The painting was then resigned in approximately the same location.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 41.1).\n\nSigned: Claude Monet (lower right, in light-reddish-brown paint) (fig. 41.2). It appears that the painting was signed twice, in the same location at the lower right corner. The earlier signature is slightly offset from the final one and is visible mainly because of the impression it made when it was applied wet-in-wet to the underlying paint layer. It is most easily discerned in the X-ray and in raking light (fig. 41.3 and fig. 41.4). Not all of the letters are legible, but Claude and part of the M can clearly be seen. No date is visible. A few breaks in the upper paint layers expose small areas of the earlier signature, which appears to have been executed in pale-orange-red paint (fig. 41.5). Along with other areas of the painting (see Application/Technique), the artist appears to have reworked the lower right corner at a later date and then resigned the painting. The earlier paint layers and signature were dry when the reworking was carried out. When the final signature was applied, some of the greenish-gray surface strokes of the water were still soft.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nAn examination report in the conservation file lists the previous (probably original; see Original Stretcher) stretcher dimensions as 80 \u00d7 91 cm. The dimensions of the painted composition are approximately 81 \u00d7 92 cm. Neither of these dimensions corresponds to a standard-size stretcher; standard-size stretcher bars were available, however, in 81 and 92 cm lengths (no. 25 and no. 30, respectively). The stretcher was probably custom ordered.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 17.5V (0.7) \u00d7 19.1H (0.5) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with any other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is cusping along all four sides of the canvas. It is more pronounced on the top edge. The cusping seems to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes on all sides, except on the top edge where some of the cusping appears to extend beyond the cut edge of the canvas.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1991 treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced approximately 2\u20135 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 5\u20138 cm apart. On the left, right, and bottom tacking edges, there are a few additional tack holes that do not correspond to the cusping pattern; these are probably from tacks added later. Microscopic examination of the edges of the painted composition revealed several additional holes just inside the painted area (fig. 41.6). The holes do not seem to be regularly or symmetrically spaced, and their origin and function are not known.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Six-membered, keyable stretcher with vertical and horizontal crossbars; dates to the 1991 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher was probably the original stretcher. The 1974 verso photograph and treatment report indicate that the previous stretcher consisted of six members, including a horizontal and a vertical crossbar (Buck type 2), with beveled back and keyable mortise and tenon joints (fig. 41.7). The report gives the following dimensions: overall, 80 \u00d7 91 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; inside depth, 1 cm; stretcher-bar width, 6 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 6 cm (see Conservation History).\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations. No marks are visible in the 1974 photograph of the original canvas back (fig. 41.7).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that two layers are present (fig. 41.8, fig. 41.9). Overall, the ground is very thin. The lower layer ranges from a few microns to 30 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from approximately 10 to 55 \u00b5m in thickness.\n\nWhen the painting surface is observed microscopically, only the upper ground layer is visible. It is off-white with some dark and possible red or brown particles visible under magnification (fig. 41.10).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower ground layer contains calcium sulfate with traces of silicates and calcium carbonate. The upper layer contains lead white with traces of iron oxide, ultramarine blue, calcium-based white, barium sulfate, and silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe palette is dominated by a range of grayish-blues and grayish-greens, with touches of pale pink scattered throughout the sky and the water. The artist worked up the composition as a whole, moving back and forth between the buildings, the sky, and the water. The paint layers are relatively continuous and heavily built up in areas, making it difficult to see how the work was initially laid in. Much of the surface texture comes from underlying brushstrokes that were covered by subsequent paint applications (fig. 41.11). The X-ray shows the dense mass of brushwork that covers most of the canvas (fig. 41.12).\n\nThe painting was reworked in several areas by the artist, after the earlier paint layers had had sufficient time to dry. This is evident in the tallest tower, where the paint is thicker than in other parts of the architecture, and the upper part of the tower stands out as the most radio-opaque area of the painting (fig. 41.13). The tower was reworked from just below the spires down to where it connects with the building (fig. 41.14). This reworking makes the tower appear more solid and distinct from the sky, compared with other parts of the buildings whose edges visually dissolve into the surroundings to a greater degree. The edges of some of the spires on the right side of the building were similarly reinforced with solid, vertical brushstrokes of a more-intense blue paint. The added strokes do not seem to have significantly altered the proportions of the structures but, rather, make the architecture appear more substantial and emphasize the backlighting of the buildings (fig. 41.15). The water in the lower right corner was also repainted. This includes the signature and the boat (for discussion of the signature, see Signature). The texture of the brushwork from the earlier boat remains visible on the surface of the painting (fig. 41.16 and fig. 41.17), and small breaks in the upper paint layers show that the boat was originally painted with a more orangey-brown-toned paint (fig. 41.18). The first boat seems to have been placed slightly to the left and higher or possibly rotated slightly counterclockwise compared with the final boat. The water was reworked when the earlier layers were at least surface dry, and the final boat was thinly painted on top. The reflections of the building and the sky in the lower right corner were added in the final stages of painting (fig. 41.19). The bright-blue, horizontal strokes in the central area of the water were also added as final touches and pass over the left edge of the boat (fig. 41.20).\n\nAll of the reworked areas look somewhat labored and heavy handed. The darker blue and gray strokes applied to the towers near the right edge seem poorly integrated into the surrounding painting (fig. 41.21). Microscopically, it appears that some of these strokes were subsequently retouched with paint that more closely matches the lighter, greenish-blue paint of the building (fig. 41.22, fig. 41.23). It seems, however, that much of this retouching has been removed, probably in past cleaning. Whether the retouching was applied by the artist or as a later restoration is not known. It is also unclear how much has been removed and how extensive the retouching originally was.\n\nIn the final stages of painting, the artist also reworked the edges of the canvas where more of the ground layer had originally been left exposed. It appears that some of the paint mixtures used along the edges contained a red lake that has faded in the more interior parts of the painting but that has maintained its original color along the edges, where it was protected by the frame rebate (fig. 41.24). This has resulted in a narrow band of pinkish-gray paint visible along the left and bottom edges of the painting (fig. 41.25). On the right edge, there is some similar pinkish-gray paint, but it is not as extensive and there is more exposed ground visible along the edge. At the top of the painting, the brushwork from the sky continues to the edge of the canvas, although there is some evidence of the pinkish-gray paint near the left corner.\n\nA very fine, dotted line of blue paint was observed along most of the length of the left and right edges of the composition. The blue paint was identified as Prussian blue and was applied very lightly, mainly depositing on the peaks of the canvas weave to create a broken, rather than continuous, line. It appears to lie between the ground and the paint layers. On the right edge, where the brushwork from the painting is more open and thinly applied, the blue line remains visible intermittently under magnification (fig. 41.26, fig. 41.27). On the left edge, where the painting is more thickly built up, the blue line could not be seen microscopically, but it was visible with the aid of infrared reflectography (fig. 41.28). Both lines appear to conform to the cusping of the canvas, indicating that they were applied before the canvas was mounted on the stretcher.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, strontium yellow, iron oxide (including burnt sienna), vermilion, red lake, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and Prussian blue. UV fluorescence of some of the pale-pink strokes indicates the use of red lake throughout the sky and the water.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1991 and left unvarnished. It has a soft, even sheen. In 1974, a discolored varnish was removed; its origin is unknown (see Conservation History).\n\nIn 1974, a discolored varnish was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and stretched onto a new ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Minimal inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final coating of AYAA.\n\nIn 1991, the synthetic varnish layers and old retouchings were removed. The cleaning revealed a number of very small losses. These were filled and inpainted. The painting was restretched on a new keyable stretcher, over a loose lining fabric. A foam-core backing was attached to the stretcher. The painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and stretched over a loose lining on a keyable stretcher. There are no planar deformations. There is moderate wear and abrasion around the tacking edges. There are several small, localized losses throughout the painting with associated retouching. Some tiny flakes of crushed paint are adhered to the surface near the edges; this probably occurred during the lining procedure. Isolated areas of fine cracks are visible throughout the paint surface. The painting is currently unvarnished. There are some starch-paste residues from the lining procedure on the surface of the painting.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches with cabochon centers on a quadrillage bed, leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding, and an independent fillet liner. The frame has both water and oil gilding. The liner was probably regilded. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the cast foliate on the ogee and sight molding, and the scotia sides. Red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The frame has an overall bronze tone with an even, darkening wash, on top of which casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes and dark flecking were applied. The regilded liner was left without a toning layer. The frame has a glued poplar substrate with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized, running undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 41.29).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by [unknown] to Rosenberg, Paris, by Oct. 10, 1916.\n\nSold by Rosenberg, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Oct. 10, 1916, for 22,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Nov. 6 or Dec. 4, 1916.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPLM and XRF analysis indicate that the paint mixture contains iron oxide red-brown (burnt sienna) and traces of red lake, lead white, vermilion, viridian, and chrome yellow. See Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 22, 2013 and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Parl\\_33\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 6, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Houses of Parliament, London, 1900\u20131901(W1600/1933.1164),\u201d Jan. 2011.\n\nThese observations suggest that cusping on the left, right, and bottom edges is secondary cusping, related to the mounting of the canvas on the original stretcher. The cusping on the top edge could be a combination of primary cusping (related to the stretching of the larger canvas, from which this canvas was cut, on the commercial priming frame) and secondary cusping.\n\nThe holes are difficult to see because of local fills and retouching around the edges. It is possible that additional holes are present but are now obscured by the fills and retouching.\n\nThe construction, patina, and labels (including Durand-Ruel gallery labels; see (Labels and Inscriptions) suggest that the stretcher may have been original or was added early in the painting\u2019s lifetime.\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer was difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 6, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 22, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Parl\\_33\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. June 6, 2014\n\nThe texture of the underlying brushwork suggests that the earlier boat was painted wet-in-wet with the water. This, combined with the observation that the earlier composition was signed while the painting was still wet (see Signature), may suggest a fairly rapid execution of the first painting.\n\nThis painting may be an example of what Monet was describing when he commented on his London paintings: \u201c\u2018I have worked and reworked some canvases as many as twenty times,\u2019 he complained, \u2018spoiling them as I went and ending up redoing them as a sketch anyway in double quick-time.\u2019\u201d Quoted in Paul Hayes Tucker, \u201cThe Revolution in the Garden: Monet in the Twentieth Century,\u201d in Paul Hayes Tucker with George T. M. Shackelford and MaryAnne Stevens, Monet in the 20th Century, exh. cat. (Royal Academy of Arts, London, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/ Yale University Press, 1998), p. 27.\n\nSimilar retouching residues were observed in the sky at the upper right edge.\n\nThe presence of red lake in the faded area has not been confirmed scientifically and is based on microscopic examination of the painting surface. The paint used along the edges appears pale-greenish-gray or pale-pinkish-gray under UV, in contrast to the bright-pink fluorescence that was observed in pink areas throughout the sky and the water. This may indicate that the paint used at the edges contained a different, less stable red lake pigment. The implication of this possibility is that some of the greenish-gray and yellowish-gray strokes in the water near the bottom edge and in the sky along the left edge may originally have had a more pinkish tone.\n\nNo evidence of similar lines was seen along the top or bottom edges.\n\nPrussian blue was identified by SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" June 6, 2014.\n\nThe purpose of these lines is unclear. One possibility is that they are related to the stretching of the canvas, that is, guidelines for cutting the canvas from a larger roll or for positioning the canvas on the stretcher. Similar blue lines were observed on all four edges of Monet\u2019s Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, iron oxide, viridian, cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, PLM, XRF); strontium yellow (PLM, XRF); ultramarine blue, Prussian blue (SEM/EDX, PLM); vermilion, red lake (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. SEM/EDX analysis confirmed that at least one of the red lakes was precipitated on a substrate containing aluminum, phosphorus, and possibly sulfur. PLM analysis indicates that chrome yellow may also be present. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 6, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1164\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 22, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Parl\\_33\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
