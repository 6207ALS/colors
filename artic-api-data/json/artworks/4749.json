    "description": "<p><em>Mrs. George Swinton</em> epitomizes the painterly virtuosity that made John Singer Sargent one of the most fashionable portraitists in late-19th-century Europe and America. Extravagant color and brushwork were central to Sargent\u2019s success, as was his ability to present a refined and appealing image of his sitter. In Elizabeth \u201cElsie\u201d Swinton\u2019s case, he accentuated her regal bearing and feminine dress. Sargent harmonized the realism of her face and body with bursts of impressionistic brushstrokes describing the shimmering, translucent fabric descending from her shoulder. Swinton was also known for her musical talents; at the time her portrait was executed, she was recognized as an amateur singer and later began performing professionally.</p>\n",
