The project\u2019s impetus and funding came from the Getty Foundation. The initial coding and technical implementation was researched and executed by the IMA Lab, a web design and development consultancy of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nWe recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.\n\nWhen you click on text within a paragraph, the citation tool pops up. It generates a citation for that text, in both Chicago or MLA style, as well as a URL, that you can then copy and paste for your own use.\n\nTo cite the entire catalogue:  \nSarah Kelly Oehler, ed., Ivan Albright Paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 2019), https://www.artic.edu/digitalalbright.\n\nTo cite an individual text within the catalogue:  \nKelly Keegan, \u201cMethods behind the Magic: The Materials and Techniques of Ivan Albright,\u201d in Ivan Albright Paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago, ed.
