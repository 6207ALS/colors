    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN: This is a reliquary that contains the tooth of St. John the Baptist.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The reliquary was made around 1400 and formed part of the treasury of an important Catholic church in Braunschweig, Germany.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN: This perfectly complete charming Gothic edifice with two buttresses and then a chapel surmounted by a Christ on top was worked by a Saxon metalworker in Germany. But that central carved rock crystal flask was carved in Egypt around the year 1000, so by the time it made its way to Germany, it would have been considered exotic and precious.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The crystal flask contains the relic wrapped in brown linen, then believed to be the tooth of St. John the Baptist.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN:  The clergy who might have commissioned this piece would have seen that as appropriate and almost in a way as Christianity wrapping itself around Islam is appropriating this piece from the Islamic world and turning it into a prototypical Christian work of art. So taking the power of another religion and harnessing it for Christianity.</p>\n",
