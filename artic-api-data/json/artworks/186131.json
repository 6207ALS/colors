From 1971 to 1983, he and nineteen other adults and their children moved into a six-bedroom home and called themselves a hospital. Three of the adults were physicians. They were continuously open to patients and saw fifteen thousand people over a period of twelve years. Initial doctor/patient interviews were three to four hours long, \u201cso that we could fall in love with each other.\u201d Since no donations were received, nor was there any outside funding, the staff eventually left and the hospital closed.\n\nThis led Adams to his present period of fundraising, which he often does in the guise of a clown. A three-hundred-acre farm has been purchased in West Virginia\u2014chosen because it is the most medically under-served state in the nation\u2014 and two buildings have been constructed. The Dacha/Staff Building was designed by the Yestermorrow Design/Build School of Warren, Vermont.\n\nAmongst numerous other unconventional practices, the hospital will not charge for its services and neither will it carry malpractice insurance. Healing arts such as acupuncture, massage, yoga, herbalism and faith healing will be integrated into patient care. Patients and staff will stay at the hospital, and forty beds will be available for \u201cplumbers, string quartets and anyone wanting a service-oriented vacation,\u201d reflecting Adams\u2019 vision that the health of the individual cannot be separated from the health of the community. Although the free silly hospital is not yet built, the idea of it can and does influence the dialogue on health care delivery systems.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
