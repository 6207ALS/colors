    "description": "<p>For decades Community Associates have enjoyed unique opportunities to hear contemporary artists speak through our annual Guest Artist program. Internationally recognized, multi-media artist Shahzia Sikander will share her pioneering journey of artistic process, discovery and cross-cultural expression in conversation with Madhuvanti Ghose, Alsdorf Associate Curator of Indian, Southeast Asian, Himalayan and Islamic Art&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Pakistan, Sikander received her BFA in 1991 from the National College of Arts, Lahore, Pakistan and her MFA from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1995. Through the many mediums she has mastered, from small, jewel-like paintings to wall-size installations and video montages, Sikander challenges convention by crossing artistic and cultural boundaries such as Hindu and Muslim, East and West, past and present, handicraft and digital.</p><p>Beyond her artwork, Shahzia Sikander has devoted time to teaching and leading graduate seminars nationwide, including the Art Institute of Chicago, the University of Chicago, Northwestern University and University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Sikander\u2019s overview of her expansive body of work is sure to engage, intrigue, and impress.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about Sikander's <a href=\"http://artistproject.metmuseum.org/3/shahzia-sikander/\" target=\"_blank\">artist project at The Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> as well as her own work, <a href=\"https://art21.org/watch/extended-play/shahzia-sikander-the-last-post-short/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Last Post</em></a><em>. </em></p><h3><a href=\"https://sales.artic.edu/Events/Event/18014?date=4/30/2019\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><u>Far North Community Associates\u2014REGISTER</u></strong><u><br></u></a></h3><p><strong>$90 per person</strong></p><p><strong>Schedule</strong><br><strong>9:15 </strong>Bus departs from Adler Park<br><strong>10:45</strong> Arrive at the Art Institute<br><strong>11:00</strong> Guest Artist program begins<br><strong>1:00 </strong>Lunch at The University Club, Chicago<br><strong>2:30</strong> Bus departs for home</p><p>To talk to the event planner, please contact Karen Blair at 1 (847) 650-4464 or <a href=\"mailto:karen.blair@blairjk.com\">karen.blair@blairjk.com</a>.
