    "description": "This volume, the first in a series of scholarly catalogues on the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection, focuses on one of the most important collections of early Italian paintings in the United States. It contains thorough entries on close to one hundred paintings, including an outstanding panel by the Master of the Bigallo Crucifix, a recently rediscovered portrait of Alessandro de\u2019 Medici by Pontormo, and a rare group of Florentine cassone panels. Each painting is accompanied by a detailed description of its physical condition and a critical discussion of earlier scholarship. Written by Christopher Lloyd, Surveyor of the Queen\u2019s Pictures, this catalogue makes a significant contribution to our understanding of one of the finest and least-published collections of early Italian paintings in this country.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.25 x 11.25 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 312</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 175 illus.</li>\n</ul>",
