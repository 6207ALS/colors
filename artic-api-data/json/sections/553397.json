These three small bowls, known as patella cups, were among the most popular shapes at a Roman table in the Julio-Claudian period. We believe that the intensely colored transparent glasses such as the one on the left (cat. 81) were manufactured in the West for Italian taste and that the opaque (cat. 82) and mosaic glass (cat. 83) examples enjoyed a wider market and were produced farther afield in the Roman Empire. These glasswares are in a shape that was well known in ceramics, but the cast glass became more popular and displaced its ceramic competitors. The bowls, with their distinctive carinated profiles, are found in a variety of sizes suggesting vessels for condiments, drinking, and serving.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Three small bowls or patella cups, from left: Bowl or Cup, mid-1st century A.D.
