    "description": "<p>>This performance, created for the Art Institute's Fullerton Hall, orchestrates a loosely gathered collection of international events from 1917: the music of Henry Cowell, a speech by W. E. B. Du Bois, the first film appearance by silent comedian Buster Keaton, the journals of Russian surveyor Vladimir Arsenyev's expeditions east of Siberia, the first appearance of military camouflage as observed by Gertrude Stein, the first poem published by Chilean surrealist Cesar Vallejo, all enacted alongside Constructivist set design and Taylorist industrial laborer-drill choreography. <em>This is not a dream</em> considers performance as a machine to generate echoes between 1917 and 2017, to ask what has and has not changed, and what ghosts of unfulfilled revolutions populate the stage.</p><p>>Can't join us this night? This performance will also take place on <a href=\"/event/performance-every-house-has-door-not-dream\">Sunday, December 3, 7:00pm</a>.  </p><p>><em>This is not a dream</em> has been commissioned by the Art Institute of Chicago and presented on the occasion of the exhibition <em><a href=\"/exhibition/revolutsiia-demonstratsiia-soviet-art-put-test\">Revoliutsiia!
