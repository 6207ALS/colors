They were created as models for the engraved illustrations in a catalogue of the archduke\u2019s collection, which was printed and made available for purchase by the public as the <em>Theatrum Pictorium</em> (Theater of painting) in 1660. A prolific painter of peasant subjects and other everyday scenes, Teniers also served as the archduke\u2019s curator.</p>\n",
