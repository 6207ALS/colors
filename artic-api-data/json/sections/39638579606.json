Harrison Collection, 1948.423  \nKornfeld 56 (monogram), 57 (title block)  \nFor the inside and back, see fig. 108.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin produced nine issues of Le sourire (The Smile), his \u201cserious newspaper,\u201d as well as three supplements; this is the third issue and contained the second of the three supplements. Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897. So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThis single sheet represents only the first and second pages of the October 13, 1899, issue. Before entering the museum\u2019s collection the folio was separated along the central fold and the second leaf (pp. 3\u20134) (see fig. 108.2) and the supplementary leaf (see fig. 108.3) were lost. Originally, the spine edge was the right edge of this extant leaf; the text was read by turning the pages from left to right. This is the second issue containing a supplement, and is the third that Gauguin produced with the hope of using the mimeograph method to print multiples of images as well as the text (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text were rendered partially illegible due to broken lines and uneven printing (fig. 108.4). In later issues of the journal, he turned exclusively to wood-block printing for his illustrations. In the Art Institute\u2019s copy of this issue, only the first page is extant.\n\nGauguin\u2019s lack of success using the Edison mimeograph to reproduce images compelled him to embellish this sheet with the two smallest wood-block prints from the Le sourire series. Here their presence was not an afterthought but was by now predetermined when positioning the text for mimeography. The title block was heavily inked, while a thin application or relatively dry black ink was used for the monogram, yielding a faint impression. The rest of the issue was printed with brownish-black ink applied through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself was responsible for the grainy appearance of the text (see Technical Overview).\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n375 \u00d7 260 mm (sheet); 32 mm (diameter of printed monogram); 24 \u00d7 94 mm (title block)\n\nWhat remains of the issue is in fair condition. At some point it was mended along the edges and central folds. There is some significant staining and discoloration throughout as well as multiple losses in the sheet.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
