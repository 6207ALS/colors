    "description": "<p>Born and trained in Germany, Breuer reacted against the large-format German photography that dominated in his student days, characterized by deadpan subject matter, laborious digital editing, and meticulous printing. He chose by contrast to omit the camera and\u2014in some instances\u2014light as well, instead making marks directly on photographic paper using tools such as sandpaper, drills, shotguns, irons, and razor blades. \u201cI think that photographers tend to find the longest way to the image,\u201d he has said, \u201cand what I am after is the other end of the spectrum, the shortest way, the most direct, immediate interaction with photographic material.\u201d Eroding the paper\u2019s surface, and avoiding all the usual photographic equipment (except for the chemicals needed in development), Breuer creates abstract images tied to his mark-making, and to the presence of the photograph as a physical object.</p>\n",
