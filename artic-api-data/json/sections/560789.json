Robinson, 1949.1208\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Colorless, transparent deep-blue, yellow-green, aquamarine, amethyst, translucent deep-blue, and opaque yellow, white, and brick-red glass. The fragment preserves the bottom or base of a dish or a plate, fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The wall is composed of small segments of flat cane in random patterns. A central band of yellow surrounded by thin bands of white and cased in translucent yellow-green glass; a band of brick red and yellow cased in translucent deep blue surrounded by a thin layer of white. Other elements twist and turn and are less clearly identified, but the colors include transparent deep-blue, yellow-green, and aquamarine glass with colorless glass bands. One colorless cane spirally wound with transparent amethyst and opaque white, yellow, and brick-red glass.\n\nAll edges are broken; the interior is repolished, substantial pitting along the fusion lines of the various band elements. Both sides are heavily pitted and retain patches of light-brown weathering crust with silvery iridescence.\n\nRelated to the more precise ribbon glass bowl fragment (cat. 93), objects with this type of pattern are referred to by David Grose as short strip mosaic vessels. They may have been fabricated from bits and pieces of more complicated ribbon glass vessels.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Grose, Early Ancient Glass, pp. 252\u201353, 297\u201398, nos. 378, 380, or 383 are probably the closest parallels.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 92 Fragment of a Vessel, 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
