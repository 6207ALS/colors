Three figures stand immersed in water to the waist, while two others remain on land. One of the latter crouches on the ground, where the cursory marks used to describe the tufts of grass recall the work of Vincent van Gogh. Another kneeling Tahitian reaches an arm into a large fishing net rendered in small dashes of ink. Their surroundings are verdant\u2014two small pandanus trees stand to the left\u2014although the intense colors Gauguin used originally have faded over time. The work relates to a painting of the same subject in the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin (fig. 40.2 [W 429]), but it does not seem to be a study. Aside from the torso of the leaning woman, whose breasts hang heavily as she stoops to gather the captured fish, the compositions are radically different.\n\nAbove the image in the Art Institute\u2019s watercolor, Gauguin drew a line, creating a space at the top in which he transcribed a poem, \u201cLe ciel\u201d (\u201cThe Sky\u201d), by Paul Verlaine (see fig. 40.3). The verse dates from a period its author spent in prison: in 1873, after shooting (although not seriously injuring) his lover and fellow poet, Arthur Rimbaud, Verlaine received a two-year sentence. The affair caused a scandal; although the victim refused to press charges, the authorities, upon realizing that Verlaine and Rimbaud were partners, prosecuted Verlaine as a practicing homosexual (sodomy was illegal at the time). Some members of the artistic community remained sympathetic to the ostracized poet, however, and his work was published even during his incarceration. In subsequent years, among those drawn to support Verlaine were the writer Charles Morice, who would work with Gauguin on the manuscript of Noa Noa, and the poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, who in 1881 helped to find a publisher for Verlaine\u2019s collection Sagesse (Wisdom), in which the poem Gauguin transcribed made its debut. Friendly with both young Symbolists and drawn particularly to Mallarm\u00e9, Gauguin surely knew the volume, for he quoted another of its poems in an 1891 letter to the poet and critic Andr\u00e9 Fontainas. Accordingly, the appearance of \u201cLe ciel\u201d in the drawing pays homage to Verlaine and to his admirers alike.\n\nThat stylistically the Art Institute\u2019s watercolor seems to belong to the period shortly after Gauguin\u2019s first Tahitian trip is also significant in the context of these interactions. In 1891 Morice and the writer Rachilde (Margu\u00e9rite Vallette-Eymery) had arranged a staging of Verlaine\u2019s 1871 verse play Les uns et les autres (Them and us), to benefit Gauguin, who was at that stage still out of the country. No funds materialized\u2014the director overspent on costumes and scenery, and Gauguin and Verlaine were left disappointed\u2014but the episode could have encouraged the artist to empathize with the poet. Already, both were drawn to sacred and profane themes, which they addressed in their controversial art. Now, additionally, they were let down by friends. Perhaps Gauguin identified with the imprisonment that is the subject of Verlaine\u2019s verse; often in his art and writing the artist cast himself as an exile or outsider. When describing his 1888 Self-Portrait with Portrait of Bernard (fig. 40.4 [W 239, W 2002 309]) to Vincent van Gogh, for instance, he likened himself to Jean Valjean, the outcast hero of Victor Hugo\u2019s Les mis\u00e9rables, \u201cwhom society suppresses, outlaws.\u201d If travel excited Gauguin, arguably, he saw his journeys as in some ways enforced. Notably, in Tahitians Fishing, water takes the place of the sky, the ripples of the water standing in for clouds. There is no roof in this image and there are no heavens beyond its limits.\n\nMore positively, given that Gauguin believed he was unsuited to life in Europe, here Tahiti appears as a place beyond the confines of a stifling urban existence. The pairing of a poem about physical confinement and an open tropical landscape is surprising but perhaps Paris, in metaphorical terms, was his prison, while travel offered a potential release. His choice of a parchment support seems archaic, perhaps a material indication of a desire to \u201creturn\u201d to a supposedly simpler way of life. Written in uneven characters, the words of the transcribed poem are in turn faint and bold, giving the work a romantic, personal character.\n\nAs Linda Goddard noted, Gauguin copied the same lines again in his unpublished manuscript Diverses choses (Various Things) some years later, but there he switched the order of the last two stanzas, changing the emphasis of the poem from the agony of \u201cwasted youth\u201d to the pleasures of \u201csimple, peaceful life.\u201d In Diverses choses, \u201cLe ciel\u201d formed part of a two-page spread: an eclectic collage of words, photographs, and reviews (fig. 40.5). Alongside the poem, he referenced the twelfth-century Cistercian monk Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, with the lines \u201cBeata solitude, sola beatitudo\u201d (Blessed solitude, only blessing). He also included a self-portrait that he attributed misleadingly to his mistress, Pahura (Pao\u2019ura). Goddard argued that Gauguin combined these elements to make a case for his \u201cprimitive\u201d identity\u2014an identity as constructed as any other aspect of his artistic production\u2014and arguably the Art Institute\u2019s drawing operates in a similar way.\n\nIn the same 1899 letter to Fontainas, Gauguin quoted lines from another poem by Verlaine to convey his own disillusionment: \u201cSleep darksome sleep / Doth on me fall / Vain hopes all, sleep / Sleep, yearnings all.\u201d As these words indicate, and as Tahitians Fishing imparts, throughout his career the artist was only too ready to borrow from the works of others\u2014whether visual or literary\u2014in order to better convey a distinctly personal message.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Ambroise Vollard (1867\u20131939), Paris.\n\nRobert von Hirsch (1883\u20131977), Basel, probably by 1943.\n\nSold at Sotheby Parke-Bernet and Company, London, to an unknown collector, June 27, 1978 lot 845.\n\nOffered for sale, Sotheby Parke-Bernet and Company, London, Dec. 2, 1981, lot 182.\n\nSold by Sotheby Parke-Bernet and Company, London, to Alice Adam Ltd., Chicago, as the agent for Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, June 29, 1983, lot 112.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Kunsthalle Basel, Kunstwerke des 19.
