    "copy": " This stunning volume celebrates the May 2009 opening of the largest expansion in the history of the Art Institute of Chicago. The Modern Wing, designed by Renzo Piano\u2014principal of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop\u2014is situated directly opposite Millennium Park and its major feature, Frank Gehry\u2019s celebrated Jay Pritzker Pavilion. In contrast to the pavilion\u2019s brushed stainless-steel ribbons, Piano\u2019s rectangular addition uses Indiana limestone, a double curtain wall of glass, and a \u201cflying carpet\u201d roof cover. The dialogue between these two totally different structures is underscored by Piano\u2019s arresting Nichols Bridgeway, a 620-foot-long elevated walkway that, crossing Monroe Street, connects museum and park.   The biggest of Piano\u2019s art museum buildings to date, the Modern Wing, together with the Art Institute\u2019s existing physical plant, brings the total area of the museum to approximately one million square feet, making it the second largest art institution in the U.S. (the largest being the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).   Of the Modern Wing\u2019s 264,000 total square footage, 65,000 square feet on the second and third floor are devoted to the Art Institute\u2019s outstanding collections of twentieth- and twenty-first-century paintings, sculptures, photographs, film and video, and architectural and design objects. The ground floor includes the two-story-high, block-long \u201cmain street\u201d of the addition, called Griffin Court, as well as a state-of-the-art education center, with classrooms, studios, a resource center for teachers, a children\u2019s bookstore, and more; and a Museum Shop focused on modern and contemporary art and design. The top floor houses a restaurant, Terzo Piano, graced by an outdoor sculpture terrace with views of Millennium Park and the city\u2019s spectacular Michigan Avenue skyline.   James Cuno, Paul Goldberger, and Joseph Rosa, with a photographic portfolio by Judith Turner Architectural photography by Paul Warchol   168 pages, 10 x 11 in. 167 color and 23 duotone ills.
