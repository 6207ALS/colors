    "description": "<p>Art Insights provides enlightening art-enrichment experiences for older members of the community who are unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is pleased to partner with <a href=\"https://www.matherlifeways.com/neighborhood-programs/telephone-topics\" target=\"_blank\">Mather Telephone Topics</a> to provide telephone-based presentations and conversations on a national scale. Mather is a nondenominational, nonprofit organization dedicated to serving older adults. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>This presentation is offered without visuals, emphasizing verbal descriptions of works of art for the benefit of individuals with blindness and low vision.<a href=\"https://zoom.us/j/3863997030\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><br></strong></a></p><p>Enjoy an overview of the special exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/2939/el-greco-ambition-and-defiance\"><em>El Greco: Ambition and Defiance</em></a>. The title aptly describes the personality of the artist Domenikos Theotokopoulos, called El Greco, an ambitious icon painter, who in turn, has become an icon of art. Art Institute volunteer lecturer Dave Williams examines the life of El Greco (1541\u20131614) and his work in view of his late Renaissance influences and his well known capricious character. The results have created a fiery and interesting chapter in art history. This presentation is offered as part of the Art Institute's <a href=\"/lifelonglearning\">Arts Insights</a> program.</p>",
