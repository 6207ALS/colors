    "title": "Apostles of Beauty: Arts and Crafts from Britain to Chicago",
    "description": "One of the most politically progressive and aesthetically compelling artistic movements of modern times, the Arts and Crafts movement sprang from a rebellion against industrial life and mass-produced objects yet eventually united hand and machine in the service of beauty. Through 187 handcrafted, organic works by the movement\u2019s most notable practitioners, Apostles of Beauty traces the movement\u2019s origins in Britain to its blossoming in Chicago\u2019s ripe reform environment. Highlighting a wide range of objects, including ceramics, furniture, metalwork, paintings, photographs, and textiles, the exhibition\u2014the first to explore Arts and Crafts in over three decades\u2014allows visitors the rare opportunity to see the movement unfold in the city where it reached its full manifestation and where many of its treasures still reside.",
