    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: When Edouard Manet made this painting in 1866 it would have appeared radical in every way. To begin with, its subject matter is thoroughly modern. The painting depicts Longchamp racecourse frequented by well-heeled Parisians. To the far left are two fashionable ladies, one with a parasol, and the spectator stands are a mass of black top hats. Rather than painting from a conventional viewpoint among the crowds, Manet chooses a much more daring perspective. He places us right in the racetrack. We can almost hear the thundering horses as the gallop toward us past the finish line, marked by the pole with the circular disk. As part of his effort to capture this specific and thrilling moment Manet conveys movement in a variety of ways. Our sense of the horses\u2019 speed is heightened by the dust clouds around their hooves, and by the sharply converging size of the track from which they seem to burst forth. The dashing horses and jostling crowds are described with swift, often unblended dashes of paint. This revolutionary way of painting later prompted a reviewer to judge the scene as a sketch, but in the lower right corner Manet signed and dated his canvas, signaling that he considered it a finished work.</p>\n",
