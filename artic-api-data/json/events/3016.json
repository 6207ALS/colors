    "description": "<p>Lessons in the Spotlight\u2014Using the Art Critique Process to Strengthen Teaching and Learning</p><p>Artists use the critique process to get feedback about their work, anticipate audience responses, and make adjustments and improvements to their work. While teachers exercise their creativity every day creating lessons and units of study, they rarely get to share their products with peers and other professionals. Whether you are looking for fresh ideas or simply want to support your peers, join us for this lively critique featuring visual art and arts-integrated lessons by selected Chicago area teachers. Using a rubric developed by local education experts, a panel of peer teachers, museum educators, and guest artists will lead the discussion with audience participation.</p><p>Registration is required for this program.</p><p><br></p><p>For additional teacher workshops please visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=&amp;aid=11\" >Teacher Programs calendar</a>. </p><p>If you have any questions or special needs, please call (312) 443-9092 or e-mail teacherworkshops@artic.edu.</p>",
