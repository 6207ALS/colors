Drawing by the light of a gas stove as the daylight failed, Whistler made three attempts to capture the likeness of the stalwart printer. As T. R. Way recounted in his memoir of 1912, the artist abandoned the first drawing (cat. 151), canceling the unfinished image by scribbling over it; the second image (cat. 152) was completed but failed to satisfy Whistler; while the third and final drawing \u201cproved a most excellent portrait.\u201d\n\nDespite its title, Study No. 1: Mr. Thomas Way is the third lithograph in the sequence described by T. R. Way. When Whistler assigned numbers to his lithographs, he generally did so to reflect the order of his preference rather than the order of their execution. Thus, Study No. 1 was so titled because the artist believed it to be the more successful of the two completed portraits. The identity of this lithograph as the third in the sequence was also clarified by T. R. Way in an article of 1913, where he clearly stated that \u201cStudy No. 1 (107), the portrait of Mr. Thomas Way, was the third attempt, the earlier ones being cast aside rather than any alteration tried.\u201d That both the artist and his printers judged this portrait to be the best of the three is further supported by the fact that more impressions of this lithograph were pulled than in the case of the other two images.\n\nIt is worth noting that reduced-size photolithographic reproductions of Study No. 1: Mr. Thomas Way appeared as illustrations in both Th\u00e9odore Duret\u2019s 1904 biography of Whistler and T. R. Way\u2019s memoir of 1912.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory chine (205 \u00d7 127 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (342 \u00d7 242 mm); MWC, grayish white chine (226 \u00d7 162 mm) mounted on white plate paper (379 \u00d7 283 mm).

The existence of a graphite drawing (fig. 152a), virtually identical in composition to the three lithographic portraits of Thomas Way, suggests that in this rare instance Whistler took the time to make a preparatory drawing before beginning to draw on transfer paper. T. R. Way did not mention this drawing in his account.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 153, only state. The Art Institute of Chicago, gift of the Crown Family in honor of James N.
