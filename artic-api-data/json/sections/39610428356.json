Its subject appears to be the setting itself, saturated with color, especially noticeable in the thick, almost tactile, patches in the grove of trees at the left. As the various visual rhymes between the figures and rock formations seem to suggest, nature and its inhabitants exist in absolute harmony.\n\nAt the horizon, to the right, one can see the thatched roof of Gauguin\u2019s hut; a tall, spindly palm tree; and a large mango tree. These elements reoccur in a number of Gauguin\u2019s works, including the wood-block prints Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (fig. 68.2 [cat. 55]) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (fig. 68.3 [cat. 60]), which depict his immediate surroundings in Mataiea, a town in the south of Tahiti. Noticeably absent from Tahitian Landscape is the large Maori idol of Hina, which in the prints appears alongside the group of women dancing in the grove of trees on the left. In a related painting, Nave nave moe (Sacred Spring: Sweet Dreams) (fig. 68.4 [W 512]), the dancers appear in a similar grove of trees in front of a mango tree, and not one but two large statues of the idol tower over them. The absence of these large idols in the Art Institute\u2019s monotype, however, suggests that here religious concerns are secondary.\n\nRather, the landscape appears to be more idyllic, combining Gauguin\u2019s recollections of Brittany, where the artist lived and worked before his first voyage to Tahiti, with those from his more recent travels. With their long black hair, the women gathered in the grove of trees could be Tahitian, but their traditional, long dresses suggest that they could also be from rural Brittany. Notably, the paper for this monotype appears to have been repurposed from a previous sketch of a Breton scene. The verso bears a faint rendering of two figures in what appears to be European clothing\u2014the female figure is on all fours, in a pose that is strikingly similar to that of the bathing figure kneeling on the red fabric (perhaps a pareu) on the recto.\n\nThe work implies unanimity between figure and land\u2014the fine details of a face, a tree branch, or even a specific location seem secondary to the activity of the inhabitants who dance and bathe among the billowing tropical trees. The technique by which Gauguin made this monotype, pulling the impression from an inked piece of glass, lends the image a dreamlike quality. The title for the related painting (Nave nave moe) translates as \u201cdelightful drowsiness,\u201d which reinforces the Edenic character of the scene.\n\nAnother way in which Tahitian Landscape \u201cmakes the familiar strange\u201d is in its restaging of the bather\u2014a typical nineteenth-century French subject\u2014in a Polynesian setting. A woman stands alongside the water\u2019s edge holding a towel, as another bather leans over to wash her hair. Gauguin, like Edgar Degas, employed the monotype to depict the female bather in a decidedly private moment. Fifteen years Degas\u2019s junior, he often visited the older artist\u2019s studio and always admired him. In a sketchbook, Gauguin copied several images of bathers (fig. 68.5) by Degas that he likely saw at an 1888 exhibition (in which he also participated) at Boussod, Valadon et Cie., Paris, a gallery run by Theo van Gogh. The bathing figures on the sketchbook page\u2014Gauguin copied the figure at the center left from Degas\u2019s Kneeling Nude Woman (fig. 68.6), which was on view at the exhibition\u2014appear to be a potential source for the kneeling bather in Tahitian Landscape.\n\nThe work also recalls art historical precedents, adding another dimension to the amalgamation of familiar and unfamiliar at play in the image. The standing woman is reminiscent of a figure in Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Birth of Venus (fig. 68.7), the handmaiden who is poised to cover the goddess as her seashell touches shore. In Le Pouldu, Gauguin pinned to his wall a reproduction of Botticelli\u2019s iconic composition; thus he may well have had the handmaiden in mind when executing the Art Institute\u2019s monotype, producing a highly individual take on the time-honored theme of the bathing Venus.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Ader Picard Tajan at Nouveau H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, to Alice Adam Ltd., Chicago, for Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, Feb. 22, 1984, lot 118.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988; Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988, cat. 202 (ill.); Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, as Gauguin, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Chicago only).\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.

See for example his wood-block print Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), which references a fresco, thought at the time to be by Giotto, of which he had a photograph.

Perhaps the trio dancing in the woods in Tahitian Landscape is related to another of Botticelli\u2019s works, Primavera (1477/82; Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence), in which the Graces dance under a canopy of trees.\n\nAlice Adam Ltd., Chicago, invoice addressed to Edward Blair, Sr., Apr. 2, 1984, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.
