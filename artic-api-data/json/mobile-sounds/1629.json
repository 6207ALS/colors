    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This painting is by the Dutch 17th century artist Jacob Ochtervelt.  Curator Martha Wolff:</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: is one of Ochtervelt's most graceful and delicate pictures, a masterpiece by the artist.  It has great delicacy of light and wonderful communication between the two figures who are engaged in music-making, which can have a moralizing implication of love and temptation and sensual pleasure.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The woman gestures to a passage of music with her violin bow.  Her companion seems about to take up his theorbo, a type of lute.  The intimacy of their connection, conveyed through their exchanged glances, and the interdependent nature of the duet they are about to resume, may also suggest that their relationship is as harmonious as their playing.  The refinement of these people and their setting is suggested by the velvet-covered chair, as well as their expensive musical instruments and elegant clothing, and the large map on the wall reflects the fact that the Dutch were the foremost European cartographers and traders at this time.</p>\n",
