It\u2019s one version of American scene painting. It is typically made up of pastoral visions of agrarian bounty and harmony with the land.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  Wood, who wrote an essay on this topic, thought that the depression was going to force people to leave the cities and come back to the farms. And there would be a rebirth of sort of a Jeffersonian nation of small farmers and shopkeepers. Well, those days were long gone. That just wasn\u2019t going to be the case. We were a completely industrialized country. But he thought that and that\u2019s what he tried to paint. And when you look at some of Wood\u2019s landscape paintings you see that there is, for example, a nineteenth century style plough and this just wasn\u2019t how people were farming anymore.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  There\u2019s thrushers on farms and combines and tractors and none of that is here because what\u2019s celebrated is man\u2019s connection to the land.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  This is not what America looked like in the thirties. It\u2019s what they hoped America would look like eventually.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  However, one painting in this section really stands out for its alternative vision of the American landscape in this period and that\u2019s this painting by Alexandre Hogue.</p>\n<p>&lt;begin audio clip&gt; News clip: Dust once the valuable topsoil of the farm country is not carried in whirling clouds, choking and blinding people and livestock.  &lt;end audio clip&gt;</p>\n",
