S\u00e9bastien Bourdon\u2019s figures wear draperies in the antique fashion, and the setting evokes both ancient Rome and the Christian Holy Land.</p>\n<p>One of the most versatile and successful 17th-century French painters, Bourdon emulated the rigorous classical style of Nicolas Poussin. Bourdon knew Poussin\u2019s work (such as the painting on view in this gallery) from his early years in Rome. Following Poussin\u2019s compositional principles, Bourdon organized this scene as a series of parallel, stage-like registers, resulting in a calm, geometric order.</p>\n",
