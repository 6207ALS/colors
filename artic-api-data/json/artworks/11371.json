    "description": "<p>In <em>Spring Rains</em>, Victor Higgins featured two Native Americans on horseback amidst a sublime landscape. He depicted El Salto Peak ringed with clouds and flooded the valley below with light, creating shimmering atmospheric effects with his vibrant palette. As the artist once observed, \u201cA field or a mountain is always changing. They change size and color with every passing cloud and with the passing of every hour and season.\u201d Higgins studied and taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. He first went to Taos, New Mexico, in 1914, sponsored by a group of Chicagoans who wanted to support local artists. Liberated from financial concerns, Higgins experimented boldly with modern form and color.</p>\n",
