    "transcript": "<p>Paul Cezanne painted this still life, The Basket of Apples, around 1893. The medium is oil on canvas. It is about 2 feet tall by 2 1/2 feet wide. In the painting, a basket of apples spills onto a table set with a bottle and a plate of cookies.</p>\n<p>The table is light brown and tilted at a strange angle. It appears to be a few inches higher on the right side of the painting than on the left. At your left, the basket of apples, propped up by a gray slab, spills out over the table and onto a white cloth. The apples are green, red, and yellow\u2014some with bright, cream-colored highlights. About 20 apples sit inside the basket, and another dozen cover the table, nestled into the folds of the tablecloth. The cloth hangs over the front of the table and hides the uneven edge. A greenish-brown bottle sits at the center of the table and of the painting itself, although it leans slightly to your left. Near the back right corner of the table, there is a plate of beige cookies, which are stacked in a small tower. The painting\u2019s background is a mottled gray, appearing more yellow in some places, more blue in others. Everything in this still life keeps its balance, but in real life, these objects would certainly take a tumble.</p>\n",
