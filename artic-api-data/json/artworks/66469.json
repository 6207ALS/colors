    "description": "<p>The photographer Alfred Stieglitz sought to bring to America examples of the revolutionary developments of modern art in Europe and to provide support as well for progressive artists and photographers who lived and worked in the United States. His New York gallery \u201c291\u201d exhibited work by such artists as Picasso, Matisse, Marin, Hartley, and O'Keeffe, who would become Stieglitz's wife. He photographed her hundreds of times over the years, varying the poses and focusing on parts of her body in a totally modern approach to the portrait. In <em>Georgia O'Keeffe</em>, the subject seems as confident, monumental, and enigmatically beautiful as her works, one of which appears behind her.</p>\n<p>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n",
