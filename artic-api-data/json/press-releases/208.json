Painters sought styles that spoke to European abstraction, realism, populism, labor, urban and rural themes, the new, and the traditional. This summer, the Art Institute of Chicago invites visitors to discover how those artists sought to rethink modernism and forge a new national art and identity, in an exhibition titled America After the Fall: Painting in the 1930s . On view from June 5 to September 18, 2016 in the Abbott Galleries of the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Modern Wing, the show will then travel to the Musee de l\u2019Orangerie in Paris and the Royal Academy in London.   Featuring fifty masterpieces of American painting\u2014including seminal works by Edward Hopper, Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe, Aaron Douglas, Charles Sheeler, Stuart Davis, and others\u2014the exhibition tells the story of the turbulent economic, political, and aesthetic world of the 1930s and how artists in the United States sought to come to terms with the critical question: What is American art? America After the Fall documents not only the artistic milieu of the post-crash depression era, but also the sense of a nation\u2019s fall from grace and the irrevocable changes to the American republican dream.   \u201cThe 1930s began the process of defining the American scene,\u201d says Judith Barter, Field-McCormick Chair and Curator of American Art. \u201cThe exhibition describes the search for \u2018Americanness\u2019 that dominated the work of artists, novelists, and critics through the decade, revealing their preoccupation with national identity as a response to the Great Depression.\u201d   An accompanying catalog, published in partnership with Yale University Press, will further explore these themes with an a lead essay by curator Judith Barter, 140 color illustrations, and additional contributions from: Annelise K. Madsen, Assistant Curator of American Art; Sarah Kelly Oehler, Gilda and Henry Buchbinder Associate Curator of American Art; Sarah L. Burns, professor emerita at Indiana University; and Teresa Carbone, program director for American art, the Henry Luce Foundation.
