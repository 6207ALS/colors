A 1993 offshoot of the paradigmatic Twin Oaks Community, it lies seven miles down the road\u2014or river, which is sometimes canoed. In the early 1990s, a surge of interest in intentional communities saw the population of Twin Oaks outgrow its own infrastructure; in response, Acorn was established on seventy-five beautiful acres of farmland. Membership has fluctuated over the years and currently numbers about thirteen.\n\nAcorn defines itself as \u201ca young community seeking ways of living that are cooperative, caring and ecologically sustainable.\u201d The members work in exchange for coverage of basic needs such as housing and food. The community supports itself with tinnery crafts (rainbow lights, double-hanging candleholders and hanging planters, which can be viewed at www.communitymade.com) and the Southern Exposure Seed Exchange, which is referred to as \u201cour beloved seed business.\u201d Southern Exposure is a company passionately committed to heirloom varieties and \u201copen-pollinated\u201d varieties of vegetables, herbs and flowers. It has taken as its mission the preservation and distribution of rare and endangered plant species and the education of growers and the public about the importance of saving seeds.\n\nSouthern Exposure points out that prior to World War II, vegetables and flowers were grown by farmers who chose and saved seeds suitable for the local microclimate and soil. During the war however, a concerted effort was made to ship food to Europe, and afterward California and Florida became factories for produce that was selected for its ease of shipping, uniform ripeness and ability to perform well in a chemical environment.\n\nSouthern Exposure specializes in heirloom seeds that were chosen over the course of years by local growers, but their efforts are threatened by genetically modified plants. The only way to protect heirloom and rare varieties from being pollinated by GMOs is to keep them distanced from these new creations. Unfortunately, GMOs have a twenty-times greater outcrossing (pollen fertility) rate than non-GMOs; as a consequence, Southern Exposure never knows if its plants grown for seed will be safe.\n\nSo, like Acorn itself, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange is struggling for its existence. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
