    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In a Japanese Buddhist sanctuary four divine guardian figures protect the cardinal directions north, south, east and west. This imposing eleventh century wooden figure represents Bishamonten, guardian of the north, traditionally a source of evil influence. In keeping with his role and position, Bishamonten\u2019s expression is severe and his pose is active and confrontational. His costume is warlike. He wears a helmet and plated armor. This was originally decorated in gold and brightly colored pigments with images of dragons, flowers and patterning. If you look closely, you can still see traces of these decorations on the wooden surface. The figure was once armed with a spear in his right hand which referred to his duty to defend Buddhist law. In his left hand, there was once a small reliquary in the form of a miniature pagoda representing the teachings he protected. Bishamonten is worshipped individually in Japanese Buddhism unlike the other three guardians of the cardinal directions. He is revered as the god of wealth and is one of the seven Japanese gods of good fortune.</p>\n",
