No less than a distillation of my father\u2019s experience resulting from his experiments during many years past. The exact chemical prescriptions (could they be given without seeing the work they are to be used on) would be valueless without the experience\u2014To begin, do you propose to send the stone with drawing over to us to etch and prove? because the liquor with which we prepared the stone before any work is put on, and with which / you would dilute your ink forms an integral part of the whole process as we use it, and would be likely to interfere with the action of any other acid than the one we use for etching. If you should intend to send us the stone, I will send you either some of the chemical or a prescription, and description how to use it, but we have very great fears of the result failing, and then it will be our formula which will have failed although it will have partly been out of our hands. For the etching prescription which as you know is my fathers secret there are three varieties available and their respective use is determined by the actual drawing. It is most tantalizing to find you in the / mood to do this work again and to repeat the triumphs of the Early Morning and the nocturne, and not to be at hand to second you\u2014But even if we gave up all our secrets I dont know how they would help you without the experience\u2014\n\nThe question as to the portrait is\u2014did you, (just before leaving here for Venice) give my father a portrait of yourself drawn by you? It is on brown paper in black and white about 7\" \u00d7 10\" the figure half length leaning over a table drawing with the left hand as if drawn from a looking glass, the face looking straight at you. I think it is your work, he does not. I am sorry to have had to write so unsatifactory / a letter as this but trust we may find a way somehow to do the lithotints.\n\nwith Kindest regards from us both  \nYours very sincerely  \nTom R. Way.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \n[31 October 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I dont seem yet to quite get what I want\u2014but I am convinced that the stump takes perfectly on the German grained paper\u2014The French paper I am not sure of yet\u2014it seems to be intended for pen and ink work\u2014\n\nSoon however I daresay it will come out all right. Indeed I was very near sending you over some one or two things by Mr. Sickert who went to London last night\u2014Now about the / stone\u2014Of course I couldn\u2019t send stones backwards and forwards accross the channel\u2014\n\nWhen I run over to London at any odd time I will do a stone in Wellington Street\u2014and try things with your Father\u2014so after all I may as well wait until then for the mixture\u2014\n\nNaturally I have every sympathy with any ones feeling about their own materials and methods and results\u2014and I certainly would not dream of proposing that your father and you should give away the secrets of the house\u2014so that\u2019s all right!\u2014\n\nAbout the drawing\u2014I dont / remember giving it to your Father\u2014but if I did, it surely must have been by myself!\u2014I think he will know that I am scarcely in the habit of collecting the sketches of my contemporaries!!!!\u2014Besides I know that at one time I always made a drawing before going to bed!\u2014of myself I mean\u2014though I finally destroyed most of them\u2014\n\nI hope his one is not so very bad\u2014though doubtless if I had it here I would pop it in the fire\u2014where I daresay it ought to have gone with the rest!\u2014\n\nPerhaps one of these evenings I shall do another!  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nDoes your Father know anything of the Art Editor of / the Pall Mall Magazine? He wrote and asked me to do them an etching!!\u2014  \n\nBut what an ugly publication!\u2014\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Novr. 3 1893\n\nMy dear Master\n\nThank you for your charming letter. I trust that the time may not be very long before you do come and make a lithotint, for in that not only have your works been quite to your highest pitch, but they remain absolutely alone as none of these other folk have even made a trial with the material. I am sorry you did not let Mr. Sickert bring over the new drawings, but is it too late to send them by post? If you dissaprove of the results they can be taken off the stone as with / The old man in the Chimney corner. And if moreover, they are made on some transfer paper with which we are unacquainted, I should be loth to risk spoiling a drawing with which you were entirely satisfied. I shall venture to send you in a day or two some proofs of sketches I have been making out of doors on the grained paper in stump and chalk, experiments to see how far we could venture to use the stump. Up to the present we have been very successful, although we have made many failures on the way, but I am trying to transfer and print a nocturne made entirely with stump, the difficulty comes in fixing the work into the stone so as to keep the proper gradations, but we shall see. / I am also using the coarser grained transfer paper, and find that the stump hides the coarseness and at the same time transfers stronger.\n\nMr. Rothenstein is making some charming portraits on the paper, he is amazingly clever.\n\nMy Father is quite satisfied about the portrait, it is very good indeed and I cannot understand how he could have doubted that it was your work. That is quite an interesting bit of autobiographical news! your drawing yourself each evening.\n\nWe know nothing of the Pall Mall people at all. It was stated a short time ago that Mr. Astor the American millionaire had bought all the Pall / Mall publications, in which case they ought to pay you a very handsome fee for anything you may do for them.\n\nNow with very kindest regards from my father and myself to Mrs. Whistler and you\n\nI remain\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nTom R. Way.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris  \n[12 November 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014Now I think I have some news for you both!\u2014Monsieur Andr\u00e9 Marty, editor of a couple of journals here is going over to London tomorrow. I enclose prospectus of a work\u2014album or collection of lithographs, etchings, etc. I am asked as you see to contribute\u2014There is as usual no money in the matter for me\u2014or very little!\u2014However as I shall / be in the same box with the others, and as Puvis de Chavannes, Bracquemond, Fantin, and the rest are going to be in it\u2014I have promised\u2014You know that in France it is very much the bad habit in getting up anything to trade on the good nature of the artists!\u2014So in any case as I am going to be amicable, at least let us be very swell among them all!\u2014Therefore I am sending Monsieur Marty to you\u2014He will of course pay you\u2014so you are all right\u2014\n\nNow he will want 100 proofs for his publication, and seven over for the government deposits\u2014In every way I think this will be good business for you\u2014I mean artistically, for attention will be drawn to the fact that I have had my work printed in England by you\u2014In Paris as I make out / there is only one man who prints with intelligence and feeling\u2014and I have just discovered that he is not to be trusted!\u2014More of this by and bye. I should think therefore that a great many will after this work appears send over to you\u2014\n\nTomorrow then M. Marty will take with him three or four, (or more if I have them ready) drawings on the old transfer paper\u2014Now what I want you to do, is put them all on stone and send me the proofs\u2014a couple of each\u2014one on ordinary printing paper\u2014and one on my Dutch\u2014Of course if you can do this at once, I should be delighted\u2014as they are really waiting for my contribution\u2014I shall directly I see the proofs choose the one I let Monsieur Marty have\u2014and then you will transfer that one to a second stone and print it off for his publication\u2014keeping the original stone for me\u2014as you did in the case of the / \u201cWhirlwind\u201d. Of all this, nothing to Marty\u2014Indeed he is in no way to interfere\u2014he is neither to choose nor to bother\u2014You will say if called upon to do so, that you know Mr. Whistler of old\u2014and that he is most fastidious and difficult\u2014and that you have your orders by which alone you can be guided\u2014It will of course, as always, be all for the best, for I mean to give them what I think will appear to our advantage. Meanwhile show nothing to anyone\u2014\n\nNow the Marty business is really after all more of an interruption than anything else\u2014for I am still in the midst of my studies\u2014and had dropped the paper just now for the stone itself\u2014Indeed I have a beauty on stone that I am longing to send you!\u2014I would have given it to Marty tomorrow only it could scarcely be packed in time\u2014Perhaps Mr. Heinemann who is coming here today may take it back with him\u2014I probably might have two or three\u2014The stones are small and light\u2014You ought to sit down and write to me and tell me how I can, with safety, send you over stones now and then if I want\u2014so that they should not be / opened at the customs except in your presence.\n\nWhat a correspondence I am dropping into with you Master Tom to be sure!!\u2014\n\nWith kindest regards and best wishes for the success of all of us  \n\nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Novr. 14 1893  \nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI should have answered your letter yesterday, but waited till this evening hoping to be able to report the result of M. Martins visit. But he has not yet arrived! As soon as he does we will put the matter in hand in just the order you wish, and hurry the first proofs over to you as soon as possible. I have figured up the money mentioned in the advertisment you enclosed, and can see that the editor can have but little to spend on each artists / work; but then, why give so much for so little money? However your proofs shall be very swell indeed! I have been running around all this afternoon to try and find a way to have the stones sent unopened, so far with only disappointing results. Any package under 10 lbs weight could be managed, but that is useless. All parcels, (other than personal luggage) over that weight are examined at Dover. I have been advised to consult Mr. W. Forbes of the Chatham and Dover Co., and will go down to Victoria and see if he can do anything, and will let you know the result. I assure you I am fully alive to the honour in which I am placed through this lengthy correspondence, and treasure / up the letters like the rare gems, they are\u2014My Father is much delighted with your last letter and fully appreciates its compliment.\n\nNow with kindest regards from us both to Mrs. Whistler and yourself\n\nYours very Sincerely\n\nTom. R. Way.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris  \n[15 November 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014Monsieur Marty will I suppose turn up on Thursday\u2014He brings with him five drawings\u2014They don\u2019t really mean anything like what I expect to reach directly\u2014The three little Luxembourg gardens I could have done more with under better conditions\u2014\n\nHowever never mind\u2014let us try them all\u2014The two figures I have a certain hope for\u2014\n\nBut soon some more\u2014and perhaps I may send you over a stone by Mr. Heinemann\u2014before the end of the week.\u2014\n\nYou know you told me they\u2014the \u201cPall Mall Magazine\u201d / belongs to the millionaire Astor\u2014and that I ought to have a big price for anything I might do for them\u2014Now find out for me what are the big prices paid by the bigest publications?\u2014I dont think I should entertain the P.M. Magazine business, because the book itself seemed to me so very vulgar in get up\u2014and is besides so small in size\u2014for a lithograph\u2014But I have had other proposals\u2014say nothing of all this\u2014find out and let me know\u2014\n\nI suppose I shall hear from you tomorrow\u2014By the way you might as well send me your address, so that if a letter goes after post time, you might find it in the evening when you get home\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris\u2014  \n[18 November 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I suppose that Monsieur Marty turned up yesterday\u2014and today perhaps you will have had a stone that Mr. Heinemann took back with him to London\u2014If not, you might send one of the men for it\u2014couldn\u2019t you?\u2014It is you know only round the corner\u201421. Bedford Street\u2014William Heinemann\u2014\n\nI wish you would write me a line by Saturdays post that I might know on Sunday / morning\u2014\n\nI hope the stump on the little figures [cat. 72 and cat. 73] will roll up all right\u2014on the stone I suppose it will all come. I shall send paper today\u2014\n\nFor the French publication you had better find something that will take the place of Dutch paper\u2014and dampen it\u2014I told Mons. Marty that I want each sheet mounted like an etching on some kind of cardboard\u2014no matter how thin\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \n[18 November 1893]\n\nOld letter begun\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I got your letter today just after my note to you had gone\u2014Now this thing of the stump in the sky turning out too dark, or too heavy is astounding!\u2014I was so afraid of it always being too light to roll up at all! However in future all the delecacies I shall certainly require of you tell your Father!!\u2014The least touch of the stump and up you go!\u2014Bravo! what lovely things I shall be doing\u2014I have now two more stones ready for you and a really delightful little drawing on paper\u2014unless / I deceive myself greatly\u2014Very simple and very fair\u2014\n\nI cannot understand the black spots you speak of\u2014unless they may be finger marks outside the drawing\u2014and these are because of the bothering with the stump tablet\u2014Well I am most anxious to see!\u2014\n\nThe sitting figure [cat. 72] ought to turn out well\u2014I do trust she will\u2014How about the lying down one [cat. 73]?\u2014That ought [to] be simple and easy to keep crisp and fair in the printing\u2014  \n\n[unsigned]\n\n[fig. 1]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris\u2014  \nNov 21. [1893]\n\nTuesday eveg\n\nBravo! my dear Tom tell your Father I am enchanted\u2014I don\u2019t know what you mean about the skies being too heavy\u2014I hope fervently that they will stay in the printing throughout exactly as they are\u2014Charming\u2014I think them\u2014Indeed this stump I really believe I am making at last something altogether peculiar\u2014don\u2019t you?\u2014I am getting now a / richness with it\u2014a certain velvety daintiness\u2014quite unlike anything I have ever seen\u2014What does your Father say?\u2014There is a quality about the work now\u2014or beginning to be perhaps\u2014that is quite as fascinating as anything in the etchings\u2014But it is nothing to what I shall get yet!\u2014The little sitting figure [cat. 72] in drapery I am immensely pleased with\u2014don\u2019t you both like it?\u2014Do you see I am getting to use the stump just like a brush\u2014and the work is beginning to have the mystery in execution of a painting\u2014\n\nWell and the lying down figure [cat. 73] is also a great / success\u2014\n\nOf course the stone is a dire failure simply\u2014Now the reason for this is clear to me\u2014In the first place I got hold of by accident a damned piece of chalk called \u201cEstompe\u201d\u2014It must be made almost entirely of varnish\u2014It was as though I were using a stick of candy!\u2014You can see how it has clung fast to the stone in a jerky gluey way\u2014so that the lines are all not only heavy but spotty\u2014and in dots\u2014On the other hand the stump has scarcely taken at all!\u2014so that the whole thing is black against a crude empty unmodeled figure!\u2014I am sorry, for with the colour and tone of it all it looked well\u2014and now we must destroy / the thing at once\u2014No one is to see it\u2014Tell your Father to wipe it off the stone and send me a proof of its destroyed state\u2014and then you might regrain the stone and send it me when you have an occasion\u2014It was very right and wise of you not to have shown this to Marty\u2014and to have discreetly packed the 3 proofs in the box with the new stone\u2014which, by the way, looks most inviting. Thank your Father from me for so nicely sending it\u2014You have, by this, received the new paper\u2014I shall send you more at once\u2014Now I want you to print 12. proofs of each of these last five drawings [cat. 68, cat. 69, cat. 70, cat. 72, and cat. 73] and send them to me as soon as you can\u2014Meanwhile I shall go on working out things\u2014and by and bye we may get into the coloured ones together! The people with whom I was going to print, I told you I have reasons for doubting\u2014\n\nNow about Mons. Marty\u2014I shall send you by Sunday\u2019s / post, the proof of the girl reclining\u2014and if you think you can make the little cleaning safely, Marty shall have that\u2014If there be trouble or risk, well then he shall have the Luxembourg one of the Steps. He is of course anxious about time. The proofs for him are to be mounted on simple card\u2014not too expensively\u2014thinish card I suppose and just hinged at the top corners. Of course more margin at the bottom than at the top. About paper\u2014The white you sent, is rather too white\u2014Can you have his own Japanese?\u2014They ought to be on beautiful paper. The 107 proofs are to be sent here\u2014and the bill / for everything\u2014including carriage etc. to be sent to Monsieur Marty 17. Rue de Rome, I think\u2014though doubtless you have his address\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]  \n\nI shall expect to hear from you\u2014Oh I don\u2019t mean you to trouble about the P.M. Mag. I mean you to find out the highest price they can pay\u2014\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Novr. 27 1893\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler\n\nI received your letter this morning and was very glad to get it, for I had begun to fancy the proofs might have misscarried! I have written to M. Marty this morning asking him to send me some Japaneese paper to print his edition on, as he offered to do, if you should choose that paper (we cant get anything like it!) and I will urge forward the whole matter at once. I see his publication is advertised to be ready in November! 3 days is not excessive for the work / to be got through. I shall not attempt to mount the prints here, it would only make a greater delay and add very greatly to the cost of transit\u2014and he offered to do that, as he has done in another artists work\u2014Your letter came not only as a relief to know that the prints had arrived, but also, I can hardly tell you how glad we were to learn that you were entirely satisfied. Of course my father and I are both very delighted, and fully agree with your ideas as to the \u201cpainter-like\u201d quality of the work. They are superb. I will only venture one word of caution, it is, that at present we are quite uncertain as to the number of prints a / stump drawing will bear, if we can retransfer it successfully it may print 1000\u2019s in the machine but the work is so extremely delicate that the question of retransferring is not quite solved. Any way, any of these drawings should print 200 each without wearing at all, and we shall see what happens in printing M. Marty\u2019s 107. Now with regard to the stone, I regret that your indignation fell so heavily on the harmless necessary \u201cEstompe\u201d! indeed it was no fault of his! You appear to have tried to draw with him! he is to be used on stump\u2019s or pieces of cloth just the same as the bricquette. But you could have \u201cjumped\u201d as heavily as you liked on the grain of the stone! there lay the fault, Just try that stone we sent you\u2014I shall not trouble to send back the stone you sent, unless you especially wish it, as it is not worth graining the corner being broken off makes it impossible to make a pull without marking the paper in a very ugly way. I shall write you again in a day or so, when we are fully at work, and in the meanwhile you might send us the new paper drawing so that it may be put on stone soon, and not get dusty.\n\nwith kindest regards from father and self to Mrs. Whistler and self  \n\nYours sincerely Tom R Way\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \nMonday.  \n[27 November 1893]\n\nDear Tom. Print the little draped figure seated [cat. 72] for Monsieur Marty\u2019s publication\u2014Of course you will keep the stone as it is for my proofs\u2014and he will have another, as in the case of the Whirlwind\u2014\n\nThe lying down figure [cat. 73] dont print at all until further news. I have got I / believe an amazing idea in my head! and will tell you tomorrow!\u2014\n\nMeanwhile go on printing my twelve proofs each of the others [cat. 68, cat. 69, cat. 70, cat. 72, and cat. 73] according to my last letter.\n\nIn great haste\u2014with many things to your Father.  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \n[28 November 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I have sent you by today\u2019s post 40 sheets of beautiful Dutch\u2014and the touched proof of the lying down figure\u2014\n\nThis has nothing to do with Mons. Marty\u2019s publication\u2014for as I wrote you last night you will print for him the seated draped figure [cat. 72]\u2014\n\nNow this is my notion\u2014I want your / Father to take a transfer of the lying down figure as it is on the stone, and put it onto another stone that he will have prepared for painting upon!\n\nSend me the stone packed in a little box like the one I sent by Marty\u2014It will run no risk here, for they tell me they are much accustomed to receiving them at the customs, and if you put on the outside Pierre Lithographique, they are not even likely to open it\u2014Besides put Dessin pas fix\u00e9 Priere avoir Grands Soins\u2014and address to me / 86.Rue Notre Dame des Champs\u2014adding after my name Artiste Peintre\u2014\n\nThen I can with a few touches of the brush make a wonderful thing of it!!\u2014\n\nOf course you will send lump of ink such as I used before and the two little bottles of mixture (marking which for painting and which for washing out) Perhaps they had better come by post\u2014\n\nNow I sent the proof that your Father might see what I am up to Dont show it and send it back to me\u2014 /\n\nMany pleasant things to both of you\u2014  \nIn great haste.  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n[fig. 2]\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Novr. 29 1893\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler\n\nI have received both your note and the new packet of paper and the corrected nude figure [cat. 73]\u2014The 12 sets of the other four drawings are in hand now. But for these alterations you suggest, no! no!! no!!! if the matter were a common coarse commercial affair, we should only say it must be entirely redrawn if these alterations are necessary. But, my master, are they necessary? will not all this mass of dark make / the figure quite weak? Both my father and I find the drawing as it is so charming and delightful that we are staggered at the idea of your altering it in anything like the manner your sketch proposes. It is certain that any such attempt will ruin the drawing. I notice you have painted out a number of touches with white, of course these can be done easily, but not the additions. Do now! do leave this drawing (with these small erasures made) as it is, and have it printed with the others, and make another drawing on the lines of these alterations, you wont regret it later on.\n\nI have not had any paper sent me by M. Marty, to print the seated figure [cat. 72] on, if you should / see him, ask him, please, to send me a line as to whether I am to expect any or no? when I know I can send you something that may answer in place of his, although his would be the best\u2014\n\nWith kindest regards from my Father and me to Mrs. Whistler and yourself\u2014\n\nI remain yours very sincerely  \nTom R. Way.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris  \nThursday eveg.  \n[30 November 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I have but two minutes for tonights post\u2014and nothing but a huge envelope for this scrap!\u2014So no time now for more than to say all right\u2014go on and print the 12 of the little lying down figure as it is\u2014and therefore I dont think you need alter anything\u2014except to clean off the extra line of the outer gown that / crosses the sofa straight down. You will see the white paint over it in proof\u2014\n\nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly]  \n\nHave written to Marty telling him that he is keeping you waiting!\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Novr. 30 1893\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler  \n\nYou will doubtless have received my rash communication of last evening, and I must apologize for not having waited until I got definite instructions on the subject of the alteration. Still my present letter must needs be much on the same lines, and for the following reasons. You ask us to make a transfer on to a stone prepared for wash\u2014Such stones are grained and it is only possible to transfer the strongest and coarsest work to a grained stone, with this drawing / you would get a few of the darkest lines, broken, and some few patches of tone where the stump is strongest the rest would not appear at all\u2014But let us suppose that this is done, and that there is a fairly satisfactory result on the stone\u2014you then add your wash\u2014It must then be etched or the wash will roll up solid all over. But the etching that will keep the proper gradations in the wash, will quite clear away work that has been transferred, and which has no strength to stand anything but the most tender treatment. But if you really must modify this drawing, may I suggest that you do it with a second printing? I can send you some grained / Transparent transfer paper, which you can lay over an impression and make your drawing on\u2014we can then fit it to its place and print it in black so that you would get your effect quite satisfactorily without risking the original drawing in any way\u2014Of course we will avail ourselves of the method you suggest of sending you the stones, and you can perhaps contrive to send them back in charge of friends who may be crossing.\n\nIf you will let me know what course you would like to adopt in this drawing, I will send you the materials and the drawing you sent by return, but please say if I shall make the little erasures on the original stone from this copy before returning it to you\u2014\n\nOh! if one only lived near at hand to explain in a few minutes all these \u201cwhys and wherefores\u201d! with kindest regards from my father and self.\n\nYours very sincerely  \nTom.

I have also sent you two extra impressions which will explain themselves. I should like you to look at the paper on which the seated figure [cat. 72] is printed\u2014it gives a very good impression and is almost as silky as a Jap paper. We can get any quantity of it, some stouter than this sheet. I find the stump work, once on the stone, has a constant tendency / to increase in tone, and requires very careful watching to keep it to its proper strength\u2014I have now got Mr. Marty\u2019s paper, and his prints are nearly finished, we may forward them tomorrow evening. A funny incident occurred, last week. My father went into the print shop in Green St. Leicester Sqr. to the successors of Thibadeau to enquire about one of your etchings in their window, seeing him generally interested in your work, they wanted to know if he were interested in the lithographs? if so, would like to shew him some, as yet, not shewn to anyone in London at all! much surprised of course! but would be very pleased to see.\u2014a set of / these last five! You did not loose much time! But it was funny they should have dropped on him! wasn\u2019t it? Pretty well every other dealer in town knows him by sight. Of course he did not let on at all!\n\nTrusting you will find these sets all right, and with kindest regards from us both to Mrs. Whistler and yourself.\n\nI remain  \nYours very Sincerely  \nTom. R. Way\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Decr. 5 1893\n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI have posted to you M. Marty\u2019s 107 prints\u2014tonight. I trust you will like them. I find that there is no difference at all between the first and the last of the pulls. Now I will tell you that we have printed them all from the original stone, but\u2014we have taken the liberty of putting a small imprint on his proofs / which can now be taken off the stone and you may have another hundred printed on your own paper, and I will guarrantee no person at all will be aware that they have not all been pulled before these 107; they will only know that a certain number have an imprint on them\u2014judge for yourself when you open the packet, I cannot tell you which is the begining or which the end, but see if you can tell? I will send you the transfer paper and instructions when / sending the Brittany proofs\u2014\n\nI have seen Mr. White of the \u201cStudio\u201d today and in the course of conversation I asked him about the P.M. Mag, and learnt the following. That it does belong to Astor and that they are paying high prices for \u201cStar\u201d work, at anyrate in the matter of writing, but what actual figure for any drawing he could not say. But \u201cHarper\u2019s\u201d magazine pays \u00a310 for a single drawing (full page) as a frontispiece etc. I do not, of course know what it is the P.M.M. want from you, whether etching or lithograph or what, but perhaps you can get at some result from this information. They want your work and can afford to pay for it.

Paris.  \n[11 December 1893]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014The Brittany proofs have come\u2014and they are capital\u2014Only there is one thing\u2014when you find in the sheets I send you, a defective one\u2014either too spotted with mildew\u2014or wormeaten\u2014don\u2019t use it. This time there are a couple with a tiny hole in each\u2014Those sort of sheets I can take back one of these days, to do for smaller etchings\u2014for all Dutch paper is getting awfully rare\u2014The specimen proof you sent on some curious paper that you say you can get, I don\u2019t / really much like as far as the paper itself goes\u2014It is a little too coloured\u2014too dark\u2014That Japanese of Mons. Marty\u2019s was really wonderful\u2014Hand made\u2014Does your Father think we could ever get any?\u2014Your little imprint, by the way, is very delicate and well placed<sup></sup>\u2014Ilike it\u2014moreover it will just make the distinction between this publication and the proofs\u2014so that\u2019s all right\u2014\n\nYour letter was very nice my dear Tom\u2014and now about Gleeson White and the Studio\u2014It strikes me that he might have the second drawing I did from my sister in law\u2014you know the one standing with the pair of gloves drawn out in the two hands\u2014The first, seated, was published in the \u201cWhirlwind\u201d\u2014but this second has not I believe been published at all\u2014You will / of course know. The \u201cAlbemarle\u201d had I think, the rag shop Chelsea. Anything else? I dont remember\u2014You might send me the list\u2014You know I had several destroyed. Now among them did I destroy a little draped figure of a girl standing reading a letter? I rather hope not\u2014for I have a proof that I now think well of!\u2014\n\nDo you remember? Something like this [fig. 3]. I have not the drawing by me\u2014If you have the stone, I wish you would print me a dozen proofs, and send them on\u2014\n\nAlso I should like half a dozen beautiful pulls of the dancing girl [cat. 29]\u2014and half a dozen of the little nude figure resting holding a cup of tea\u2014\n\nNow in printing, I think that some of the sheets are perhaps too big\u2014The pretty size is the smaller Dutch\u2014and print always a little higher up in the paper than down\u2014Among the / lying down figure [cat. 73] of these last is one with rather more margin at the bottom than the others\u2014and you have no idea how much daintier she looks!\u2014\n\nAnother little thing to notice is that when the sheet has a cut edge and a rough one, I would always put the straight cut edge at the top. [fig. 4] Also when, as is often the case, there are written figures\u2014numbers\u2014in the corner of the page, tell your printer to be careful to choose the other side of the paper for his impression\u2014\n\nOf course if any of these things be published\u2014Gleeson White\u2014or others\u2014we will proceed as in the case of the Whirlwind. I mean as to the printing\u2014transferring to other stone etc\u2014otherwise I give no more away\u2014so I must know what any of these Gentlemen propose to pay me\u2014\n\nI am off now\u2014  \nSo Adieu for the time\u2014  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Decr. 13 1893\n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI am sorry that you should find anything to complain of in the proofs, I will remember the instructions in future. You bid me select from the paper you send us to pull the proofs on! I fear you will not get many impressions as I should have rejected at least half the last two lots you sent. The few on smaller and whiter paper, were sheet I had over from a long time ago! and the big sheets were the last you sent. I have still a few (5 or 6) of them left, but they are dreadfully stained and mildewed. We / have not received the packet you have spoken of as sending, and have nothing to pull these new proofs on. I dont think it possible to get any like the Marty paper. Old Chineese is, I suppose, too white for you? I will make a pull amongst the others for you too see how you like it, the impression is perfect\u2014\n\nI have enquired at M. [glossary:Deprez and Gutenkust] the price of the lithographs\u2014they ask \u00a33.3.0 each for the Luxembourg [cat. 68, cat. 69, and cat. 70] and the nude [cat. 73], and \u00a34.4.0. for the draped seated figure [cat. 72]. Of course they show them as great treasures\u2014You told us to take off the reading figure [cat. 32] long since but we protested, and so it was left on and you can have your proofs, also the dancing girl [cat. 29] and the nude leaning against the chest of drawers and reading [cat. 33]. / That I suppose is the one you mean, by the \u201clittle nude girl resting and holding a cup of tea\u201d.\n\nThe drawings so far used for periodicals are the \u201cSeated figure\u201d [cat. 34] (of your sister in law) \u201cThe blacksmith\u2019s forge\u201d (with hoop) [cat. 36] and \u201cThe fish shop\u201d [cat. 37] for the Whirlwind and \u201cthe rag shop\u201d [cat. 26] only for The Albemarle. I should think that the Studio people will be delighted with the \u201cGants de Su\u00eade\u201d, it is a charming drawing and can be treated just in the same way as the Whirlwind i.e:\u2014transferred. I will shew Mr. White that part of your letter which refers to the subject. As you are coming over so soon, at least I hope so from your letters, I dont want to miss you as I did last time, by staying at home with a cold! so please let us have a little word as to when you will be over, so we may be all the time at home ready for you when you do come\u2014also I would have a stone or two ready if there were any likelihood of you being able to use them whilst here? with kindest regards, and awaiting that paper, I remain yours very sincerely  \n\nTom R.

My dear Tom\u2014I find no fault with the proofs!\u2014I only meant to point out that the printer might be directed in a way\u2014so that he should not print on the same side with numbers on the page\u2014avoid sheets with worm holes and place the impression a little higher than low on the paper\u2014Voila tout! The proofs, the printing and the care taken could not be / more perfect, and no one could more thoroughly appreciate all that you and your Father are doing\u2014\n\nNow we sent you yesterday some more paper and more is going\u2014Wherefore print the sets of Brittany I spoke of, and of the others, say\u20144 of the reading girl draped\u2014(The one that happily you saved)\u20144. of the nude model reading, 6 of the dancing girl\u20144 of \u201cThe winged hat\u201d that is Miss Philip seated.\n\nNow\u2014Thomson of the Art Journal (Goupils) / would do with the one of the Luxembourg Gardens that I call \u201cConversation under the Statue\u201d, for his magazine\u2014I know what you told me about the stump work\u2014and if you think this would work up too much\u2014there is little of it in this particular drawing, (but very dainty what there is of it, wherefore I would not have it spoiled)\u2014and if you find that this can safely be transferred, then you might print it for him\u2014and of course he would pay you\u2014But I must not lose it\u2014Therefore if it wont transfer I must do him something else\u2014that\u2019s all\u2014\n\nAll right my dear Tom\u2014I will let / you know in time before we come over\u2014and you shall have the stones ready for me and that will be delightful!\u2014\n\nNow I am hard at work in the studio\u2014which accounts for this pencil\u2014\n\nMany things to your Father and yourself\u2014and get me off the beautiful proofs\u2014\n\nAlways\n\n[signed with a butterfly]  \n\nWrite me about Thomson\u2014  \n\nAll right then about Gleeson White\u2014I had better write him\u2014\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Decr. 23rd 1893.\n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI send you the proofs of six of the drawings, I have quite used up the dutch paper, and even with the last lot you sent we had to turn out three sheets which shewed the mildew all over directly they were damped. (You can have all these bad sheets whenever you like as I have kept them all!). Will you please be kind enough to let us know the full number you can use at one time? as with these Brittany / we sent you 4 sets on Decr. 5 and very soon after you ask for 5 sets more. Now the expense and time of pulling 9 or 10 sets is very little more than pulling 4! and the risk of injuring the stones infinitely less! When I get the rest of the paper I will send you the ballance. Will you look at the old Chineese paper pulls? and tell me what you think of it? I am sorry that the result of transferring the Luxembourg drawing [cat. 69] was no better, but it is almost as good as one could expect, seing how extremely delicate and soft the stump work is\u2014Is there not one of the old drawings which will do for the Art Journal? / I have put into the packet a couple of pulls of an experiment in stump on stone of mine [fig. 5];\u2014they may suggest possibilities to you.

It seems to be sort of hand made business\u2014as if you had pasted together two or more sheets\u2014after the manner of the Jappanese stuff of Monsieur Marty\u2019s\u2014Have you heard from him? He was enchanted with his proofs\u2014He came here and took them away after I had signed them\u2014but I have heard no more of him since.\n\nThe transfer of the Luxembourg [cat. 69] I thought, upon the whole, perhaps a little coarse, as you had forseen\u2014I mean that I had better appear with something else to / greater advantage in the Art Journal\u2014and so I had better draw something with the chalk alone\u2014for it is as you say evident that the stump can only do itself justice in the hand printing of proofs\u2014\n\nAbout the \u201cStudio\u201d\u2014You had better as you proposed, show the \u201cGants de Su\u00e8de\u201d to Mr. Gleeson White and tell him that is what I propose for his magazine\u2014Also you might ask him what they would be prepared to pay me the use of the work for one of [their] numbers.

Now if you agree to this, I will see that the impressions for the magazine are all good, as we have previously done in the Whirlwind and moreover these 50 proofs, which I should suggest should be mounted, india on plate paper, <strike>can be printed from a transferred stone</strike>. What do you say?\n\nI have received a second installment of Dutch paper, so have a good stock in hand for you. Mr. White was asking when your drawing for the Art Journal was likely to appear, as it is advisable that two should not come out in the same month, perhaps you would tell me something about it when you write.

[1894]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014Many thanks for your letter\u2014You may say to Mr. Gleeson White, with my compliments, that I am pleased at their liking the \u201cGants de Suede\u201d\u2014and that I am willing to let them have the use of the stone, as understood by yourselves, for \u201cThe Studio\u201d (for one number) for 10 gs. This for the strict publication only\u2014The proprietor and editor are not to have one single proof or print beyond those you print in their publication \u201cThe Studio\u201d\u2014certainly not!!\u2014\n\nSuch a proposition was / surely never heard of!\u2014\n\nNo one has hitherto certainly ever dreamed of making it to me!\u2014\n\nI believe that Mr. Gleeson White cannot have understood its astounding audacity\u2014and, on the part of Mr. Holmes himself, it could only have been thoughtless na\u00efvet\u00e9\u2014and not the dazzling bit of \u201ctry on\u201d it really looks like\u2014and that amounts to genius!!\u2014\n\nTell them, from me, to reflect upon their suggestion\u2014: deliberately that I should give them, at their own calculation, fifty guineas, for ten pounds!! over and above all the chances of profit or artistic interest that should accrue to their magazine because of the presence in it of the drawing itself.\u2014Chances that Mr. Gleeson / White, in his first letter to me, most assuredly thought good enough to induce him to write it, asking for a work, and proposing to pay for it\u2014\n\nYou don\u2019t suppose, do you, that Mr. Thomson has bethought himself of such brilliant business as this? for his Art Journal?\u2014\n\nIf Mr. White and Mr. Holmes are under such impression, you had better tell them, from me, that if Mr. Thomson could ever, by any unwonted influence of his present Editorship upon his charming nature, have harboured, for a fleeting instant, in the uttermost parts of his journalistic mind, such a thought, he would, I know, have hastily thrust it from him, rather than run the risk of its utterance, in an unguarded moment, before me!\u2014\n\nHowever I daresay after all, with these gentlemen, it is as the doctor would say, \u201cbetter out than in\u201d\u2014and now we can go on all right!\u2014/\n\nIf then they would still like to have the \u201cGants de Su\u00e8de\u201d for the one number of \u201cThe Studio\u201d under these clearly made out conditions, why then my dear Tom ask Mr. Gleeson White kindly to write me a little letter of acceptance, and Mr. Holmes can send me a cheque, and you can fire away and print the lithograph at once\u2014\n\nThere is nothing as yet ready for the Art Journal\u2014so that Mr. Thomson will have to wait\u2014at any rate he couldn\u2019t well have it for next month\u2014so Mr. White need not be afraid if he were to put mine in \u201cThe Studio\u201d for Feb.\n\nwith kindest regards to your Father and yourself,\n\nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly] /\n\nPrivate\n\nNow Tom you do exactly as I tell you!\u2014Take the enclosed letter, after reading it to your Father, round to Mr. Gleeson White yourself\u2014and say to him: \u201cI have had Mr. Whistler\u2019s answer to your proposal, and I think the best way is to give you his letter\u2014to read yourself and to show to Mr. Holmes\u201d\u2014\n\nThen let him have the letter\u2014and see how he and his proprietor like it\u2014\n\nMake him give you back the letter afterwards Tom\u2014you might like to keep it as a rare instance of business perception in an artist!\u2014You ought to show it to the doctor\u2014  \n\n[unsigned]\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Jany 15th 1894\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler\n\nI have just seen Mr. White and learnt from him that he will write to you and send you the cheque direct. He offered it to me to send, but I thought it better he should send it himself. And now let me ask you to entirely dis-associate Mr. Geeson White from any suggestion in the transaction, beyond the one definite idea of admiration for you and your work and consequent anxiety if possible to obtain something for the magazine of which he is the editor. He has acted entirely and / solely as a mouthpiece, and has expressed himself more than once of his dislike of his position as such. He having his knowledge of the real value of your work, whilst his proprietor has his ideas of the necessity of keeping the strings of the money bags tight! No, I fear that I am so far criminal in having suggested the idea of proofs when I took them an impression to show but I certainly thought that an offer would have been made of a certain part of the receipt from any sale of proofs and which would have made the return to you so much the more, but I have not made any suggestion of terms at all. You magnify the enormity of the \u201ctry on\u201d if it can be called such, far beyond / its capacity. The Studio being sold, like all magazines through shops and agents has to allow all such 33 1/3% and art dealers ask for 50%. and Mr. White has said that they would have to allow to their agents at least 33 1/3 off each proof ordered through them, besides paying the cost of production. Still I quite allow, and agree with you that to ask you for the proofs in addition to the magazine prints for the 10 gns was alltogether monstrous, and you will understand that in putting the offer before you, I, like Mr. White, simply acted as a go between! and I felt it best to offer no opinion but tell you what was told me\u2014\n\nNow, will you please be kind enough, as soon as you have the money to send me a little note of advice to say we may proceed with printing as you have arranged.\n\nSo with kindest regards to Mrs. Whistler and Yourself\n\nI remain yours very Sincerely  \nTom.

(small size) and I will get them in hand at once for you. I am not quite certain as to two of the landscapes. The catalogue describes them simply as, \u201csix original lithographs\u201d. As I remember them they are. 1. \u201cThe nude reclining\u201d. 2 \u201cthe seated draped figure\u201d 3 \u201cThe dancing girl\u201d\u20144. \u201cHouse tops, Brittany (with water)\u201d 5 \u201cLuxembourg Gardens, the steps\u201d. 6\u2014?\u2014I know it was one of the Luxembourg drawings but which neither my father nor I can remember\u2014Will you kindly say when you send the paper?\n\nI wrote to Mr. Whistler last night asking him as to the probable date of the Art Journal drawing? To day I learn that I have to go to / Cromer to make some sketches on Monday and shall not be back for a few days, consequently may I ask as a great personal favour if he will let me know by Sunday night\u2019s post so I may have it (only a postcard) by Monday morning? We are to have definite instructions to print for the Studio on that day, and as they go to press for their February number too then, they I know would like to announce their date in this next number\u2014Their issue is not likely to affect the Art Journal at all; but if the Art. J. is issuing before them they will loose all the good the great rarity of such work will do for them\u2014\n\nWith kindest regards from my father and self to Mr. Whistler and yourself\n\nI remain  \nYours very sincerely  \nTom.

Virtue are not pleased that <strike>the printing should be done by Mr. Way absolutely as before</strike>, Mr. Way should do for them the printing absolutely as he did before, I am afraid that it all falls to the ground\u2014and that is the end of that!\u201d\u2014\n\nIn short I said that \u201cit is entirely to him (your Father) that is due the revival of artistic lithography in England\u201d\u2014and that \u201cas far as I am concerned I certainly owe all the encouragement I may have received in my work, to his exquisite / interpretation\u201d\u2014\n\nMuch more than all this I said\u2014the upshot being that most decidedly I should not dream of allowing anything of mine to be treated by anyone else but Mr. Way\u2014To say nothing of his being one of my oldest and best friends and that it was not likely that I should mortify him by taking out of his hands the work to which he has given such tender care\u2014\n\nOf all this is not little Thomson\u2019s doing\u2014but the Virtue people\u2014for Thomson is a very good fellow and would n\u2019t like to offend me by any such proposal\u2014\n\nHowever that\u2019s all right\u2014My instructions to you / with reference to the Art Journal remain unaltered\u2014and Messrs.

McN Whistler Esqre.\n\nGUL W97. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on four sides.\n\nSee letter 49. T. R. Way was careful to reply to Whistler\u2019s request for details in only general terms, thus preserving the secrets of his father\u2019s process. Whistler asked Way again for materials for working in lithotint in November, but with no more success; letter 61, letter 62, and letter 64. Regarding Whistler\u2019s requests, Way wrote: \u201cMy father felt that he could help him best by continuing on the old lines, as his many years\u2019 knowledge of the varying ways in which it is necessary to treat drawings of different characters could not be communicated in a few hours\u2019\u2014or even days\u2019\u2014instruction\u201d; Way (1912), p. 103. Whistler wanted T. R. Way to come to Paris to discuss the subject of printing and to set up a press so that Whistler could do his own printing, but both Ways, father and son, thought that this would involve a great deal of wasted time and effort, and would distract the artist too much from his painting; Way (1912), pp. 102\u201304.\n\nThis description fits Portrait of the Artist (M 683), a black and white chalk drawing on brown paper in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.

Apart from William Rothenstein, they probably included Robert Anning Bell, Charles Edward Holloway, Mortimer Menpes, Frank Short, and Charles J. Watson, all of whom drew with crayon on transfer paper and had their original lithographs published in The Studio in 1894 and 1895; see The Studio 3, nos. 14\u201317 (May\u2013August 1894), and The Studio 4, no. 24 (March 1895); see also letter 42 n. 160 and letter 74.\n\nThe Fireplace (cat. 61); see letter 42 n. 159.\n\nT. R. Way\u2019s first transfer lithographs were drawn on the coarse-grained German transfer paper and dated 1893, and were among the subjects he included in his Religues of Old London (London, 1896). Several of his early lithographs, such as those of Wych Street, Drury Lane, the church of St. Bartholomew the Great, and Cloth Fair, reproduce etchings or lithographs Whistler made in the 1880s; Smale (1987), p. 22.

Whistler\u2019s lithograph The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) was published in Album IV of L\u2019Estampe originale, under the title Danseuse. Other artists whose works appeared in the same album were F\u00e9licien Rops, Pierre Roche, Benjamin Jean Pierre Henri Rivi\u00e8re, Pierre Auguste Renoir, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Henri Jules Charles Corneille de Groux, Jules Ch\u00e9ret, Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re, and F\u00e9lix Bracquemond. A number of British artists contributed to subsequent albums: Charles Ricketts (Album VII, 1894), Charles Hazelwood Shannon (Album VII, 1894), Joseph Pennell (Album VIII, 1894), William Rothenstein (Album VIII, 1894), and Walter Crane (Album IX, 1895); see Donna M. Stein and Donald H. Karshan, \u201cL\u2019Estampe Originale\u201d: A Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9, exh. cat., (New York: Museum of Graphic Art, 1970).

Whistler was upset that Belfond had sold a proof of a color lithograph (Draped Figure, Reclining, [cat. 56]) he had presented to him; Whistler to [glossary:Kennedy], [10 December 1893], NYPL I/45. A proof signed in pencil and inscribed \u00e0 Monsieur Belfond is in the collection of Steven Louis Block, Washington, D.C; Hobbs and Spink (1982), p. 61, no. 43. A year later Whistler reported that the printing firm had \u201cbroken up, and gone to the dogs!!!\u201d; letter 127.\n\nWhistler sent cat. 68, cat. 69, cat. 72, cat. 73, and probably cat. 70; letter 55.\n\nIn November and December 1893 Whistler worked on a number of stones, some of which were acquired in Paris and others from Way in London. This was probably the stone Whistler sent to London via William Heinemann, which failed to print satisfactorily; see letter 54 n. 24.\n\nJ. McN. Whistler Esqre.\n\nGUL W99. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on three sides.\n\nUndoubtedly Andr\u00e9 Marty; see letter 53.\n\nA number of letters (letter 53, letter 55, letter 56, letter 57, letter 58, letter 59, letter 61, and letter 69) refer to Whistler\u2019s work on stones during late 1893. Some stones either obtained by Whistler in Paris or sent by Way from London were carried to and fro by William Heinemann and Andr\u00e9 Marty; see letter 55, letter 56, and letter 61. The failure of a drawing to print from one such stone was blamed on the quality of the stone supplied by Whistler, but Whistler believed the drawing materials were the cause of the problem; Way (1912), p. 93; letter 58. There was a danger of the stones being broken or the drawings damaged if Whistler sent them via parcel post; a number of his Venice etchings had been destroyed in July 1892 when a customs official pierced the contents of the parcel; Huish to Whistler, 1 July 1892, GUL F180. The identity of the drawings Whistler made on stone during this period is not certain. However, Draped Model, Standing (cat. 74) and Draped Model, Standing by Sofa (cat. 75), neither of which was recorded by Way (both images were printed only posthumously), were probably executed in November or December 1893. Despite his interest in transfer paper, Whistler valued the stone and still hoped to make lithographs on stone in August 1894; letter 107.\n\nFGA 104. Single sheet, written on two sides; addressed envelope. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 5 Nov. 93.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas Way. Junr. / 21.

R. Way had lived at 43 Upper Berkeley Street, Marylebone. A year later he moved to 50 Upper George Street, Marylebone, and in 1900 to 110 Regent\u2019s Park Road, Hampstead.\n\nFGA 106.

Single sheet, written on two sides. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 23 Novr 93.\n\nLetter 56 was postmarked 18 November 1893, and was probably the \u201cnote\u201d to which Whistler refers at the beginning of this letter. Since he had just posted letter 56 when Way\u2019s letter (unfortunately missing) arrived, it seems likely that Whistler wrote the present letter on November 18, soon after he had posted his first letter to Way. Rosalind Birnie Philip recorded letter 57 as having an envelope (see GUL LB5/32), but it is not catalogued with an envelope in the Freer Gallery of Art Archives. The envelope described by Birnie Philip is instead catalogued with letter 58. It seems most likely that letter 57 and letter 58 were originally posted in the same envelope but not sent until 25 November 1893 (postmarked date). See letter 58 n. 35.\n\nRegarding Whistler\u2019s new work on stones in Paris, see letter 54 n. 24. The new transfer drawing was probably Little Draped Figure, Leaning (cat. 76).\n\nFGA 107. Folded sheet, written on all sides; addressed envelope. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on second side, 23 Novr 93.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas Way Junr. / 50. Upper George Street / Bryanston Square / W / London / Angleterre  \nPostmarked: Paris / [ ] / R. du Bac / [ ] / 25 / Nov / 93\n\nAlthough Whistler dated this letter November 21, a Tuesday, it was not posted until Saturday, November 25, and not received by Way until Monday, November 27; see letter 59 and letter 57 n. 32.\n\nThis was the stone Heinemann had brought to Way (letter 56), and no proofs of the drawing are known. Way wrote that the drawing was \u201ca female figure in line and stump\u201d; see Way (1912), p. 93; letter 54 n. 24; app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 18 November 1893.\n\nThe failure of the drawing is not entirely explicable. Whistler\u2019s use of the crayon estompe for drawing directly rather than for application with a stump or piece of cloth (see letter 59) would explain the jerky and spotted nature of the lines, but would not explain why the figure, which Whistler implied was drawn in part at least with the stump, printed \u201ccrude,\u201d \u201cempty,\u201d and \u201cunmodeled.\u201d Way wrote that the stone was \u201can odd bit . . . he [Whistler] had got in Paris,\u201d and if this were the case it may not have been freshly prepared for receiving a drawing; Way (1912), p. 93; letter 54 n. 24.\n\nSee letter 54 n. 24. The \u201c3 proofs\u201d refers to prints from the failed stone.\n\nBelfond. See letter 36 n. 132 and letter 53 n. 19.\n\nRegarding alterations to Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73), see letter 60, letter 61, letter 62, and letter 64. Whistler used neither this lithograph nor The Steps, Luxembourg (cat. 68), but chose instead The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) for L\u2019Estampe originale; letter 60.\n\nSee letter 55.\n\nJ. McN.

The \u201clump of ink\u201d may have been a stick of tusche, or solid ink, which was dissolved in water or other solvent to form a range of tonal washes to paint with, rather than crayon estompe, which Whistler had used previously for stump work; letter 58. The bottle of mixture \u201cfor painting\u201d may have contained a solution for mixing with the tusche stick, and the \u201cwashing out\u201d solution suggests a solvent used at a stage in the processing of the image prior to inking the work for printing, or prior to fixing the image on the stone. In letter 49, Whistler referred to \u201csolid ink to grind\u2014(a long cake or stick like Indian Ink).\u201d At the same time he also referred to one or more liquids for dissolving the ink. T. R. Way, in his reply, was reluctant to divulge his father\u2019s secrets and deliberately gave no details of the solutions involved; letter 50.\n\nJ. McN. Whistler Esqre.\n\nGUL W101.

Folded sheet, printed heading, written on all sides.\n\nWay objected to Whistler\u2019s proposed alterations to Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73); see letter 61 and letter 62. Whistler\u2019s difficulties with lithotint in October and November 1893 are clearly pointed up in this and other related correspondence; see letter 49, letter 50 , and letter 61. Explaining the nuances of different technical effects through written correspondence was difficult at best. Way\u2019s reluctance to divulge certain details of his lithographic process further complicated his communications with Whistler. T. R. Way believed that an involvement in the practical aspects of processing and printing lithographs would have resulted in many disappointments for Whistler and would have distracted him from his work as a painter; Way (1912), pp. 102\u201304.\n\nWhistler wanted to use this same procedure on four of his Lyme Regis prints in 1895 (cat. 121, cat. 123, cat. 127, and cat. 128); letter 146.\n\nSee letter 63.\n\nFGA 112.

Until 1890, 18 Green Street had been occupied by the printseller Alphonse Thibaudeau.\n\nWhistler had received some trial proofs of these subjects from Way, all of which were approved on November 21 (letter 58), and so these must have been the ones that Thomas Way was shown at Deprez and Gutekunst. Whistler continued to send lithographs to Deprez and Gutekunst in February, March, and April 1894. A list of single impressions of six lithographs priced at 2 gns. each, of which all but one were returned, was recorded on 5 February 1894, together with three impressions of Green and Yellow House (cat. 67) sold for 9 gns. Sixteen lithographs were sent on 27 February 1894, including several Luxembourg and Vitr\u00e9 subjects. Fifteen subjects were sent on 23 March 1894, mostly Chelsea lithographs but also Stephane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 60). Five more were listed for 14 April 1894 and one, The Marketplace, Vitr\u00e9 (cat. 62), was marked \u201cto be sent\u201d; GUL LB1/329, entries for 5 and 27 February 1894; GUL LB1/327, entries for 23 March and 14 April 1894.

Way wrote that Whistler must have received \u201ca very considerable income indeed\u201d from the sale of his lithographs; Way (1912), p. 102. Many aspects of Whistler\u2019s lithographic activity, exhibitions, publications, aesthetics, and the sale of his lithographs during the 1890s may be followed, at least in part, in his correspondence with collectors and dealers in America and England. Whistler also kept a record of the dispatch and purchase of individual prints in a letter book (GUL LB1) and notebook (GUL NB1). The major collectors and dealers were Howard Mansfield (see Mansfield-Whistler correspondence, GUL), Charles Lang Freer (see Freer-Whistler correspondence, GUL and FGA), and Edward Kennedy of Herman Wunderlich and Co. (see Kennedy-Whistler correspondence, GUL and NYPL) in America; and David Croal Thomson of the Goupil Gallery (see Thomson-Whistler correspondence, GUL and LC) and Marcus Bourne Huish of the Fine Art Society (see FAS-Whistler correspondence, GUL) in England.

Way] to reproduce one of Whistler\u2019s pastels, and if so it would probably have been one owned by Thomas Way. The most likely subject is The Blue Girl (M 521R; Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which was reproduced in lithography by T. R. Way and published in The Studio 31, no. 132 (March 1904). The strong blue passages suggest the use of the stump and there is a faint mechanical grain in some of the lightly drawn areas printed in a dark tone, denoting perhaps the use of papier viennois. T. R. Way\u2019s other reproductions after Whistler\u2019s pastels are in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, McCallum Collection; see also letter 39 n. 147 and n. 148.\n\nFGA 116.

Whistler also exhibited the three marines at the Grafton Gallery, London, in January 1894, together with six lithographs; letter 77. According to T. R. Way\u2019s titles (letter 80), the lithographs were: 1. Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73); 2. The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72); 3. The Dancing Girl (cat. 29); 4. Vitr\u00e9: The Canal (cat. 63); 5. The Steps, Luxembourg (cat. 68); the sixth, identified by Way as a Luxembourg drawing, may have been Conversation under the Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 69). It seems very likely that the lithographs exhibited at the Grafton Gallery were the same as those shown at the Salon, except that the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait was not included in the London show. The titles of some, however, were changed. The Draped Figure, Seated appears to have been entitled La Songeuse, even though it was known to the French public through its publication in L\u2019Estampe originale as Danseuse; see letter 53 n. 18. Somewhat confusingly, the title of cat. 29, exhibited as The Dancing Girl in London, was changed to La Danseuse for the Salon. Whistler ordered twelve proofs of each of these subjects; letter 79.\n\nFGA 118. Copy, possibly in T. R. Way\u2019s hand. Location of original unknown. Single sheet, written in pencil on one side.\n\nWhistler agreed to let The Studio publish Gants de su\u00e8de (cat. 35) on 11 December 1893, but the terms were not immediately agreeable to the artist; letter 69, letter 75, and letter 76. Whistler later received a check from Gleeson White for 10 gns. and authorized Way to print the edition; Whistler to White, 18 January 1894, FGA 184; letter 78. Gants de su\u00e8de was published in The Studio 3, no. 13 (April 1894). White wanted another lithograph for the magazine in July; see letter 93.\n\nIt was published in The Art Journal 46, no. 120 (December 1894). Negotiations withThe Art Journal were protracted due to the inability of the owners, Messrs. Virtue, to decide on a suitable subject. The prints proposed by Whistler included Conversation under the Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 69), Little Draped Figure, Leaning (cat. 76), The Long Balcony (cat. 82), and The Little Balcony (cat. 83). They finally decided on Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81), a lithograph that had been drawn especially for the periodical in February 1894; letter 81. T. R. Way wrote later of these negotiations that he acted as a sort of agent, which he found \u201cnot always an amusing task,\u201d as people did not necessarily always want what Whistler thought they ought to have; Way (1912), p. 93.\n\nSee letter 42 160 and letter 52 n. 10.\n\nFGA 118.1.

The painting, Brown and Gold: Portrait of Lady Eden (YMSM 408; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), was the subject of an action brought against Whistler by Sir William Eden in 1895. Whistler had refused to hand over the painting because he considered the payment insufficient. The case was heard in Paris and at first went against Whistler, but he later appealed with the result that in 1897 he was allowed to keep the picture, which he had by this time defaced. Whistler published an account of the whole affair in 1899 in Eden versus Whistler. The Baronet and the Butterfly: A Valentine with a Verdict (Paris, 1899).

However, Rosalind Birnie Philip linked them; see GUL LB5/49. This is probably correct, in view of Way\u2019s letter to Whistler of the previous day (letter 82), in which he recorded having just sent the proof of cat. 81. According to Rosalind Birnie Philip, the press cutting from The Saturday Review for 26 March 1892 was of a review of Whistler\u2019s retrospective exhibition at the Goupil Gallery. The present sheet, however, from pages 357\u201358, includes only a reference to new book publications, a review of stock markets, and an item on the composer Arthur Goring Thomas. The association of the press cutting with the envelope, which is postmarked 13 February 1894, appears to have no particular significance.\n\nFGA 150.

Way\u2019s catalogue of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, published in 1896.\n\nThe \u201c60\u2014stones\u201d must refer to a missing letter from T. R. Way to Whistler in which he had also asked permission to compile a catalogue of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. On March 22 Way wrote that Whistler had made fifty-six or more drawings with them; letter 86.\n\nWhistler wrote to Edward Kennedy in April 1893 that someone had offered to buy up his entire stock of lithographs; Whistler to Kennedy, postmarked 17 April 1893, NYPL I/38. Ten months later he wrote to Pennell that he was \u201cgetting together full set for your people,\u201d a few of which Pennell could choose for his article; Whistler to Pennell, 21 February [1894], LCPC box 272. Whistler later inquired of Elizabeth Pennell about The Century buying a set of his lithographs and using a few for illustrating an article on Whistler\u2019s lithographs. He enclosed a complete list of forty-seven lithographs with prices; Whistler to Elizabeth Robins Pennell, 4 November 1894, LCPC box 272. The proposed article never materialized. On 23 January 1894 Kennedy had proposed an exhibition of lithographs at Wunderlich\u2019s; Kennedy to Whistler, 23 January 1894, GUL W1215. The exhibition opened before 20 October 1894; Kennedy to Whistler, 2 and 26 October 1894, GUL W1225, W1226; Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, exh. cat.

Way] caused a misunderstanding and a rift between the artist and printer that contributed to the end of their relationship; see app. IV.1, app. IV.2, app. IV.3, app. IV.4, app. IV.5, app. IV.6, app. IV.7, app. IV.8, app. IV.9, app. IV.10.\n\nFrederick Wedmore. See n. 146.\n\nThe first catalogue of Whistler\u2019s etchings was prepared by Ralph Thomas, A Catalogue of the Etchings and Drypoints of James McNeill Whistler (London, 1874). This recorded only eighty-five subjects, several of which were given erroneous or vague titles. The second was by Frederick Wedmore, Whistler\u2019s Etchings: A Study and a Catalogue (London, 1886). This described 214 plates, but Whistler had a very low opinion of Wedmore, who had written critical reviews of Whistler\u2019s work\u2013especially of his paintings and Venice etchings. Whistler took revenge in his catalogue of the Fine Art Society exhibition Etchings and Dry points. Venice. Second Series (London, 1883), where he quoted Wedmore fifteen times; and again in the catalogue of the exhibition of his paintings at the Goupil Gallery, Nocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces (London, 1892), where he quoted from Wedmore\u2019s Four Masters of Etching and from articles in The Academy and Nineteenth Century; see Gentle Art, pp. 94\u2013105, 297\u2013331.\n\nSee see app. IV.1, app. IV.2, app. IV.3, app. IV.4, app. IV.5, app. IV.6, app. IV.7, app. IV.8, app. IV.9, and app. IV.10; letter 167.\n\nThe article was published in 1897; Elizabeth Pennell, \u201cThe Master of the Lithograph\u2014J.

Jaccaci, editor of Scribner\u2019s and illustrator for The Century, received a letter from Whistler in March 1896 referring to a forthcoming article by Pennell and enclosing a list of twelve subjects that would reproduce well and were representative of his work. Whistler wrote again in April asking Jaccaci to send him the list, which he had lost, and suggesting three new subjects for reproduction: St. Giles-in-the-Fields (cat. 167), The Butcher\u2019s Dog (cat. 166), and (promising a more effective state) The Thames (cat. 161); Whistler to Jaccaci, 28 March and 18 April 1896, LCPC box 2.\n\nSee letter 84 n. 141.\n\nJ.

The discrepancy between this list of thirty-three subjects and the total of fifty-six or more stated as having been made with the Ways is partially accounted for by a total of nineteen other lithographs known to have been printed by Way and recorded in the 1905 catalogue. Twelve of these (cat. 3, cat. 4, cat. 5, cat. 6, cat. 7, cat. 8, cat. 9, cat. 10, cat. 11, cat. 12, cat. 13, cat. 14, cat. 15, and cat. 16) belonged to the years 1878\u201379, and may have been either erased from the stone, or no longer in good enough condition to print; the remainder (cat. 19, cat. 27, cat. 28, cat. 38, cat. 39, cat. 43, and cat. 61) were printed in small numbers and if not destroyed, were presumably not valued highly by Whistler. Only one, The Fireplace (cat. 61), had been ordered to be destroyed (letter 44). Way may also have included among the fifty-six or more subjects several mother-and-child drawings, some of which had not been transferred to stones or printed at the time of writing; see cat. 51, cat. 52, cat. 53, and cat. 54.\n\nProbably Reading (cat. 17).

Bray was the printer associated with the transferring and printing of Whistler\u2019s lithographs in the 1890s, and may have been busy printing Gants de su\u00e8de (cat. 35) for the April issue of The Studio or printing the work of other artists who were contributing lithographs to the same periodical.

The occasion was the funeral procession of President Carnot, who had been assassinated by an anarchist on 24 June 1894.\n\nCat. 34, cat. 36, and cat. 37.\n\nThis concerned the rejection by the Royal Academy in April 1894 of a transfer lithograph by George Thomson on the grounds that it was not a lithograph. The Royal Academy explained that \u201ca lithograph in the strict sense of the term\u2014i.e., drawn on the stone direct\u2014is admissable; but a drawing transferred by process from paper onto stone is not a lithograph in the strict sense of the term, and is not admissable.\u201d See Thomson\u2019s letters to the Royal Academy and their reply in the Times, 19 and 30 June 1894. The Pennells related an incident in which a transfer lithograph that had been exhibited in Paris at the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d in 1895 by George Thomson was rejected by the hanging committee of the 1896 Royal Academy Exhibition because it was seen as a \u201cprocess\u201d print. At the same time, the committee saw fit to accept a lithograph made in exactly the same way by an Academician; Pennell and Pennell (1915), p. 137. Various reports of the 1897 libel action by Joseph Pennell against Frank Harris and Walter Sickert concerning transfer lithography are listed in the Selected References.\n\nFGA 126.

The lithograph was Whistler\u2019s attempt to copy the portrait Arrangement in Black and Gold: Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac (YMSM 398; The Frick Collection, New York), which he had exhibited with great success at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale des beaux-arts in May 1894. Way wrote, however, that \u201cAlas, the result was a failure; not technically, for the proofs gave exactly what he had drawn; his non-success arose from the nature of the task he had undertaken\u201d; Way (1912), p. 106. In an attempt to reproduce the rich depths of tonality achieved in the painting, Whistler had used the stump and two different makes of crayon; letter 89. His later efforts to obtain a similar effect, admittedly with a different transfer pa\u00adper, in The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102) and The Smith, Passage du Dragon (cat. 103), also failed to transfer completely; letter 118.\n\nWhistler may have been referring to Henri-Charles Gu\u00e9rard (1846\u20131897), who made an etching and mezzotint after the painting of Montesquiou that was used to illustrate Th\u00e9odore Duret\u2019s biography of the artist; Duret (1904), opp. p. 174. Gu\u00e9rard was one of the most successful and accomplished engravers of his day. A pupil of Nicolas Berthon, he exhibited at the Salon from 1870 until his death, making more than six hundred etchings, aquatints, and mezzotints; he was awarded medals at the Salons of 1882 and 1889. He collaborated with periodicals such as L\u2019Art moderne, L\u2019Illustration nouvelle, La Revue encyclop\u00eadique and Gazette des beaux-arts. After the failed lithographic portrait of Montesquiou, Whistler endeavoured to obtain a clich\u00ea (presumably a clich\u00e9 verre) for the Gazette des beaux-arts, and in correspondence referred to a Mr. Hole who was in Paris and intending to make an etching of Whistler's picture; Whistler to Thomson, [20 July 1894], LCPC box 3; see letter 93 n. 181. Despite these efforts, Whistler's portrait of Montesquiou was never illustrated in the Gazette des beaux-arts; see \u201cLe Salon de 1894,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts, 3d p\u00e9r., 12 (July\u2013December 1894), pp. 38, 42. An attempt to have the portrait reproduced for The Art Journal also presented problems. Being so dark, the painting proved difficult to photograph and clich\u00e9s, again presumably clich\u00e9s verres, were tried. A relief half-tone block was eventually made using a photograph; a proof of this was approved by Whistler and the reproduction was published in \u201cArt and Mr. Whistler,\u201d The Art Journal 46, no. 120 (December 1894), p. 361.

He was elected an Associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1878, Royal Scottish Academician in 1889, and exhibited etchings at the Royal Academy from 1873 to 1885. He executed many etchings, mainly of landscape subjects after painters such as John Chrome, John Constable, Joseph Farquharson, Cecil Lawson, and John E. Millais. He also etched plates for The Portfolio (1881, 1892), for the French periodical L\u2019Art (1888), and for The Art Journal (1882, 1897). The etching of 1897 was entitled Portrait of the Artist, and was a copy of Whistler\u2019s Arrangement in Gray: Portraitof the Painter (YMSM 122; Detroit Institute of Arts); see The Art Journal 49, no. 154 (October 1897), p. 291. Whistler informed Thomson that Hole had been in Paris and had agreed to do the etching of the Montesquiou portrait for the Gazette des beaux-arts; Whistler to Thomson, [20 July 1894], LCPC box 3; see letter 92 n. 178.\n\nSee Whistler to Thomson, postmarked 14 July 1894, LCPC box 3.\n\nWhistler corresponded with White in late July 1894 regarding a lithograph for The Studio, and encouraged him to continue to publish lithographs; Whistler to White, postmarked 17 July 1894, The Art Institute of Chicago, Walter Stanton Brewster Collection of Whistleriana. White was allowed to choose from Whistler\u2019s latest lithographs at Wellington Street, and eventually selected The Long Gallery, Louvre (cat. 86), which was published in The Studio 3, no. 18 (September 1894); see letter 97 and letter 99.\n\nFGA 130.

J. S. Virtue and Co., Ltd., was a firm of publishers, printers, and bookbinders with offices at 294 City Road, E.C.; 26 Ivy Lane, E.C.; 47 Mortimer Street, W.; and 7 Water Lane, Blackfriars, E.C. They owned The Art Journal, for which the publishing office was on Ivy Lane, and the editorial office on City Road. Whistler at first misquoted this part of his letter to Thomson but crossed out the error; Whistler to Thomson, [20 July 1894], LCPC box 3.\n\nWhistler to Thomson, [20 July 1894], LCPC box 3.\n\nFGA 133.

Way probably acknowledged receipt of them on Monday, July 23 (letter missing). Whistler did receive some proofs on Monday, July 30; letter 99.\n\nThe Marketplace, Vitr\u00e9 (cat. 62), a Brittany subject drawn in the summer of 1893; see letter 42 n. 159. The Long Gallery, Louvre (cat. 86) was selected by Gleeson White for The Studio; see letter 99.\n\nT. R. Way thought that prints made from drawings onto zinc plates were not lithographs but zincographs, since, although printed in the same way as lithographs, the chemical processing of the zinc plate was different from that of stone. He believed zincographs \u201clack the refinement of stone-work\u201d; Way (1912), pp. 142\u201343. Of this period, Cate wrote: \u201cStone was preferred by most artists, probably because of zinc\u2019s connection with industrial printing. Nevertheless, for practical reasons, zinc often replaced stone in the creation of large color lithographic posters\u201d; P. D. Cate and S. H. Hitchings, The Color Revolution\u2014Color Lithography in France, 1890\u20131900, exh. cat. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Art Gallery, 1978), p. 13.
