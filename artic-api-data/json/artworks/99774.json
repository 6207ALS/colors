    "description": "<p>This box is an example of Cornell\u2018s ability to convey ideas and associations by minimal means. A construction of thin pieces of wood is delicately balanced from the center of the metal spring coil, on which it bounces freely. The arrangement hints at the wings and propeller of a biplane, thus relating to the title, which in earlier exhibitions was listed simply as <em>Bleriot</em>. Louis Bleriot (1872-1936) was a pioneering French aviator, the first to fly across the English Channel in 1909. The strongly marked wood grain, stained pale blue, of the inner wall of the box evokes both the waves of the sea, over which early planes flew low, as well as perhaps clouds in the sky. Cornell papered the back of the box with a French newspaper, <em>L\u2019Economiste francais</em> (June 15, 1893). Given the subject of this box, the choice of paper backing\u2014always an integral part of a box\u2019s construction for the artist\u2014seems not entirely fortuitous. Another, closely related box, referred to as <em>Bleriot # 2</em>, has been dated around 1956 (estate of Joseph Cornell; New York 1980\u201382, no. 115, ill.). It differs from this one primarily in the relationship of the components within the box.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 84.</p>\n",
