    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: These small bronze sculptures are rendered with great insight and liveliness but in very different styles. Some are naturalistic, others stylized, some are very vigorous, others static. The felines look frozen. The deer appears very alert. The antelope whose long horns reach to the middle of its back seems just about to leap. The diversity of the styles illustrates the vastness of the area they came from the so called Ordos Steppe region which ranges from northwestern inner Mongolia to northeastern China. You\u2019ll notice they\u2019re all designed to slip on to some kind of support. The support was made of a perishable material most likely wood. It may have been vertical, as in the case of the antelope, the two ibexes and the birds. Or horizontal as you can see with the crouching felines and the deer. Many figures like these have been identified as ornaments made to fit over the yoke or a chariot. Each bird has one metal pellet inside so it would have jingled with the motion of the chariot. The people of the Ordos steppes were essentially pastoral. They were herders who left no written records. So we don\u2019t really know what, if anything these animals signified to the people who made them some 2500 years ago.</p>\n",
