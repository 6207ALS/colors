    "description": "<p>\u201cI loved you, and my love had no return, / And therefore my true love has been my death.\u201d These are the last words of the beautiful maiden Elaine, who dies for the unrequited love of Lancelot in Alfred Lord Tennyson\u2019s <em>Idylls of the King</em>. Victorian painters and sculptors were drawn to these tragic literary heroines, as they could represent ideals of beautiful, virtuous, silent women. Join Woman\u2019s Board Fellow Alice Boone in looking deeper at these paintings and sculptures, to see if we might detect some complex messages from these figures. </p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
