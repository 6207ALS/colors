Accordingly, along the right edge of the sheet blue colored pencil appears, but there is no blue chalk. Black and yellow colored pencil dominate the rays of light, although Ensor also used graphite and enhanced the area with alternating passages of pink and yellow chalk. Touches of orange chalk are visible, too, as are stray lines of greenish-blue pastel. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Folio 1E/F. Interactive image.\n\nfig. 2 </section>",
