She wears a tall ornamental headband, typically reserved for goddesses and imperial women. Her elaborate hairstyle, with distinct locks woven around the headband, would have required the services of a skilled hairdresser. Moreover, the use of costly marble reflects her family\u2019s wealth, while her commemoration with a finely carved portrait indicates that she was of elevated social standing.</p>\n",
