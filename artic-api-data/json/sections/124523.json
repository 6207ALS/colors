    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">In this sheet, intersecting blue and black colored pencil lines create Saint Anthony\u2019s netlike robe and ropes. They seem nautical in spirit. A curved line on the right side continues into sheet 7F to create a fish that is suspended from his robe. Unlike the sheets above, which can stand as individual compositions, this drawing serves only to connect adjacent sheets. The robe extends below into folio 8E/F, and there is no blue colored pencil along the left edge, evidence that the sheet was worked up further after it was mounted to the canvas. Pinholes\u2014perhaps made when the sheets were connected and drawn before mounting\u2014are evident in the top right and bottom left corners. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Sheet 7E.
