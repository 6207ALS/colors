    "description": "<p>After surviving the Flood, Noah\u2019s family gives thanks by sacrificing an animal. Antwerp-born Jan Wierix showed this ancient scene of thanksgiving from above, with an almost all-seeing view of the family, their sacrifice, God appearing in a cloud, and the vessel of their salvation (the ark) shown in the background at left. This subject is one of 20 in the series titled <em>The Creation and Early History of Man</em>. The delicacy of the line work and the drawing\u2019s presentation on the durable material of vellum suggest that Wierix intended this series of miniature drawings to serve as treasured possessions for a devoted collector of fine and precious things.</p>\n",
