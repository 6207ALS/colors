    "description": "<p>According to John McKendry, former curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, if nothing else survived of Robert Motherwell\u2019s oeuvre save his <em>A la Pintura</em>, he \u201cwould still be seen as a major artist of the twentieth century.\u201d Motherwell\u2019s book of 24 unbound pages, with 21 mixed intaglio prints, \u201cilluminates the poetry\u201d of Raphael Alberti. After Robert Motherwell discovered Ben Belitt\u2019s translation of Raphael Alberti\u2019s <em>A la Pintura</em> (On Painting), Motherwell recalled, \u201cI had found the text for a livre d\u2019artiste, a text whose every line set into motion my innermost painterly feelings. . . . This poetry is made for painters, and this livre was made for the poetry. I meant the two to be wedded, as in a medieval psalter, but with my own sense of the modern.\u201d Just as Motherwell was inspired by poetry, Alberti found constant source material in the visual arts. <em>A la Pintura</em> was his homage to the collection of master paintings in the Prado Museum in Madrid and was dedicated to his friend and fellow Spaniard Pablo Picasso.</p>\n",
