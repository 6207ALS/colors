    "description": "<p>The flexible identity system and marketing campaign developed by Graphic Thought Facility for the annual Frieze Art Fair relied heavily on custom photography of Regent\u2019s Park, the location of the fair. For every subsequent iteration, the firm has directed a new series of photographs to highlight different aspects of the site. The title, set in bold typeface and bound by crop marks, is overlaid on top of the images, continuing a consistent identity while nevertheless creating a distinct look for each year. While the inaugural materials featured a more traditional approach, in subsequent years the photography has become keyed into more obscure details of the location. For example, the 2005 campaign focused on details of wildlife throughout the park.</p>\n",
