Robinson, 1949.433\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent bubbly light-aquamarine glass. Shallow bowl. Cast (or perhaps sagged), tooled, wheel-cut, and polished. The vertical rim is rounded by grinding. The upper exterior wall is ground and polished and forms a collar cutting away the tops of thirty-one vertical ribs on the body. The ribs are all extremely sharp, spiral gently, and taper toward the flattened base. A central wheel-cut circle on the interior is surrounded by three concentric wheel-cut grooves that roughly define the area where the ribs terminate. For a zoomable image, see fig. 77.1.\n\nThe piece is intact, many spherical bubbles are apparent around the rim and large bubbles are in the body of the ribs. There are patches of extremely thick iridescence; weathering crust is flaking away to reveal overall pitting. Small, chip-like irregularities at rim are actually open bubbles.\n\nFragments of shallow ribbed bowls such as this one were found at Tel Anafa in Israel in great quantities during the second and less opulent period of the small site, from roughly the last decade of the first century B.C. to the end of the first quarter of the first century A.D.\n\nThis is an example of Clasina Isings\u2019s form 3a, of which there are hundreds of examples and slight variations. There are two bowls in the Toledo Museum of Art, one of pale green and the second of bluish-green, that have close profiles; one in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, of blue green with a slightly more everted rim; two in the Princeton University Art Museum, one of blue green and the second of light green; and one in the Corning Museum of Glass, of aquamarine. For a related deeper ribbed bowl in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, see cat. 75.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Berlin and Herbert, Tel Anafa II, pp. 59\u201373, nos. 286\u2013386, figs. 26\u201332, plates 15\u201317.
