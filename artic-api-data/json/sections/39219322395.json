Elegantly gloved and hatted, the reader peruses an illustrated newspaper before a sunny green backdrop. A glass of beer at left and a wooden bar attached to the journal locate this young woman in a Parisian caf\u00e9 or brasserie, where beer was a popular refreshment and periodicals were furnished for patrons\u2019 use on magazine racks. Though the model\u2019s wintry attire\u2014her high tulle collar and black coat\u2014seems out of keeping with the leafy scene behind her, the extraordinary freshness and rapidity of Manet\u2019s handling nevertheless encourage us to believe that this painting captures a discrete moment, observed and recorded on the fly at one of the artist\u2019s favorite haunts. In point of fact, however, like so many of his modern life subjects, this scene was staged in the studio, its composition carefully planned out and reworked. The picture\u2019s sense of spontaneity, therefore, is a skillfully orchestrated fiction.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, Woman Reading\u2019s most arresting feature is surely the variety and virtuosity of its paint application. The open newspaper and the reader\u2019s fichu collar (fig. 19.1) were laid in using a thin gray wash, barely articulated with overlying dashes of black and white paint, and the model\u2019s face\u2014\u201cmade up\u201d with no more than two dozen licks of color\u2014consists primarily of exposed off-white ground (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revision in the technical report). Faint scattered charcoal marks just visible under her features (fig. 19.2) do not seem to correspond to the design but may relate to an early planning phase (see Revisions in the technical report). Extraordinarily creamy, generous paint application characterizes much of the rest of the picture. Brief strokes of green, red, blue, and peach flicker and merge in the background (fig. 19.3), suggesting dappled sunlight, while rich wet-in-wet handling evokes the luxurious textures of the model\u2019s gloves (fig. 19.4) and plush hat and coat. On the bar attached to her magazine, a single dab of white evokes a wood handle polished to a shine by many readers\u2019 hands, while the beer glass at left (fig. 19.5) is served up suitably wet, its foaming head and amber depths lusciously painted alla prima.\n\nThe glass of beer and the implied public setting have fed a lively debate regarding the young reader\u2019s social status: Is she a tart? Or a lady? An illiterate leafing through a magazine for the pictures? Or a sophisticate perusing an exhibition review? Does her elegant toilette render her respectable, or suspect? As Richard Thomson has pointed out in relation to another of Manet\u2019s caf\u00e9 scenes, \u201cThe point about such paintings is that these narratives were open-ended, with several plausible explanations for the behavior represented, just as the actual watching of strangers in a public place suggests more questions than answers.\u201d To explore some of the questions raised by Woman Reading, we may begin with the title Manet himself assigned it. The artist entered two pictures in his informal account book (fig. 19.6) as having been sold to the operatic baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure in 1882: \u201cCalais\u201d\u2014likely The Port of Calais (RW I 174)\u2014and \u201cLiseuse\u201d\u2014the present work. This shorthand title describes the subject as a woman reading but withholds any further information about her identity.\n\nThe woman reader is, of course, a time-honored theme, and any number of art historical precedents could have suggested it to Manet. The most persuasive possibility may be Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s \u201cfigure de fantaisie\u201d Young Girl Reading (fig. 19.7). Both Fragonard\u2019s subject\u2014a pretty girl with a fluffy collar, engrossed in her book\u2014and his ostentatiously fluid handling here anticipate Manet\u2019s picture. More recently, in the 1870s, women readers had furnished inspiration for several of Manet\u2019s Impressionist colleagues, perhaps most notably Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Manet may not have lavished much praise on his younger colleague\u2019s work, but Renoir\u2019s 1877 Woman Reading (fig. 19.8) forms a close correlate to our Woman Reading in terms of pose and format, and the same artist\u2019s Young Woman Reading an Illustrated Journal (fig. 19.9) from around 1880 portrays a strikingly similar subject. Whereas the setting for Renoir\u2019s scenes (not to mention Fragonard\u2019s) is private, with reading used to suggest domesticity and leisure, in Manet\u2019s work women most often read in public. In the 1874 Salon painting The Railway (fig. 19.10; [RW I 207]), for example, the artist cast his favorite model, Victorine Meurent, as a nanny or an older sister sitting with her young charge beside a railway cutting, one finger thrust between the pages of a paperback. With a pier of the Pont de l\u2019Europe just visible through the steam of a passing train, this picture\u2019s setting could scarcely be more modern, Parisian, public. Unlike her counterparts in Renoir\u2019s pictures\u2014but very much like the protagonist of Woman Reading\u2014Meurent is dressed for the outdoors. The black hat she sports corresponds to those worn by Manet\u2019s other female readers; these women appear in an unfinished painting ([RW I 398]; see fig. 19.11) and a pastel (fig. 19.12; [RW II 60]). Each is absorbed in her reading material, and both are seated at caf\u00e9 tables like that in the Chicago picture. In every instance, the setting seems to be public.\n\nIf Meurent\u2019s book can plausibly be identified as a paperback novel, and the reading matter in the pastel as a text-heavy daily newspaper, the publication that appears in the Chicago painting belongs to another nineteenth-century print genre: the illustrated journal. Indeed, \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton titled this picture \u201cLa lecture de<strike>u magazine</strike> l\u2019illustr\u00e9\u201d (Reading <strike>a </strike>an <strike>magazine </strike>illustrated) in his manuscript catalogue of the artist\u2019s oeuvre. For a time, scholars took this phrase to mean that the painted periodical was Le Journal Illustr\u00e9, a weekly launched by the publishers of the daily Le Petit Journal in a bid to compete with L\u2019Illustration. The modest format of the depicted paper, however, offers a closer match to stylish digests like La Vie Parisienne and La Vie Moderne.\n\nThe cover image in the painting is too blurry to decipher, let alone to identify with a specific issue of a specific publication. Some scholars have taken Manet\u2019s summary handling here as a sign for the kind of looking to which illustrated journals invited their readers: swift, passive, distracted, consumerist\u2014and perhaps an acknowledgement that viewers would bring the same kind of looking to bear on Manet\u2019s paintings. But, while promoting consumption, illustrated magazines also spread new forms of visual discernment, appraisal, and even connoisseurship among female readers. Far from flipping through her periodical, Manet\u2019s model holds it with both hands, scanning one page so attentively that she seems oblivious to her surroundings. The fact that the artist himself contributed illustrations to La Vie Moderne and that the journal\u2019s gallery hosted his monographic exhibition of twenty-five recent works in the spring of 1880 raises the tempting possibility that this young woman might be gazing on one of Manet\u2019s own drawings reproduced in the pages, or reading an announcement of his exhibition at the affiliated gallery (fig. 19.13). The layout of the cover, however, more closely matches that of La Vie Parisienne and, in any case, eludes tidy identification.\n\nWoman Reading bears a close relationship to several of the works that Manet showed at the Vie Moderne gallery in 1880. Among the pictures exhibited there were two oil paintings of beery cabarets (fig. 19.14; [RW I 280]; fig. 19.15; [RW I 311]), another of a woman drinking brandy by herself (fig. 19.16; [RW I 282]), and pastels portraying women drinking beer (fig. 19.17 [RW II 7]) and a lone male drinker (see cat. 18, Portrait of Alphonse Maureau [RW II P 6]). That public drinking formed a kind of subtheme in the Vie Moderne exhibition seems fitting, for Georges Charpentier, owner of the gallery, was also the publisher of Manet\u2019s old ally \u00c9mile Zola, whose novel of alcoholism in working-class Paris, L\u2019Assommoir, had appeared in 1877. Though incomparably lighter in tone than Zola\u2019s work, Manet\u2019s drinking pictures plainly tapped into some visitors\u2019 anxieties about public alcohol consumption in the city\u2019s working-class neighborhoods. In his assessment of the exhibition, one conservative critic deplored \u201cthese vulgar, frightful types,\u201d and demanded \u201cWhy this series of women drinking beer and cabaret drunks?\u201d\n\nOnce the beverage of peasants, beer gained popularity in Paris over the course of the Second Empire, when Baron Haussmann\u2019s urban renewal projects drew thousands of workers from rural areas into the capital, and World\u2019s Fairs attracted foreign visitors from beer-drinking countries like Belgium and Germany. Brasseries sprang up in the city\u2019s new peripheral neighborhoods, serving food and drink at all hours of the day and night. Long hours and a socially mixed clientele made some brasseries convenient lieux de rencontre (pickup spots), even sites of clandestine prostitution. Thus the beer glass beside Manet\u2019s reader carries complicated social meaning of which the artist was surely aware. The placement of his signature in this composition just below the foaming drink (fig. 19.5) seems to acknowledge his association with beer and brasseries, which dated to the uncharacteristically successful exhibition of his Bon Bock (fig. 19.18; [RW I 186]) at the 1873 Salon. In 1877\u201378 he had grappled with a large, ambitious composition inspired by the motley clients and seedy entertainment at the Brasserie de Reichshoffen in Montmartre, an update on the merry company scenes of the Dutch Golden Age. Although he gave up on this project as a large-scale Salon submission\u2014cutting the canvas down and reworking the fragments into two pictures now in Winterthur, Switzerland (fig. 19.19 [RW I; 278]), and London (fig. 19.15)\u2014he did not abandon the brasserie theme. His Waitress Serving Beer (fig. 19.20; [RW I 319]) reimagines the London half of the Reichshoffen composition, and Caf\u00e9-Concert (fig. 19.14) is plainly set in the same cabaret. The pastel Beer Drinkers (fig. 19.17) segregates two young women from the rest of a brasserie interior, capitalizing on the powdery medium to frost their glasses.\n\nManet\u2019s own favorite brasserie was the Caf\u00e9 de la Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes, a place Pigalle hub for progressive artists and writers in the 1870s. Both the Chicago reader and the subject of Plum Brandy (fig. 19.16) have sometimes been identified as female denizens of the Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes. If these scenes were indeed meant to evoke the artist\u2019s brasserie of choice, he was not the first to draw inspiration from this establishment. Edgar Degas\u2019s 1876 In a Caf\u00e9 (also known as L\u2019Absinthe; fig. 19.21) sets its grimly ambiguous scene at the Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes, recognizable by its banquettes and mirrors. Here, the parts of a likely prostitute and her client were played by two of Manet\u2019s models from the same period: the artist Marcellin Desboutin and the actress Ellen Andr\u00e9e. Andr\u00e9e may also have posed for Manet\u2019s brandy drinker in Plum Brandy, possibly another fille insoumise (unlicensed prostitute) awaiting a customer.\n\nThe comparatively glum mood of Plum Brandy could scarcely be more different from the sparkle and verve of its counterpart in Chicago. The elegance and self-possession of the reader set her apart from the bored girl in pink who drinks and smokes gloveless, her elbows on the table. Deftly observed and catalogued, the reader\u2019s toilette includes a smart felt hat, kid gloves, a fichu of tulle, and modish bangs cut \u201c\u00e0 la chien.\u201d Her face is carefully made up\u2014her cheeks powdered, her lips rouged\u2014in an effect produced by Manet\u2019s sparing application of paint. This approach owed much to his contemporary practice in pastels (see, for instance, fig. 19.22; [RW II P 14]), where he often used just a few strokes of dry color on a pale-gray prepared canvas to indicate both his sitter\u2019s features and their cosmetic coating. Impeccable grooming, of course, was no guarantee of respectability. Indeed, one might argue that the more elaborate a woman\u2019s toilette, the more suspect her virtue. But whether or not the reader\u2019s stylishness\u2014or simply her presence, unaccompanied, in a public place where alcohol is served\u2014calls her virtue into question, she does not solicit attention or invite conversation. The borrowed journal seems to afford her a form of privacy, however temporary and contingent.\n\nWoman Reading has often been mistaken for a work actually exhibited in the Vie Moderne show under the title \u201cLa Lecture.\u201d The reasons for this confusion are simple enough. First, the generic title could easily apply to the Art Institute painting. Second, the illustrated periodical it depicts (as discussed above) bears some resemblance to the Vie Moderne in format. Third, Manet\u2019s attentiveness to his model\u2019s attire matched the editorial outlook of the Vie Moderne, where art and fashion were covered side by side. Finally, in subject Woman Reading is closely related to the drinking pictures exhibited in the 1880 show, and in style, to the rapidly brushed toilette scene Before the Mirror (fig. 19.23; [RW I 264]) also exhibited there. However, a firsthand account of the Vie Moderne show seems to rule out the possibility that this picture was the work shown as La Lecture in 1880. In his review of the exhibition, a critic for the conservative journal L\u2019Artiste referred to the work shown under the title La Lecture as \u201cone of those that offer the fewest taches,\u201d continuing, \u201cthe figure of the woman has charming qualities.\u201d The bravura Impressionist brushwork in Woman Reading makes it one of the most daringly painted pictures in Manet\u2019s oeuvre; this work could hardly be described\u2014even in the up-to-the-minute context of the Vie Moderne show\u2014as \u201chaving the fewest taches.\u201d Moreover, a human figure so shamelessly dissolved into light and color would never have been described as \u201ccharming\u201d by the same writer who deplored Manet\u2019s \u201cvague scribbles\u201d and \u201cindecipherable sketches.\u201d As Juliet Wilson-Bareau has explained, the far likelier candidate for this description is a picture painted more than ten years before, the portrait of a still-youthful Madame Manet (fig. 19.24; [RW I 136]). The artist added the reader at right, a profile portrait of L\u00e9on Leenhoff, at some point in the interceding decade. Seen in the context of such breathlessly brushy works as Before the Mirror, this relatively sober, lightly reworked portrait from the mid-1860s would more plausibly have appeared to \u201coffer the fewest taches.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, the formal content of Woman Reading itself suggests that this painting could not have been exhibited in the spring of 1880. For Woman Reading is a painting staged in front of another painting, and, in the spring of 1880, the picture that appears in the background here had yet to be painted. As Wilson-Bareau first pointed out, the somewhat inchoate garden scene behind Manet\u2019s reader\u2014described by various authors as a mirror, a greenhouse, a caf\u00e9 garden, and a painted decoration on a brasserie wall\u2014in fact seems to correspond to a quite specific painting, evidently hung on the wall behind the model, her table, and her newspaper in the artist\u2019s rue d\u2019Amsterdam studio. He spent the late summer and fall (from June to early November) of 1880 at Bellevue, a small suburbanized town west of Paris, where he undertook a course of water treatments for his advancing locomotor ataxia. Bored and lonely, the invalid produced little finished work there aside from the witty, poignant watercolors with which he illustrated letters to friends back in Paris or on the coast. Four surviving oil paintings, however, document the garden of the artist\u2019s rented villa in the route des Gardes, its gravel path dappled with sunlight (fig. 19.25; [RW I 343]; fig. 19.26; [RW I 347]; fig. 19.27; [RW I 348]; fig. 19.28; [RW I 349]). Three of these (fig. 19.25, fig. 19.26, and fig. 19.27) feature a zinc watering can, presumably the same that appears in an ink-and-wash drawing (fig. 19.29; [RW II 674]) and in a letter Manet sent to his friend, the printmaker F\u00e9lix Bracquemond (fig. 19.30; [RW II 582]).\n\nThe same vessel, with the same sun-dappled path behind it, appears just to the right of the model in the background of Woman Reading. Given the dimensions of this background picture, it was most likely painted from Watering Can (fig. 19.27), which measures 98 \u00d7 61 cm. The same painting\u2014sans watering can\u2014also seems to have furnished the backdrop for another composition likely completed back in Paris, a portrait of Madame Gamby (also known as La Promenade; fig. 19.31; [RW I 338]). Manet\u2019s reliance on Watering Can\u2014and not merely a memory of the garden it depicts\u2014seems to be corroborated by the band of golden-yellow paint that runs vertically from the top of Woman Reading to the upper edge of the illustrated journal, several inches left of center (fig. 19.32 and see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revision in the technical report). A layer of green brushstrokes partially conceals this band, but here, surely, was once a picture frame. As if to enhance the illusion that his model was actually seated either on a caf\u00e9 terrace or before a plate glass window giving onto one, Manet painted over this golden band, extending the greenery to the left, beyond the edge of Watering Can\u2019s composition. Traces of the frame nevertheless hint at Manet\u2019s studio artifice.\n\nIf the artist\u2019s return from Bellevue to Paris in November 1880 provides a terminus post quem for this picture, the sale to Faure in March 1882 provides a terminus ante quem. Faure\u2019s was the most comprehensive collection of Manet\u2019s pictures ever assembled by a private individual. His appetite for the artist\u2019s work (and especially his tendency to sell and trade) has caused some to regard him as a kind of dealer-speculator. And, indeed, it is not inconceivable that he bought Woman Reading sight unseen; Tabarant explains that Faure was on tour in Monte Carlo at the time of the sale, which was negotiated by post. Hung amongst the more highly finished examples of Manet\u2019s work that Faure generally favored, Woman Reading may have looked somewhat out of place. The collector seems, nevertheless, to have formed an attachment to this picture, which remained in his possession until his death. Woman Reading apparently stayed with the family until 1928, when the label from an exhibition at Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, describes it as \u201cbelonging to M. J. Faure.\u201d Little more than a year after that exhibition, the painting had crossed the Atlantic to New York, where it caught the eye of the great Chicago collector Annie Swan Coburn. Photographed in her art-crowded suite at the Blackstone Hotel (fig. 19.33), Woman Reading was one of seven Manets in Mrs. Coburn\u2019s collection and four she bequeathed, upon her death in 1932, to the Art Institute.\n\nReturning once more, in closing, to the vexed question of the young reader\u2019s identity and place in the world, a nickname associated with the model for this figure\u2014\u201cTrognette\u201d\u2014offers a tantalizing potential clue. This unusual slang diminutive translates roughly to \u201clittle bitty face\u201d and seems to have made its first appearance in the Manet literature in 1925, when an exhibition review lists the Chicago picture as \u201cReader with a Hat (Trognette).\u201d One woman known as \u201cTrognette\u201d did leave a mark in the public record in late nineteenth-century Paris, and, whether she was the model for Manet\u2019s scene or not, her story offers insight into the ambiguous position of women like the one depicted here. Born Antoinette Cazal in 1866, this Trognette was arrested just north of Paris in March 1894 (fig. 19.34). Her common-law husband, L\u00e9on Ortiz, was an anarchist, tried and convicted that fall in the infamous \u201cProc\u00e8s des trente,\u201d and the couple\u2019s story briefly filled Parisian newspapers. Designated a \u201cfille\u201d on her 1894 mugshot, where her age is given as twenty-eight, Cazal had light brown or red hair cut into bangs, symmetrical features, and a pert nose. She would have been about fifteen at the time Manet painted Woman Reading. Portrayed in the popular press as a slatternly drunk, Cazal was described in more sympathetic (and familiar) terms in an anonymous letter to the editor of Le Radical:\n\nShe was an entirely charming little woman, pale, graceful and appealing. Always impeccably dressed, gloved and tastefully put together, . . . we all agreed that she had a \u201cgrande dame\u201d air about her. . . . As for the nickname . . . the teasing name of Trognon that she gave to her husband heartily amused us all, thus, we named her Mme Trognon, or, more simply Trognette . . . As for her appearance in a brasserie . . . she was there barely eight days when Ortiz, filled with compassion at the sight of her so out of place in such a setting, took her away to make her his companion before she had even been deflowered.\n\nFrom her pale face to her irreproachable toilette, from her gloves to her \u201cgrande dame\u201d air, the image of this young woman so out of place in the compromising setting of a brasserie was just the sort of modern Parisian sight that might have inspired Woman Reading. Of course this painting, as we have seen, is no spontaneous slice of life, but a scene carefully staged in the artist\u2019s studio. In the end, the identity of Manet\u2019s model is less important to our understanding of this picture than the crafty theatrics of its mise-en-scene: the painted backdrop borrowed from Bellevue, the studio-prop caf\u00e9 table and beer glass. Painted at a moment when Manet\u2019s illness had reduced his mobility, narrowing the artist\u2019s world to the block between his rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg apartment and his rue d\u2019Amsterdam studio, the bold Impressionist handling of Woman Reading seems to insist \u201chere is a scene observed out in the world and sketched on the fly,\u201d poignantly laying claim to the status of fl\u00e2neur for a painter who could barely walk.  \nEmily A. Beeny\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Woman Reading is painted on a pre-primed, no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. A supplier\u2019s stamp from the color merchant Henry was documented on the back of the original canvas before the painting was lined. The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. There are several drawing lines underneath the sitter\u2019s face and collar, above the hat and magazine, and under the proper left hand and the lower part of the magazine. It is unclear whether the drawing is related to the final composition or was executed for an entirely different composition. If the former, the final painting often does not closely follow the drawing lines, many of which remain visible on the surface in unpainted areas of exposed ground such as the face. The sitter\u2019s face and collar and the magazine are thinly painted with washes of color, open brushwork, and areas of exposed ground. The hat and coat were laid in with thin dark-brown washes and then built up with more solid paint applications. The landscape was painted with discrete textural strokes and touches of impasto. Manet carried out the work in more than one session, making some small adjustments to the shape of the woman\u2019s hat, the collar, and the position of the hands. He inscribed a border into the wet paint just inside the original foldovers. Some final brushstrokes were added afterward on the top and right edges.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 19.35).\n\nSigned: Manet (lower left, in dark-blue paint) (fig. 19.36). The painting was dry when the signature was applied (fig. 19.37).\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 60.5 \u00d7 49.5 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (60 \u00d7 50 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.4V (0.6) \u00d7 23.4H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave matches were detected with other paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is fairly consistent, mild to moderate cusping around all four sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1966 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced approximately 7\u20138 cm apart. The canvas was restretched on a slightly larger stretcher than the original, resulting in a border of unpainted ground around the edges.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 3\u20136.5 cm apart. The cusping on the tacking edges appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes (fig. 19.38). Some of the tacks are located very close to the edge of the canvas, and in several places the holes have torn through to the edge of the fabric (fig. 19.39). The use of canvas pliers is suggested by intermittent \u201cteeth\u201d marks around the edges of the original canvas, likely related to the narrow width of the tacking margins (fig. 19.40).\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded/not documented.\n\nA stamp on the back of the original canvas was transcribed before the painting was lined in 1966 (see Conservation History): ANC<sup>ne</sup> M<sup>son</sup> ANGE OTTOZ / Henry &amp; [illegible/crossed out] S[<sup>ucr</sup>] / M<sup>de</sup> de Couleurs Fines / PARIS / 2 R de la MICHODI\u00c8RE (fig. 19.41).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric. The canvas was probably commercially prepared. The ground layer is quite thin, ranging in thickness from approximately 20\u201350 \u00b5m (fig. 19.42).\n\nWarm, off-white; some red and dark particles are visible microscopically (fig. 19.43).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground is composed of lead white and barium sulfate (barite) with traces of silica, various silicates, and calcium-based whites including chalk. Lead white, barium sulfate, and calcium compounds are present in a variety of particle sizes ranging from very fine to extremely large (fig. 19.44). While the chemical composition appears consistent throughout the sample, different areas of the ground seem to be characterized by slight differences in amounts of binder present and packing density of the pigment particles, and/or relative proportions of materials with high and low atomic numbers. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nThere are several drawn lines in the area of the sitter\u2019s face and collar, in the background landscape and frame, and in the lower right part of the magazine. The drawing was executed directly over the ground layer. Some of the drawing is visible on the surface of the painting in areas where the ground was left exposed (fig. 19.45, fig. 19.46); other lines can be visualized only with the aid of infrared reflectography (fig. 19.47). In some places, lines were not visible on the surface of the painting nor in the infrared image, but some black particles were visible microscopically at gaps in the brushwork of thickly painted passages (fig. 19.48). It is possible that additional lines are obscured by dark or thick paint applications.\n\nThe underdrawing material was not analyzed but it has the appearance of a dry medium, such as charcoal (fig. 19.49).\n\nNo specific forms are discernible among the drawn lines, and since they do not obviously relate to the painted image, it remains unclear whether the lines represent underdrawing from which the artist diverged when painting the final composition or whether the drawing relates to an entirely different composition. Some individual lines do seem to correspond to the painted composition\u2014for example, those around the woman\u2019s bangs or along the proper right side of her face. Others could be interpreted as representing a different placement of the compositional elements; for example, it is possible that the lines above the hat and the magazine could indicate that those features were drawn closer to the top edge of the canvas, and that the artist shifted the sitter down in the final composition (fig. 19.50). The evidence, however, is insufficient to advance any firm conclusions.\n\nThe darker passages of the composition were laid in using thin washes of dark-brownish paint. An isolated drip mark on the bottom edge seems to be related to the dilute paint that was used to block in the forms (fig. 19.51). Similarly, broadly applied strokes of thin green and gray paint were used to lay in parts of the landscape (fig. 19.52). These areas were then built up relatively densely, with Manet using fairly continuous paint layers in the hat and coat, and a more open network of thick brushstrokes and low impasto throughout the landscape. The face, collar, and magazine, on the other hand, are much more thinly painted, with dilute veils of translucent color and exposed ground visible on the surface. The magazine and the collar are both built up from a very thin pale-gray wash (fig. 19.53). In the face, the exposed off-white ground layer serves for much of the flesh tone with strokes of varying shades of pale pink and pale peach used to contour the features (fig. 19.54). The translucency of these areas compared with the more thickly built-up paint passages can be seen in the transmitted-light image (fig. 19.55).\n\nAlthough at first glance the painting may appear to be openly and rapidly executed, it was actually carried out in several sessions, and the artist made a number of small adjustments to the composition while building it up. Close examination of the woman\u2019s hat shows that it initially had a different shape. The infrared reflectogram reveals an area of dark paint from the lay-in, on the left side just above the brim of the final hat, which was later covered by the landscape (fig. 19.56). Magnified views of the area show that the lay-in consisted of a thin wash of dark brownish-black paint in this area (fig. 19.57). Similar dark underlayers were also observed beneath the foliage on the right side of the hat (fig. 19.58). Microscopic examination also shows that the lay-in of the landscape, executed with thin green paint strokes, extends underneath the lower left and right lobes of the hat. Green paint can be seen through small breaks and drying cracks in the dark-brown paint from the hat (fig. 19.59, fig. 19.60, fig. 19.61). Paint from the landscape, including some of the more built-up surface strokes of the foliage, also extends under the top part of the hat. The pointed stroke at the peak of the hat was clearly applied later over the already dry strokes of the bottom of the tree (fig. 19.62). This evidence indicates that several adjustments were made to the hat at different stages of the painting process before the artist arrived at the final form. Small areas of exposed ground throughout most of the landscape indicate that it was built up directly on top of the ground layer. By contrast, the area on the left side, above the magazine, was painted over earlier paint layers, suggesting that Manet extended the landscape farther to the left by approximately 6\u20137 cm. The earlier paint layers include the gray underlayer that continues toward the upper left corner and, farther to the right, vertical strokes of yellow and orangey-brown that mark the original left edge of the landscape (fig. 19.63).\n\nThe lower part of the painting is relatively densely built up, and several changes in this area suggest that the artist labored over this part of the composition to some extent. The contour of the shoulder was emended by the blue strokes of the landscape detail behind the figure, which blend wet-in-wet with the brown paint of the coat (fig. 19.64). The X-ray indicates that more of the wispy gray collar was painted and then covered by dark-brown paint from the coat (fig. 19.65). The X-ray also shows a change to the position of the woman\u2019s proper left hand (fig. 19.66). Microscopic examination reveals a layer of light-colored paint underneath the coat and glove in this area (fig. 19.67). Under the woman\u2019s proper right hand, a series of parallel ridges from underlying brushstrokes suggest that the bottom end of the wooden magazine-holder bar was initially painted in here, then covered by the hand (fig. 19.68). Several horizontal brush marks are clearly visible in the X-ray underneath the beer stein (fig. 19.69), possibly indicating that more of the tabletop was originally included in the painting. The glass was painted when the underlying layers were already dry.\n\nAt some point late in the painting stage, Manet went around the edges of the composition, inscribing a border into the wet paint. In some areas the paint was scraped down to the ground, or even to the bare canvas (fig. 19.70). Displaced paint sometimes formed a ridge on one or both sides of the furrow created. It is difficult to tell what kind of tool was used for this. The width of the resulting furrow varies, ranging from 1\u20136 mm. The painting was well developed when the border was created, as the implement was clearly dragged through the thick wet-paint layers of the glass of beer on the left side (fig. 19.71) and the strokes of impasto in the foliage at the upper right edge (fig. 19.72). In a few places, additional strokes of paint were added after the border had been inscribed. This can be seen in the thin strokes of gray paint at the left side of the top edge, the top strokes of the left tree in the upper right corner (fig. 19.73), and the dark-paint stroke of the coat added along the lower right edge (fig. 19.74). These later strokes must have been added wet-over-dry, since the ridges of displaced paint along the border remained undisturbed when the paint was brushed over them.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, Naples yellow, cadmium yellow, iron oxides, vermilion, red lake (prepared as a mixture of madder and cochineal), emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and bone black. Cross-sectional analysis of red lake\u2013containing paint layers shows the presence of several large, round starch grains incorporated within the paint (fig. 19.75, fig. 19.76).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThere is an even, somewhat glossy layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA that was applied in 1966 (see Conservation History). The pre-treatment notes state that the painting previously had a discolored and yellowed soft-resin varnish, which was removed in the 1966 treatment.\n\nIn 1966 discolored varnish was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and stretched on a redwood ICA spring stretcher. A spray coating of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. The stretcher is slightly larger than the original, resulting in a thin border of unpainted ground around the edges. The original tacking edges and corners are worn and torn in places. There are some small ground losses and abrasion on the tacking edges and foldovers, and in the furrow of the border scraped around the edges of the painting. Several lines drawn directly over the ground remain visible in places on the surface of the painting. The paint layer is secure. There are a few localized areas of drying cracks in the landscape and the dark paint of the woman\u2019s costume. There is some minor cracking in the thicker, lead white\u2013rich brushstrokes of the magazine. Areas of slightly flattened impasto are probably related to the lining procedure. There are some residues of the wax-resin lining adhesive on the paint surface, especially in the furrow of the inscribed border. Starch-paste residues, from the facing applied before the lining procedure, are visible microscopically on the surface of the painting. These are particularly apparent in areas containing red lake, where some interaction appears to have occurred with the pigment (fig. 19.77). The painting has a synthetic varnish layer. There are several microscopic traces of what appear to be yellow paint and metallic gold scattered intermittently around the edges of the painting; these residues are especially visible at the upper left edge.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1999): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an eighteenth-century French Louis XVI entablature frame with acanthus-leaf-and-tongue ornament. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and carved ornament. The gilding is burnished on the sides and top fillet as well as selectively burnished on the ornament on the scotia. The original gilding has been damaged and portions have overgilding. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines. The molding from the perimeter to the interior is fillet, scotia side, fillet, cove, fillet, cove, reverse ogee with acanthus-leaf-and-tongue, fillet, fillet, fillet with centered bead, ogee with acanthus-leaf-and-tongue, and cove sight (fig. 19.78). The frame\u2019s section width is 12.5 cm (4 7/8 in.).\n\nPrevious frame (installed at least by 1960; removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously housed in an eighteenth-century French Louis XIV ogee frame with corner and center cartouches linked with foliate scrolls with a hollow frieze and an independent fillet liner (fig. 19.79).\n\nPrevious frame (installed at least by 1933; removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously housed in what appears to be a twentieth-century French Louis XIV ogee frame with linked foliate scrolls and lambrequin centered corner cartouches with a hollow frieze, a gadrooned sight, and an independent fillet liner (fig. 19.80, fig. 19.81).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1884; removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously installed in a nineteenth-century French Louis XIV Revival frame with an ogee profile with cast plaster foliate ornament with corner rocaille cartouches and foliate flower centers, a sanded frieze, and leaf-tip sight (fig. 19.82).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Jean-Baptiste Faure (1830\u20131914), Paris, March 1882.\n\nBy descent to his son, Maurice Faure (1862\u20131915).\n\nPossibly still with the Faure family in 1928.\n\nPossibly Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, in 1928 or 1929.\n\nHoward Young Galleries, New York, by 1929.\n\nSold to Mrs. Lewis (Annie Swan) Coburn (1856\u20131932), Chicago, 1929.\n\nBy bequest from Mrs. Lewis (Annie Swan) Coburn to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, \u00c9cole nationale des beaux-arts, Exposition des \u0153uvres de \u00c9douard Manet, Jan. 6\u201328, 1884, no. 92.\n\nParis, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Oeuvres de XIXe et XXe si\u00e8cles, summer 1925, no. 78.\n\nParis, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres de Manet, au profit des \u201cAmis du Luxembourg,\u201d Apr. 14\u2013May 4, 1928, no. 25, pp. 9 (ill.), 14.\n\nBerlin, Galerie M.

The terminus post quem of 1880 for this picture was first proposed by Juliet Wilson-Bareau (see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, \u201cThe Manet Exhibition in Paris, 2011,\u201d The Burlington Magazine 153, no. 305 [Dec. 2011], p. 822.).\n\nI owe profound thanks to Scott Allan and Regina Noto for their invaluable bibliographic assistance with this entry.\n\nWhen this picture was acquired by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn in 1929, a reporter for Art News described it as \u201cdashed off from a hasty sketch made without the knowledge of the girl herself.\u201d See \u201cChicago Woman Acquires a Famous Manet,\u201d Art News 27, no. 40 (Sept. 14, 1929), p. 12.\n\nSee also Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 74.\n\n\u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton hints at this possibility in Manet: Racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame. vol. 2 ( H. Laurens, 1926), p. 53: \u201cIn the same vein, this cafe corner inhabited by a pretty little thing, appealing despite the marks of a late night.\u201d (Tel encore ce coin de caf\u00e9 habit\u00e9 par un minois piquant malgr\u00e9 les tares de la noce.) More recently, the young reader\u2019s social status has formed the central concern for social art historians\u2019 discussion of this work. See, for example, Nathalie Malterre, \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 et vie parisienne dans l\u2019oeuvre de Manet,\u201d (PhD diss., Universit\u00e9 de Paris IV, 1988), p. 292. On filles insoumises and their depiction in Impressionist paintings, see Nienke Bakker, et al., Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res: Images de la prostitution, 1850\u20131910, exh. cat. (Flammarion/Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Van Gogh Museum, 2015); and Hollis Clayson\u2019s classic study Painted Love: Prostitution in French Art of the Impressionist Era (Yale University Press, 1991).\n\nAs Charles S. Moffett seemed to suggest in his exhibition catalogue entry on this picture, \u201cthe image itself presents a dignified, apparently affluent woman. Like many of the other women Manet painted in the late 1870s, this well-to-do individual appears to be a characteristic Parisian type representative of a certain aspect of \u2018la vie moderne.\u2019\u201d See Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983), no. 174.\n\nRichard Brettell has advanced this interpretation, proposing, \u201cIt seems that Manet here mocked his model\u2019s intelligence, for there is nothing expressive about her face, and he has made it quite clear that her magazine is filled with pictures instead of text. Indeed, she looks rather than reads. By focusing the young woman\u2019s attention on such prosaic reading matter, Manet seems to have been poking fun at the tradition of painting solitary female readers or muses.\u201d See French Impressionists (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1987), p. 49. Marni Riva Kessler has offered a similar interpretation, asserting, \u201cThat the figure in the picture is reading an illustrated journal . . . tells us she is not necessarily literate.\u201d See Sheer Presence: The Veil in Manet\u2019s Paris (University of Minnesota, 2006), p. 45. On the class connotations of illustrated reading matter in this work, see also Simon Morley, Writing on the Wall: Word and Image in Modern Art (Thames and Hudson, 2003), p. 20.\n\nKathryn Brown has proposed this alternative; see Women Readers in French Painting 1870\u20131890: A Space for the Imagination (Ashgate, 2012), p. 36.\n\nRichard Thomson, \u201cAmbiguity, Allure and Uncertainty,\u201d in Nienke Bakker, et al., Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res: Images de la prostitution, 1850\u20131910, exh. cat.

A letter, which dates the transaction to March, from the artist\u2019s brother, Eug\u00e8ne Manet, to his wife, Berthe Morisot, laments, \u201c\u00c9douard just has sold two pictures very cheaply to Faure, who has robbed him.\u201d (Edouard vient de vendre deux tableaux bon march\u00e9 \u00e0 Faure qui l\u2019a ran\u00e7onn\u00e9.)

Floury, 1902], no. 255) in the first published catalogue raisonn\u00e9 hardly helped matters.\n\nThough the whereabouts of Fragonard\u2019s picture between 1845 and 1889 are unknown, various scholars have suggested a connection to Woman Reading; see, for example, Jean-Pierre Cuzin and Dimitri Salmon, \u201cLes XIXe si\u00e8cles de Fragonard,\u201d in Fragonard/Regards crois\u00e9s (Meng\u00e8s, 2007), p. 139. On Fragonard\u2019s Young Girl Reading and the ensemble of \u201cfigures de fantaisie\u201d to which it belongs, see, most recently, Yuriko Jackall, with Michael Swicklik and John K. Delaney, Fragonard: The Fantasy Figures, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 2017). In about 1874 Manet himself described another of his own works (La Dame aux eventails [RW I 208]) in terms apparently borrowed from Fragonard\u2019s \u201cfigures de fantaisie\u201d (Manet to Hector de Callias): \u201cMon cher Callias, J\u2019ai fait une figure de fantaisie d\u2019apr\u00e8s Mme de Villars [sic] et non un portrait.\u201d (My Dear Callias, I made a fantasy figure after Mme de Villars and not a portrait.).

Floury, 1902], no. 64) and many scholars since have attributed to Manet a picture (La Liseuse, RW I 114) of a female reader seated in a domestic interior before a reduced version of the Dead Toreador (RW I 72).\n\nOn this picture, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet, Monet, and the Gare Saint-Lazare (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Yale University Press, 1998), pp. 41\u201363.\n\nThe Lochard photograph of the pastel bears the inscription \u201cfait d\u2019apr\u00e8s un mod\u00e8le dans l\u2019atelier de la rue d\u2019Amsterdam,\u201d suggesting a studio procedure similar to that for Woman Reading.

See Jean Sutherland Boggs et al., Degas, exh. cat. (\u00c9ditions de la R\u00e9union des mus\u00e9es nationaux /Metropolitan Museum of Art/National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, 1988), no. 172. If this picture did indeed figure in the 1876 exhibition, it was exhibited under no. 52 (\u201cDans un caf\u00e9\u201d).\n\nDesboutin and Andr\u00e9e posed for Manet\u2019s grand typological portraits L\u2019Artiste (RW I 244) and La Parisienne (RW I 236), respectively. Andr\u00e9e was also the original model for another caf\u00e9 picture, Chez le P\u00e8re Lathuille (RW I 291) but was apparently replaced by Judith French after missing a sitting.\n\nTheodore Reff (Manet and Modern Paris: One Hundred Paintings, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs by Manet and His Contemporaries, exh cat. [National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1982], no. 22) proposed Andr\u00e9e as the likely model for Plum Brandy. But, as Charles S. Moffett has pointed out, the resemblance is not particularly convincing. See Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983), no. 165, entry by Moffett. For the woman\u2019s identification as a prostitute, see Th\u00e9odore Duret, Histoire d\u2019\u00c9douard Manet et de son oeuvre (H. Floury, 1902), p. 171: \u201cUne femme, de celles, qui attendant dans les caf\u00e9s la rencontre \u00e0 venir, accoud\u00e9e sur une table, regarde l\u2019oeil vague, devant elle, dans le n\u00e9ant de sa pens\u00e9e.\u201d (One of those women who wait for the next encounter in a cafe, elbows on the table, staring vacantly into their own empty thoughts.)\n\nSee Adolphe Tabarant, Manet et ses oeuvres (Gallimard, 1947), p. 327: \u201cShe sports a black felt hat, slightly turned up above her forehead, covered by bangs \u2018\u00e0 la chien\u2019.\u201d Her neck disappears into a tulle collar.

On Manet\u2019s pastel technique, see also the technical and curatorial essays for Portrait of Alphonse Maureau (cat. 18).\n\nSo entangled were fashion and prostitution that the first number of La Vie Moderne contained a plea penned by Bergerat: \u201cPerhaps the time has also come to show that the elegant woman is not necessarily an adventuress or the fine lady, a floozy.\u201d \u00c9mile Bergerat, \u201cNotre programme,\u201d La vie moderne 1, no. 1 (1879), pp. 2\u20133: \u201cPeut-\u00eatre est-il temps aussi de d\u00e9montrer que toutes les femmes \u00e9l\u00e9gantes ne sont pas n\u00e9cessairement des aventuri\u00e8res, toutes les grandes dames des gourgandines.\u201d\n\nAs Carol Armstrong, explains, \u201cAlthough the beer on the table beside her and her presence alone at a caf\u00e9 would seem to mark her, like the woman with the cigarette in Plum Brandy, as something other than a femme honn\u00eate, the image suggests no possibility of transaction with her\u2014that, at any rate, seems not to be its theme.\u201d Armstrong, \u201cFacturing Femininity: Manet\u2019s \u2018Before the Mirror,\u2019\u201d October 74 (Autumn 1995), p. 93.\n\nNo. 10 in the exhibition catalogue.

On the image as a caf\u00e9 garden, see Kathleen Adler, who has suggested that this might be the same interior garden depicted in Chez le P\u00e8re Lathuille (Manet [Phaidon, 1986],p. 200). On the image as a painted decoration on a brasserie wall, see Richard Brettell (French Impressionists [Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1987], p. 49), who points to the model\u2019s cold-weather clothing as evidence that the greenery cannot be real. Manet moved into his final rue d\u2019Amsterdam studio on April 1, 1879. On his various studios, their locations and decoration, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, \u201cE\u0301douard Manet dans ses ateliers,\u201d in Akiya Takahashi, ed., Manet et le Paris moderne, exh. cat., (Muse\u0301e Mitsubishi Ichigokan, 2010), pp. 304\u201313; and Juliet Wilson-Bareau, \u201c\u00c9douard Manet dans ses ateliers,\u201d Ironie: Interrogation critique et ludique no. 161 (Jan./Feb. 2012), http://interrogationcritiqueludique.blogspot.com/2012/10/ironie-n161-janvierfevrier-2012.html.\n\nHaving misread the postmark on one of Manet's letters from Bellevue, Adolphe Tabarant suggested that Manet stayed there twice, once in 1879, and again in 1880 (Tabarant, Manet et ses oeuvres [Gallimard, 1947], p. 365). Juliet Wilson-Bareau has since offered detailed and persuasive arguments for a a single stay, from June to November 1880 (see Wilson-Bareau, Manet by Himself [Macdonald Illustrated, 1991], p. 242; and Gary Tinterow, et al., Manet/Velazquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2003), p. 504, no. 162, n. 5 [entry by Wilson-Bareau]).\n\nOn the letters from Bellevue, see Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Manet, lettres \u00e0 Isabelle, M\u00e9ry et autres dames (Arts et M\u00e9tiers Graphiques/Skira, 985); Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet par lui-m\u00eame (Atlas, 1991), pp. 242\u201358; and Carol Armstrong, \"Manet's Little Nothings,\" in Manet and Modern Beauty, ed.

See also the curatorial essay for Head of a Woman and Head of a Bearded Man (cat. 20).\n\nJuliet Wilson-Bareau points out that the Chicago picture and Madame Gamby share a common backdrop, proposing the B\u00fchrle collection picture (fig. 19.26 [RW I 347]) as that backdrop (see Wilson-Bareau to Frank Zuccari and Gloria Groom, Jan. 30, 2014, email correspondence, curatorial object file, Department of European Painting and Sculpture, Art Institute of Chicago). I consider Watering Can the likelier candidate.\n\nOngoing analysis of another late picture portraying a pretty girl against a garden backdrop (Jeanne [Printemps]; RW I 372) by J. Paul Getty Museum conservator Devi Ormond seems to suggest that Manet did occasionally continue working on paintings after they had already been framed. Traces of gold leaf, doubtless deposited by a frame, are sandwiched between original paint layers along the bottom edge of that composition. See Devi Ormond and Catherine Patterson, \u201cThe Making of a Modern Parisienne: Manet\u2019s Methods and Materials,\u201d in Manet and Modern Beauty, ed. Scott Allan, Emily A. Beeny, and Gloria Groom, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/J. Paul Getty Museum, 2019).\n\nHe acquired at one time or another sixty-eight works by Manet; only dealers could compete.

Faure rationalized this trend in an interview with Frederic Gilbert for Le Gaulois, Jan. 6, 1884: \u201cJust as I followed him in the path that seemed to me the correct one, so I abandoned him in his exaggerations\u201d (Autant je l\u2019ai suivi dans la voie qui m\u2019a sembl\u00e9 la bonne, autant je l\u2019ai abandonn\u00e9 dans ses exag\u00e9rations).\n\nJust four works by Manet are known to have remained in Faure\u2019s collection at the time of his death in November 1914: Bob, Chien Griffon (Bob, Griffon Dog; RW I 253), Liseuse \u00e0 la Brasserie (i.e., Woman Reading), Portrait de J-B Faure en Costume de ville (J. B. Faure in a Suit; possibly RW I 390), and the watercolor Deux prunes (Two plums; RW II 588).

See Pierre Larousse, Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle (Administration du grand dictionnaire universel), 17 vols. (1870), s.v. \u201ctrognon.\u201d I have not been able to corroborate Theodore Reff\u2019s translation of this term as \u201clittle beery face\u201d; see Manet and Modern Paris: One Hundred Paintings, Drawings, Prints, and Photographs by Manet and His Contemporaries, exh cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1982), no. 22.\n\nThis was a review of a 1925 exhibition at Bernheim-Jeune, where Woman Reading was displayed as no. 78; see \u201cUne exposition de peinture, dix-neuvi\u00e8me et vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cles,\u201d Bulletin de la Vie Artistique 6, no. 13 (July 1, 1925), p. 276: \u201cNext we come to Manet, represented by some fifteen lovely little still lifes, one of his portraits of Berthe Morisot and another of Isabelle Lemonnier, the Reader in a Hat (Trognette), the Beach, and then the famous watercolor of the Olympia.\u201d (Nous arrivons alors \u00e0 Manet, que repr\u00e9sentent avec une quinzaine de ravissantes petites natures mortes, l\u2019un de ses portraits de Berthe Morisot, et l\u2019un de ceux qu\u2019il fit d\u2019Isabelle Lemonnier, la Liseuse en chapeau [Trognette], la Plage, puis encore la fameuse aquarelle de l\u2019Olympia.) Four years later, Tabarant explained that the model who posed this picture, \u201cbore the surname Trognette (and not \u2018Tronquette,\u2019 as it is sometimes written), by which the picture is also known\u201d (La femme qui posa cette Liseuse portait le surnom de \u2018Trognette\u2019, [et non \u2018Tronquette\u2019, comme on l\u2019\u00e9crit quelquefois], sous lequel on connait aussi le tableau.) Adolphe Tabarant, Manet: Histoire catalographique (Montaigne, 1931), p. 341. Paul Jamot and George Wildenstein specify, somewhat confusingly, that the picture was \u201clisted at the Durand-Ruel gallery under the title Portrait of Tronquette\u201d (Inscrit galerie Durand-Ruel, sous le titre: Portrait de Tronquette); not only does this seem to be a misspelling of the name Trognette, it is not clear whether or when this work could have been with Durand-Ruel (perhaps the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 authors intended Bernheim-Jeune?). See Paul Jamot, George Wildenstein Manet, with Marie-Louise Bataille, vol. 1 (Les Beaux-Arts, \u00c9dition d\u2019\u00e9tudes et de documents, 1932), p. 161, no. 334.\n\nThe author of these lines identified himself only as an ex-anarchist and a friend of Ortiz; \u201cLes Anarchistes,\u201d Le Radical (Mar. 6, 1894), n.p.: \u201cC\u2019\u00e9tait . . . une toute mignonne petite femme, pale, gracieuse et avenant.

Scott Allan, Emily A. Beeny, and Gloria Groom, exh. cat. (J. Paul Getty Museum/Art Institute of Chicago, 2019).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV (ultraviolet), etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis of the signature area suggests that the main colorant is cobalt blue. Other pigments, including lead white, zinc white, iron oxides, emerald green, and Naples yellow, were also detected but all of these pigments were also detected in the background adjacent to the signature, making it difficult to determine which pigments were included in the paint mixture for the signature. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_WRead\\_33\\_435\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 31, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe canvas fibers were not analyzed.\n\nThe original dimensions were based on measurement of the edges of the composition. When the painting was lined, the canvas was restretched on a slightly larger stretcher than the original, resulting in a border of unpainted ground around the edges (see Conservation History).\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The small discrepancy between the painting\u2019s current dimensions and the standard sizeis probably a result of restretching the painting on a new, slightly larger stretcher after lining.\n\nSee Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: \u00c9douard Manet, Woman Reading (W313/1933.435),\u201d Oct. 2012.\n\nThe original canvas back is now obscured by the lining canvas. No evidence of the stamp was visible when the painting was examined with transmitted-light imaging.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination and treatment report, Sept. 20, 1964, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer could not be confirmed by cross-sectional analysis.\n\nThe ground was analyzed using SEM/EDX (scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and XRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy). Some dark particles were observed both in the cross sections and when the surface of the painting was examined microscopically; in addition, traces of iron were detected by XRF, which could be an indication of the presence of trace amounts of iron-oxide pigments. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanReading\\_1933\\_435\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 25, 2014; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_WRead\\_33\\_435\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 31, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe bottom part of this bar in the final painting seems slightly misaligned with the top part (i.e., placed slightly too far to the left), whereas some of the underlying brushstrokes seem better aligned with the top of the bar.\n\nA similar treatment of the edges was observed in Manet\u2019s Fish (Still Life) (cat. 2) and Sea View, Calm Weather (Vue de mer, temps calme) (cat. 3), and has further been documented in his Still-Life with Asparagus, c. 1880, in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud. It was suggested in the latter example that the purpose may have been to \u201ctest the effect of the composition or to suggest a pale frame.\u201d See Iris Schaefer, \u201cEdouard Manet\u2014Still Life with Asparagus, Brief Report on Technology and Condition,\u201d in Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpressionism (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, 2008), http://www.museenkoeln.de/impressionismus/abb/gross/18\\_e.pdf.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, zinc white, Naples yellow, iron oxides, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, XRF); cadmium yellow, ultramarine blue (SEM/EDX); red lake (madder and cochineal) (SERS); and vermilion, bone black (XRF). SEM/EDX analysis of the red lake detected major amounts of aluminum along with minor quantities of sulfur and trace levels of calcium and/or tin, all of which are commonly detected as part of a red-lake substrate. On the other hand, some individual red-lake particles were found to contain only aluminum and sulfur, clearly suggesting an aluminum-sulfate type of substrate. The presence of two different types of substrates may be explained and supported by the fact that two different dyestuffs (madder and cochineal) were identified by SERS (surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy). It is not possible to unambiguously associate each dyestuff with a specific substrate using the technology currently available; however, in the literature, tin-containing substrates typically have been connected with carmine (cochineal) pigments, while aluminum sulfate seems to have been used more commonly for madder. See Jo Kirby, Marika Spring, and Catherine Higgitt, \u201cThe Technology of Red Lake Pigment Manufacture: Study of the Dyestuff Substrate,\u201d National Gallery Technical Bulletin 26 (2005), pp. 71\u201387. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanReading\\_1933\\_435\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 25, 2014; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_WRead\\_33\\_435\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 31, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Manet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Manet paintings in other collections.
