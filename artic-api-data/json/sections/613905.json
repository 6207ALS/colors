Robinson, 1949.428\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Colorless, slightly greenish glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rounded rim is in-turned and spreads down into a deep, hemispherical vessel on a short stem with a pushed-in base ring with a pontil mark. The foot is slightly irregular on the underside; there is a thin, delicate trail wound around the center of the vessel exterior seven or eight times. For a zoomable image, see fig. 133.1.\n\nBroken and repaired, the goblet is heavily pitted with a thick, dark weathering crust flaking away to reveal brilliant golden iridescence.\n\nThe size of this drinking vessel is unparalleled. There are many related forms but several examples would fit into the bowl of this goblet. Although the closest parallels are found in Egypt, the weathering product on this goblet suggests that it was made elsewhere or it was made in Egypt and subsequently shipped to the northern or eastern provinces.\n\nThere are small examples of this form excavated at Karanis in Egypt and additional ones noted in the Cairo Museum. There are many related footed goblets in collections, for example in the Princeton University Art Museum; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; as well as one formerly in the Erwin Oppenl\u00e4nder collection in Waiblingen, near Stuttgart.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Harden, Roman Glass from Karanis, pp. 171\u201372, nos. 482\u201387, pl.
