Drawn from Art Institute Trustee and accomplished photographer Barbara Levy Kipper\u2019s sweeping collection of Asian jewelry and ritual objects, the exhibition presents 300 exquisitely crafted works of art that present a panoramic view of the nomadic peoples and ethnic minorities of Asia whose cultures, history, and artistic production deeply inspired Kipper\u2014and will continue to inspire and educate future generations, honoring Kipper\u2019s tremendous generosity and vision, when they join the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection.   >Open from June 19 to August 21, 2016 in the Regenstein Galleries, Vanishing Beauty will feature highlights from Kipper\u2019s expansive, diverse, and thoughtfully assembled collection of Tibetan and greater Himalayan Buddhist ritual objects and adornments, silver jewelry from the nomadic tribes of Turkmenistan and the city-states of Uzbekistan, tribal and folk jewelry from across South Asia, personal ornaments from the Indonesian archipelago, and the monumental jewelry of southwest China\u2019s ethnic minorities. The exhibition provides a unique opportunity to celebrate these objects and the diverse and global cultures in which they originally found their home.   >The exhibition\u2019s accompanying catalogue, published by the Art Institute and distributed by Yale University Press, features a lead essay by Madhuvanti Ghose, Alsdorf Associate Curator of Indian, Southeast Asian, Himalayan and Islamic Art, and beautifully illustrated plates highlighting Kipper\u2019s own photography exploring the significance of the collection and the objects comprising it, bringing to life Kipper\u2019s philanthropic ambition to preserve these remarkable objects at the Art Institute and share them with museum visitors from around the world.   >   align=\"center\"> # # #   Sponsors Vanishing Beauty: Asian Jewelry and Ritual Objects from the Barbara and David Kipper Collection is generously sponsored by Barbara Levy Kipper and the Kipper Family Foundation.
