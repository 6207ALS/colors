    "description": "<p>Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has become recognized for socially conscious projects involving the innovative use of materials such as paper tubes. To create the 10-Unit System, Ban applied modular design and recyclable materials. Similar to his paper-tube constructions, Ban developed a system of identical parts that can be arranged in multiple configurations. A range of pieces\u2014including a chair, a table, and a bench\u2014can be created through the simple L-shaped component made from a paper-plastic composite. The furniture is easy to assemble and disassemble, providing maximum flexibility for the user.</p>\n",
