    "title": "Manet and the Sea",
    "description": "This landmark exhibition is devoted to the marine paintings of Edouard Manet (1832\u20131883), a little-studied but highly significant aspect of the career of the artist who is sometimes referred to as the father of Impressionism. Taking Manet\u2019s seascapes\u2014ranging from 1864 to shortly before his death in 1883\u2014as a point of departure, the exhibition traces the complex interactions that link the artist to his immediate predecessors and contemporaries, including Gustave Courbet, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, and James McNeill Whistler, among others. Manet and the Sea brings together innovative works on sea-related themes by a variety of artists with differing ambitions. At the same time, it addresses emergent sociohistorical phenomena, especially the increase of tourism, which made the sea newly attractive to artists in the second half of the 19th century.",
