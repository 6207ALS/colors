This drawing sheet is characteristic of Marion Mahoney\u2019s unique hybrid com- positions for architectural plans, combining floor plan, sections, and elevation in a highly decorative yet legible way. Throughout the drawing, lush vegetation weaves in and out of stonework, proposing a building fully engaged with the surrounding landscape of Toowoomba, a famous garden city. The gently curving building was organized around a central courtyard with a covered cloister for shaded walking and trellis to support flowering vines that gives access to the building\u2019s rooms for dining and recreation.</p>\n",
