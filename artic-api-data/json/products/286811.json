The work\u2019s early date is reinforced by the thickly applied paint, which is so different from the thin washes of pigments that the artist would use in his canvases in the 1880s and 1890s.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 42 in diameter when open, 11 x 2.5 inches closed.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong> 100% Polyester</li><li><strong>Auto open, comes with sleeve for storage.</strong></li></ul>",
