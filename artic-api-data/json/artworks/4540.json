    "description": "<p>Geller\u2019s <em>Yiddish Motifs</em> portfolio depicts scenes of Jewish identity and daily life in a series of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=yiddish&artist_ids=Todros+Geller\">seven woodcuts</a> printed on Japanese wood veneer paper, an unusual paper choice, given that it was typically used for decorative purposes. Maxwell Street was a predominantly Jewish neighborhood on the city\u2019s Near West Side, known for its large outdoor bazaar, sadly dismantled in the 1990s by development. These prints show a crowded marketplace, a vendor at work, a student in deep concentration, and a pair of street musicians. The <em>Yiddish Motifs</em> portfolio was a great success, with the entire edition selling out in just three weeks.</p>\n",
