    "description": "<p>If not for the fog, Claude Monet once remarked, \u201cLondon wouldn\u2019t be a beautiful city. It\u2019s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth.\u201d While working on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\">London series</a>, he rose early every day to paint Waterloo Bridge in the morning, moving on to Charing Cross Bridge at midday and in the afternoon. He observed both motifs from his fifth-floor window at the Savoy Hotel. The Art Institute\u2019s two Waterloo Bridge paintings are dated 1900 and 1903, but both were likely begun in 1900 and dated only when Monet felt that they were finished. He worked on all of his London paintings in his studio in Giverny, refusing to send any of them to his dealer until he was satisfied with them as an ensemble.</p>\n",
