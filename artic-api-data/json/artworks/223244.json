    "description": "<p>Defined by Tigerman as \u201cAn Edenic Myth / Denied,\u201d this drawing of Berlin examines the symbolic and formal relationship of West Berlin and East Berlin. Stemming from ideas in this drawing, the Berlin Wall Project was developed prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, for a competition commemorating Berlin\u2019s 750th anniversary. Here Tigerman aimed to integrate the wall into the urban fabric of Berlin and reconnect its disjointed halves. Formally, the division of the city resembles the cleaving Tigerman has used throughout his career. Highlighted by a procession of trees, the bifurcation of the city is left intact in order to retain the Cold War\u2019s indelible effect. Making an analogy between the biblical explusion of Adam from Eden to the rise of the wall in 1961, Tigerman\u2019s design retains a physical memory of the city\u2019s conflict yet begins the healing process via passageways connecting East with West. As with Eden before the Fall, for Tigerman there is no going back to Berlin before the wall: the wound of 1961 is irreparable.</p>\n",
