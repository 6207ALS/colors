    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In a rocky grotto, the classical hero Hercules faces the monstrous Lernean Hydra, which he must kill as one of his 12 labors. Around the Hydra are strewn the gruesome remains of its previous victims. The painting is by Gustave Moreau, who chose to depict the moment of absolute calm and stillness before the fight begins. Moreau reinforced this feeling by placing a long view out to the calm sea between the opponents. Former Director, Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: His attempt was not only to suggest the two opposing figures, but to also suggest the two opposing principles, the forces of light represented by this figure of Hercules who was almost depicted like the Sun God Apollo, and the forces of darkness which are suggested by not only the gloomy surround in which this combat takes place, but also these black snakes that one sees in the form of the Hydra. This place in Lerna where the battle takes place was the gateway to the Netherworld, so it really is about light versus dark, good versus evil, and of course, Hercules will prevail.</p>\n",
