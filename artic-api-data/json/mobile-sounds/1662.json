This pair of small beakers shows the extraordinary talents of metalwork artists from the Inca Empire.  At the time of the Spanish Conquest in 1532, the Inca reigned over some 10 million people from their capital Cuzco, in modern-day Peru.  Made from hammered gold, the beakers feature raised motifs that include a flock of birds in a stylized field of corn or maize.  The Inca rulers claimed descent from the sun god, Inti, who was symbolized by gold, a rare material that was considered sacred.  The ownership, display, and use of gold objects were restricted to Inca royalty and the uppermost elite.  Tumbler-shaped vessels like these were typically made in matched pairs.  They were used during royal feasting ceremonies to drink and made toasts with corn beer, as well as to offer ritual libations to the ancestors, supernatural beings, and the sacred powers of the natural world.  The Art Institute's extensive holdings of ancient art from the Andes Mountains were principally formed in the mid-1950s, with the purchase of over 1000 ceramics, textiles and metal works, including these gold beakers.  They were formerly from the collection of Dr. Edward Gaffron, who lived in Lima, Peru, from 1892 to 1912.</p>\n",
