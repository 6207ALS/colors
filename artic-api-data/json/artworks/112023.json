    "description": "<p><em>The Liber Studiorum</em> (<em>Book of Studies</em>) served as both a testament to Joseph Mallord William Turner\u2019s achievement as a painter and an instruction manual for other artists. As opposed to artists who commissioned professional printmakers to reproduce their paintings, Turner made his etchings, and even some of his mezzotints, himself. He was involved in the entire process, making sure that each print measured up to his standards. The variations in line and shading expertly display the range and variety of atmospheric effects that a landscape painter can achieve, an impressive accomplishment for Turner.</p>\n",
