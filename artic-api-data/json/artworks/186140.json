They referred to their practice of painting rocks and dropping them from a loft window onto the busy street below as \u201cDrop Art.\u201d\n\nBy 1965 the founders\u2019 desire to live rent free and create art without the distraction of employment led them to a six-acre goat pasture outside Trinidad, Colorado, which they purchased for $450. Naming their community after their gravity-driven art was the easy part; building it was a little harder. But having recently attended a lecture by Buckminster Fuller and now joined by a would-be dome builder from Albuquerque, they began with scrap materials and visionary optimism. Sheet metal was stripped off car roofs (for which they paid a nickel or a dime) and attached to the grid of a dome. These building materials not only provided shelter, but they also emblemized the group\u2019s refusal to participate in consumerist society. Money, clothing and cars were shared, and they lived as quasi-dumpster divers.\n\nInitially the community flourished. With a core group of twelve, it functioned as the founders had intended, a hotbed of art-making. But a steady flow of publicity in underground and mainstream media, encouraged by resident Peter Rabbit, led to a torrent of guests. It has been reported that Bob Dylan, Timothy Leary and Jim Morrison visited, but the historian\u2019s chestnut, the primary account, may be less than reliable when it comes to the 1960s. By the time the community decided to abandon its open-door policy, it was too late: the founding members had left, and conditions had taken hold that would bring about a final dissolution in 1973. In 1978 the site was sold; proceeds helped rent space in New York City for exhibitions of the group\u2019s work and to publish it in Crisscross magazine.\n\nThe domes sat on the land of A. Blasi and Sons Trucking Company until recently, when they succumbed to gravity.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
