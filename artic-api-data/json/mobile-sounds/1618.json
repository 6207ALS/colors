    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In a calm, Arcadian landscape bathed in golden light the nine muses, or classical patronesses of the arts gather in the sacred grove. The muses are crowned with leaves from the grove\u2019s laurel trees and their decorous poses epitomize the balance and harmony they inspire in the arts. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes made the painting in the 1880s as a scaled down version of a mural he designed for a museum entry hall. Puvis worked at the same time as the impressionists and yet his approach to art was profoundly different. Rather than depicting modern subjects with experimental techniques Puvis drew on the classical themes and techniques of ancient Roman and renaissance Italian frescoes, or wall paintings. Following their example, he eliminated bright colors and strong contrasts of light and dark in favor of a limited range of chalky colors, muted tones, and flattened forms. Although Puvis looked back to the past for inspiration, avant-garde artists such as Gauguin and Seurat very much admired his paintings with their flat zones of color and shadowless, slightly mysterious figures who express themselves through ritualistic gesture.</p>\n",
