    "description": "<p><em>The Lone Boat, North Woods Club, Adirondacks</em> speaks powerfully of the fisherman\u2019s communion with nature. The medium of <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#watercolor\">watercolor</a> offered the perfect metaphor as well as technical means to express this relationship; its very wetness allows the forms of man and nature to run together, absorbed by the hazy atmosphere. In <em>The Lone Boat</em>, Homer constructed a nearly abstract composition along a strong horizon line, with the trees on the shore and their reflections in the water forming a symmetrical design. The effect is similar to that achieved when a still-wet sheet is folded at the center and blotted.</p>\n<p>Homer painted the sky using multiple hues and a complex array of techniques, including <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#resist\">resist</a>, blotting, scraping, and wet-into-wet brushwork. The resulting textures and contrasts create a strong sense of movement, of clouds accumulating and dispersing while light shifts and changes across their forms.</p>\n",
