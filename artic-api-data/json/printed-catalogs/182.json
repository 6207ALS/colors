    "copy": " One of the most exciting designers working today, Max Lamb (b. 1980) has received international acclaim for his innovative experiments with materials, craft, and technology. Drawn to the form of the chair and its relationship to the human body, Lamb has explored many different inventive outcomes in his ever-evolving Exercises in Seating project. This book investigates over a decade of creative practice with a focus on his interest in seating\u2014from stone thrones to wood chairs and enameled-steel stools. In Lamb\u2019s own words, \u201cA seat is very simple in function, but very complex in the many different characters, forms, and ideas it can express.\u201d Both retrospective and forward looking, this volume\u2014created in collaboration with the artist\u2014is the most thorough investigation of Lamb\u2019s work to date and features an exclusive interview with noted artist Ryan Gander in which the designer discusses his creative processes and goals.
