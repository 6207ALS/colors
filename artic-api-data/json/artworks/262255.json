    "description": "<p>Inspired Partnerships was a Chicago-based non-profit group that helped over 200 religious congregations maintain their buildings, providing leadership training, information, and technical guidance to city congregations struggling with the realities of aging facilities. Inspired Partnerships was an outgrowth of a 1989 Endowment-sponsored initiative of the Midwest Office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Chicago and funded through the Lilly Endowment and the National Trust. In 1991 the initial demonstration project became an independent organization and took the name Inspired Partnerships until its dissolution in 1993.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Inspired%20Partnerships%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Inspired%20Partnerships%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
