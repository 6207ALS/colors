    "description": "<p>These twelve drawings depict scenes from the French novel </em>The Adventures of Telemachus (Les aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque)</em> by Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon. First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.<br>Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer\u2019s <em>Odyssey</em>, the first four books of which describe the hero\u2019s search for his father. F\u00e9nelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality F\u00e9nelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.<br>Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1\u20138 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.</p>\n<p>Shipwrecked after many adventures, Telemachus is washed ashore on the island of Calypso, where his father, Ulysses, had been held unwillingly for seven years and has only recently departed. As she had with Ulysses, Calypso develops a passion for Telemachus. In this scene, he relates his adventures to the goddess and her court of nymphs.</p>\n",
