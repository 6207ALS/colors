Matisse / 42 (lower left, in graphite)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, David Adler Collection, 1950.1414\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this head of a woman directly with bold, firmly placed crayon lines on ivory wove paper. He constructed the form using distinct lines varying in length. Long, continuous marks surround and define her face while one continuous line defines chin, profile, eyebrow, and nose and another establishes her wavy hair and frames the left side of the face. The solid wax crayon yielded lines of uniform width and color. The crayon picked up the fine screen texture from the paper surface; this is especially evident in the undulating mark defining the trim on the blouse sleeve at lower left (see fig. 49.1). There are pinholes at both upper corners, likely indicating Matisse drew with the paper tacked to a board or that he pinned the drawing to the wall after it was completed.\n\nSigned: H. Matisse / 42 (lower left, in graphite) (fig. 49.2).\n\nBlack crayon.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left edges have an imitation deckle edge, indicating that the paper is moldmade. The paper remains unchanged from the original manufactured dimensions. There is a fine screen pattern, more prominent on the verso (fig. 49.3) than on the recto, evident in raking light. There is a watermark located near the top of the right edge: Arches (see fig. 49.4).\n\n52.8 \u00d7 40.8 cm (20 5/8 \u00d7 16 in.).\n\nThis drawing was once perimeter mounted to a secondary support. There is no record in the curatorial nor conservation files indicating whether this drawing arrived at the museum in 1950 on a mount, and there is no information to indicate when it was released from the secondary support. When the secondary support was removed, adhesive along the perimeter on the verso was left in place.\n\nThis drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2008 to address severe distortions, discoloration, surface soil, and skinning (see fig. 49.5). At that time it was surface cleaned along the top and right edge, avoiding media, to reduce surface soil and accretions. An amylase poultice was used to reduce dense starch adhesive from the edges of the verso. The sheet was briefly blotter washed to rinse out residual adhesive and reduce sheet discoloration. Small skinned spots on the edges of the verso were filled with a sympathetic Japanese paper adhered with methylcellulose. The drawing was humidified and flattened.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition. There is minor surface soil along the top edge. Along the perimeter of the sheet, there is a one-centimeter-wide band that appears brighter and whiter than the interior of the sheet. This is because a thick adhesive application on the verso prevented the edges from having contact with deleterious materials in a mount which darkened the interior of the sheet. The sheet displays minor undulations in raking light. Raking light also reveals a planar distortion along the edges at the boundary where dense adhesive was once applied.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Martin Fabiani, by Apr. 1950.\n\nExchanged with Bernheim-Jeune, Apr. 1950\u2013June 20, 1950.\n\nSold to Carl Schniewind as a representative of the members of the David Adler Memorial Fund, Chicago, June 20, 1950\u2013Oct. 20, 1950.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago on behalf of the David Adler Memorial Fund, Oct. 20, 1950.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse, Nov. 13, 1951\u2013Jan. 13, 1952; Cleveland Museum of Art, Feb. 5\u2013Mar. 16, 1952; Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 1\u2013May 4, 1952, addendum to catalogue, no cat. no., as Head of a Girl, (1942); San Francisco Museum of Art, May 22\u2013July 6, 1952 (probably Chicago only).\n\nStuttgart, Staatsgalerie, Henri Matisse: Zeichnungen und Gouaches D\u00e9coup\u00e9es, Dec. 11, 1993\u2013Feb. 20, 1994, cat. 38 (ill.), as Tete [sic] d\u2019une femme/Kopf einer Frau, 1942.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Institute of Chicago, addendum (Art Institute of Chicago, 1952), now bound into Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse, exh. cat., introduction by Alfred H.
