His associate, John Henry Dearle, took them and added a vertical element in the fruit tree trunks to create the pattern Orchard. It is reminiscent of wall hangings designed by Dearle and Morris' younger daughter, May, in the late 1890's. Ships nicely boxed and ready for gifting.</span></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 1.5 in.</li><li><strong>Materials: </strong>solid brass, giclee print, hand gilded faux gold, ear wires are gold plated<strong><br></strong></li></ul>",
