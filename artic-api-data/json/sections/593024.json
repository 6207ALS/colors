While the group of three hexagonal mold-blown bottles (cats. 105\u2013107) illustrates the variation of color and design within a single form, these contemporary vessels show how the glassmakers employed delicate and precise decorative elements to create a wide variety of design on numerous inventive forms. The bottle with heads (cat. 108) appears to be a unique example of this type of decoration, while the small jug (cat. 109) is defined by a register with delicate tendrils and elegant form that may suggest that it was produced at one of the major glass factories in Sidon. The bottle in the shape of a date (cat. 110) is far more popular and is commonly preserved in the yellow-brown color of the fruit it represents. There are a few examples of this form blown in green or deep-blue glass. All of these small vessels were containers for precious liquids, probably scented oils that were shipped throughout the empire.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Three mold-blown vessels, from left: Bottle, 1st century A.D.
