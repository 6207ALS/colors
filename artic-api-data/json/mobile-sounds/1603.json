    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Leaning gracefully against her hand and letting her book slip into her lap, this woman seems lost in thought. A solitary, contemplative woman was a popular theme among early nineteenth century romantic artists. It allowed the artists to give a sense of the subject\u2019s intellect and imagination while also focusing on her beauty and her pose. This image is by Camille Corot, best known for his poetic landscapes. Late in his career he began to make figure paintings such as this one. The painting\u2019s luminosity recalls the silvery light of his earlier landscapes. Here Corot restricts his palette to a narrow range of warm browns and whites set off by the woman\u2019s dark hair and vivid red beads. Although Corot\u2019s subject may be more traditional his technique is often breathtakingly free and modern. The highlights in folds of the woman\u2019s skirt for instance are described with broad sweeps of paint. Corot\u2019s bold handling of paint recalls that of his younger artist friends, the impressionists, who were transforming French art right around the same time.</p>\n",
