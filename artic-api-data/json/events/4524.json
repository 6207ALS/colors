    "description": "<p><em>DEAD TIME</em>&nbsp;is a 63-page score, which sits at the heart of Cally Spooner\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"/exhibitions/9225/dead-time\" target=\"_blank\">exhibition</a>. The score consists of drawings, photos, captions of recent work, fan mail, as well as references to various living and non-human elements. For this performance, these elements enter and exit the gallery according to their own duration, repertoires, and speeds, then collide, over the course of an hour.</p><p>During the run of the exhibition, April 22\u2013April 28, <a href=\"/search/events?q=cally+spooner\" target=\"_blank\">performances</a> will occur daily 3:30\u20134:30, with one additional performance on Thursday, April 25, 6:30\u20137:30. Space is limited for these performances, and registration is required.</p><p><em>DEAD TIME </em>is the second installment of <a href=\"/exhibitions/9252/iterations\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Iterations</em></a>, a series of new performance commissions at the Art Institute of Chicago. <em>Iterations</em> is made possible through the generous support of the Society of Contemporary Art. <em>DEAD TIME </em>is commissioned by the Art Institute of Chicago in partnership with the Swiss Institute, New York, and the Centre National de la Danse, Paris.</p><h3><strong>Artist's and Performers' Biographies</strong></h3><p>Through installations, writing, and performance, <strong>Cally Spooner</strong> stages absurdist replays of the political, economic, and media rhetoric of our time to reflect on the patriarchal order that controls it. In doing so, she reveals the ways in which contemporary subjectivity and the human body are subject to continuous changes dictated by technological and economic conditions. Her exhibitions and performances are anchored to feminist philosophical processes which physically, acoustically, and conceptually incorporate duration, erosion, maintenance, rehearsal, and collapse as practices of resistance. These strategies are adopted in opposition to sudden fluctuations in global markets, to the unstoppable flow of digital data, and to the imperative demand for performance and productivity.</p><p>Spooner was born in 1983; she lives and works in Athens, Greece.
