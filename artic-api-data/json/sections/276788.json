Wearing the \u201cwinged hat\u201d that gave the first portrait its title, Ethel is here shown at nearly full length, holding a pair of long gloves. Whistler painted a number of standing portraits of his sister-in-law, several of which relate to this lithograph. Harmony in Brown: The Felt Hat of around 1891 (fig. 35a [YMSM 395]) is, in pose and costume, especially close to the print.\n\nBy manipulating several lithographic crayons, Whistler achieved a range of subtle tonalities and a convincing sense of the figure\u2019s plasticity in Gants de su\u00e8de. These qualities were most fully realized in the impressions Thomas Way printed by hand from the original stone. An early proof in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, suggests that Whistler may have considered developing the image as a color lithograph. This impression, bearing registration marks 21 mm above and 33 below the figure, was extensively worked over by the artist with colored pencils. The work was probably done at the time he also colored the proof of Drury Lane Rags (cat. 25), now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. Both touched proofs are clearly experiments Whistler made when planning his first color lithograph with the Ways. In the end, he did not choose either subject, and instead began his first color project, Figure Study in Colors (cat. 39), with a new transfer drawing.\n\nWhistler seems to have been pleased with both The Winged Hat and Gants de su\u00e8de. When he was approached by Gleeson White in December 1893 about the publication of one of his lithographs in The Studio, an art magazine which had been launched the previous April, Whistler agreed to let the journal have \u201cthe second drawing I did from my sister in law . . . the one standing with a pair of gloves drawn out in the two hands\u201d (letter 69). Whistler received ten guineas as payment for the publication rights; The Studio also hoped to obtain fifty additional proofs beyond the periodical edition, but Whistler flatly refused. Gants de su\u00e9de was printed by the Way firm from retransfers, and appeared as a special feature in The Studio on 16 April 1894 with the announcement \u201cWith an Auto-lithograph \u2018Gants de Suede\u2019 by J. McN. Whistler.\u201d\n\nT. R. Way\u2019s tally of impressions seems to be too low. The Fine Art Society ordered twenty impressions of Gants de su\u00e8de from Way for their 1895-96 exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. In addition, correspondence with the Ways records six impressions sent to Paris during May 1892 and eight on 12 February 1894 (letter 34 and letter 82).\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (257 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; cream laid paper (280 \u00d7 199 mm); MWC, tan laid paper (313 \u00d7 201 mm). Glasgow: HAG (5), cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; ivory wove proofing paper (342 \u00d7 259 mm), hand colored with blue, pink, yellow, peach, and orange pencils, with registration marks; cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 208 mm), signed; cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; ivory wove proofing paper (341 \u00d7 203 mm), with registration marks.

Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (318 \u00d7 205 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (311 \u00d7 211 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA; Cincinnati, CAM; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.\n\nPublished edition. The image was retransferred from the original stone to supplementary stones and machine printed by Way for The Studio. The periodical edition was printed on medium-weight, cream wove paper with a smooth surface recto and a finely textured surface verso; the paper has often darkened to a buff or tan. There are very slight losses in the impressions made from the retransfers, and the finest lines in the image have broadened and lost their definition. In addition, the ink used for the Studio edition appears blacker and shinier than that used for hand-printed impressions.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (295 \u00d7 210 mm), with blind stamp, rebound.

Beatrix Whistler referred to this lithograph by the title Mosquetaire in letter 34 and letter 111.\n\nAnother oil portrait, Rose et argent: La Jolie Mutine (YMSM 389; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), although never conclusively identified as Ethel, seems to depict the same woman who posed for Gants de su\u00e8de. Dated \u201cabout 1890\u201d (Young et al. (1980), p. 173, no. 389), the oil employs the same pose, device of the suede gloves, and sidelong glance as the lithograph. In addition, the two sitters share similar facial features and physical bearing. The secondary titles Whistler used for the lithograph and the oil, Mosquetaire and La Jolie Mutine respectively, also indicate in both cases an affectionate and jesting familiarity in his relationship to the model.\n\nWhistler sent proofs of both subjects to St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 in Paris. In an undated letter written sometime between 28 September and 5 October 1890, the poet responded: \u201c J\u2019ai re\u00e7u les deux portraits; vraiment, l\u2019un est plus agr\u00e9able que l\u2019autre\u201d (\u201cI have received the two portraits; truly, one is even more beautiful than the other\u201d); Barbier (1964), p. 67, no. XXXIX.\n\nSee letter 40.\n\nWhistler to Gleeson White, 18 January 1894, FGA 184; and letter 74, letter 75, and letter 76.\n\nThe issue included two short essays on lithography under the title \u201cSome Remarks on Artistic Lithography\u201d written by William Rothenstein and T. R. Way. A brief discussion of transfer lithography was included (p. 19).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 35, only state.
