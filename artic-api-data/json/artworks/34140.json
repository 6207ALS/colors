    "description": "<p>Lucien Clergue made most of his photographs\u2014principally nudes, portraits of artists, landscapes, and images of bull-fighting\u2014close to his native home of Arles. Like his friend and mentor Pablo Picasso, Clergue had long been fascinated by the rituals of bullfighting, which combined grace and art with violence and danger. He began photographing the great bullfighter and Spanish popular hero known as El Cordob\u00e9s in 1963, soon publishing a book that showcased the matador\u2019s theatrical style. In 1970 Hugh Edwards acquired six of Clergue\u2019s photographs, and that summer he mounted an exhibition on the artist. This photograph, taken from a ground-level position that emphasizes the bull\u2019s seeming anguish over the man\u2019s exertions, was showcased on the exhibition\u2019s printed announcement.</p>\n",
