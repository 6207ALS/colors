    "description": "<p>At the turn of the 19th century, conflict arose between the United States of America and the North African Barbary State of Tripoli. President Thomas Jefferson refused to continue to pay tribute or ransom to Tripoli to prevent the pirating of American merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. Jefferson dispatched the American ship <em>Enterprise</em> to the Tripolitan waters as a sign of resistance just as Tripoli increased its tribute demands and declared war against the United States. Thomas Birch, an early specialist in maritime painting, captured the battle between the <em>Enterprise</em> and a Tripolitan cruiser in the Mediterranean\u2019s dark, violent waters. The break in the clouds sheds light on this conflict and illuminates Birch\u2019s fine details and precise rendering of these ships.</p>\n",
