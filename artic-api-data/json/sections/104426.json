After this particular folio was removed from its sketchbook and drawn on, it was mounted to a canvas support that has since been removed. During the mounting process, adhesive was brushed onto the back of the sheet, causing physical changes on the front of the paper. When Ensor added bright-blue chalk to enhance the sky, it accumulated along the high points formed by the adhesive strokes. This created a series of fine, diagonal, sweeping lines in the lower area of the sheet, perpendicular to the drawing lines. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Folio 1A/B.
