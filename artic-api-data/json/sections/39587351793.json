The figure at the left sleeps on her side, her proper left arm lying heavily across her torso. The woman at the right, on the other hand, sits or stands upright, her eyes casting what could be read as a somewhat wary glance to the left. Resembling many figures in Gauguin\u2019s art, the two figures may relate to images in a portfolio of studies Gauguin completed during his first trip to Tahiti (1891\u201393) known as Documents Tahiti: 1891, 1892, 1893. Sheets from this group (see fig. 41.2) exhibit similar handling (the use of strong contour lines, for example) and feature the same model, probably Gauguin\u2019s young lover Tehamana, who appears often in his works from that time (see cats. 50 and 49, verso). The major difference is that the present drawing is on parchment, not paper. Gauguin used parchment for other drawings, perhaps because it is stronger and more durable than paper and he wished to ensure that he could handle such sketches in the future, including employing them to produce other works (see cat. 44).\n\nIn 1988 Charles F. Stuckey noted that the sleeping woman in the present sheet could be understood as a \u201charbinger of his [Gauguin\u2019s] goal to express the Tahitians\u2019 experience of their dream world,\u201d an aspiration that resulted in the late 1892 painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 41.3 [W 457]). The other female figure, viewed frontally, appears in a similar form on the verso of a second drawing in the Art Institute (fig. 41.4 [cat. 46, verso]), which may have been traced from this one. In particular, the facial features of the woman in the present sheet are more clearly depicted. The irises of her eyes are strongly articulated, accentuating her intense, sideways gaze, which directs attention to the female on the left. While figures in these particular poses are not similarly juxtaposed in any finished painting, their placement here does not seem arbitrary. Instead, the drawing appears to have been composed in order to portray the sleeping and waking states of the subject.\n\nThe upper-right-hand corner of the drawing features a graphite sketch of a traditional Marquesan ear ornament, or taiana. The fact that it is in graphite rather than ink could indicate that it was drawn at a different moment from the images of the women. Gauguin had a keen interest in native Polynesian and Maori art and religion even before he departed on his first trip to Tahiti in 1891. He likely had seen objects from this part of the world in displays of Oceanic art. For example, taiana were among the objects exhibited in the Palais des Colonies at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris. The lack of native art he found in Tahiti, which had been transformed by colonization, was a great disappointment to him. Gauguin believed that age-old native practices and artifacts could still be found on the more remote Marquesas Islands, which fed his interest in such items as the earplug seen here. In addition to his fascination with indigenous religion, art, and culture, the artist was drawn to the geometric patterns embellishing objects such as taiana. He wrote, \u201cPeople in Europe do not seem to realize that both the Maoris of New Zealand and the Marquesans had evolved a very advanced type of decorative art. . . . The Marquesans especially have an extraordinary sense of decoration.\u201d This was not the only instance in which the artist depicted a taiana; he also drew the side view of another one (fig. 41.5).\n\nAnother reason to attribute this sketch of an earplug to a different time from that of the two female figures is that the former likely has no symbolic connection with the latter. The association of Tahitian women and taiana is dubious, as they were worn only by Marquesan women and were sought-after Marquesan family heirlooms. Originally carved from the bones of the dead, these objects were connected to the pre-Christian Marquesan cult of ancestors.\n\nGauguin was intrigued that traditional religious images such as tiki (carved representations of gods or ancestors) were incorporated into Marquesan designs. Scholars have noted that Gauguin reproduced the pattern of the earplug depicted on the present sheet in an 1892 canvas, Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (fig. 41.6 [W 483]). The fence stretching across the landscape replicates the ornament\u2019s designs exactly, including as well traditional tiki heads decorating the top of the fence. While stone tiki heads appeared in the low walls of Marquesan cult platforms, there seems to be no precedent for the design of the fence in Parahi te marae. As Dario Gamboni argued, this is another instance of Gauguin\u2019s creative appropriation of preexisting motifs in his work.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Richard H.

The Marquesan earplug motif appears in a fence in the foreground of Gauguin\u2019s 1892 oil painting Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (Philadelphia Museum of Art [W 483]). This is also one of several drawings on parchment in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (see cats. 39, 40, and 42), which Gauguin produced during his first Tahitian trip (1891\u201393).\n\nThe portfolio\u2019s contents were exhibited and sold at the Galerie Marcel Guiot, Paris, in 1942. See Galerie Marcel Guiot, Exposition Gauguin: Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, preface by Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, exh. cat. (Galerie Marcel Guiot, 1942). The contents were augmented by Gauguin over the years, which makes it impossible to determine what the portfolio originally contained in 1891/93.\n\nCharles F.
