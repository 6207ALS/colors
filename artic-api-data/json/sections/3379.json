Delaney Fund, 2010.2\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse printed this monotype chine coll\u00e9 on a press he purchased in 1914. He used a subtractive technique that resulted in an inverse, white-on-black image. Working on a copperplate coated with an even layer of black printing ink, Matisse employed a sharp, pointed implement, like a drypoint needle, to \u201cdraw\u201d his composition. Moving the implement across the inked plate pushed medium aside, leaving lines devoid of ink. When printed, those lines revealed the white of the paper. The process allowed for a freedom of line very much akin to that of drawing but did not allow for error, as any disruption of the ink film would be recorded in the print. In the upper left quadrant Matisse made revisions to the rim of the cylindrical fishbowl and to the position of a plant leaf. He tamped out the lines he wished to eliminate using his fingertip to redistribute the ink and soften the marks. His fingerprint ridges are evident over remnants of the deleted lines (see fig. 22.1 and fig. 22.2). Partial fingerprints are also visible along the edges from handling the inked plate prior to printing (fig. 22.3).\n\nThe black ink was deposited in uneven horizontal bands across the image, most readily seen in specular light examination. The top 1 cm and lower 2 cm of ink printed darker than the rest of the image. This resulted from uneven pressure in the press.\n\nPrinting the monotype chine coll\u00e9 allowed marks of great delicacy and fineness to be recorded in the layer of smooth, soft, thin, China paper that would not have been achievable on a heavier European plate paper alone. As is typical for works printed chine coll\u00e9, the ivory wove plate paper supports the thin, grayish-ivory, image-bearing chine paper and serves as a visual framing element. In this monotype, the China paper extends over the beveled plate mark along the upper edge (fig. 22.4).\n\nInscribed and signed: Monotype/Henri-Matisse (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 22.5).\n\nMonotype in black ink, printed chine coll\u00e9.\n\nThe primary support is very thin, smooth, grayish-ivory China paper. This paper is identified as China paper due to its light weight, hue, and soft surface. By definition, China paper is used for the primary, image-bearing support in chine coll\u00e9. The sheet edges are straight cut.\n\nThe secondary support is thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper. This paper is a soft plate paper well suited to accepting the imprint of the copper plate. It is thick and strong and acts to support and frame the thin China paper upon which the ink sits. The chine coll\u00e9 was affixed to the smoother, felt side. The wire side (verso; fig. 22.6) bears a more pronounced screen pattern.\n\nThere is a partial impressed watermark along the top half of the left edge of the secondary support: A. LEPAGE AINE. TOCHON-LEPA (0.8 \u00d7 17.5 cm) (see fig. 22.7). The full watermark for this sheet reads: \u201cA. LEPAGE AINE TOCHON-LEPAGE SUCCR.\u201d The impressed watermark was pressed onto the damp sheet by means of rubber or metal matrix affixed to a dandy roll.\n\nImage/plate: 18 \u00d7 12.9 cm (7 1/16 \u00d7 5 1/16 in.); primary support: 17.7 \u00d7 12.5 cm (6 15/16 \u00d7 4 7/8 in.); secondary support: 37.5 \u00d7 28 cm (14 3/4 \u00d7 11 in.).\n\nThere is a 0.2 cm loss from the primary support, within the image, near the upper right corner. The area has been retouched with black ink. This may have occurred during printing and the printer may have retouched the loss. There is no record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.\n\nThere is slight yellowing along the edges of the secondary support from exposure to the atmosphere. In the bottom right corner there are two small stains. There are handling dents throughout and a crease that extends down the right side of the sheet. The largest handling dent appears along the left side of the sheet in the margin to the left of the image at the lower edge.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">The artist\u2019s son, Pierre Matisse (June 13, 1900\u2013Aug. 10, 1989), New York, by Nov. 3, 1954\u2013Aug. 10, 1989.\n\nBy descent to unidentified member of the Matisse family, Aug. 10, 1989\u2013Feb. 10, 2010.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 10, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, Mar. 20\u2013June 20, 2010, cats. 22t and 31d (ill.), as Still Life with Goldfish (V), 1914\u201315; New York, Museum of Modern Art, July 18\u2013Oct. 11, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Marguerite Duthuit-Matisse and Claude Duthuit, Henri Matisse: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9, with the collaboration of Fran\u00e7oise Garnaud, vol. 1 (C.
