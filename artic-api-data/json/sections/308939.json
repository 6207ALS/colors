She described it again on the following page as \u201cFourth untried stone. (Japanese robe).\u201d The entries clearly indicate that she used the designation \u201cuntried drawing\u201d for images drawn on stone that had never been printed during Whistler\u2019s lifetime.\n\nAlthough the dating of this image is not certain, it is likely to have been made at about the same time as another untried drawing, Draped Model, Standing (cat. 74), in November or December 1893. At this time Whistler was actively engaged in working with the stump on transfer paper and on stone. Like Draped Model, Standing, this image was probably drawn on one of the \u201ctwo or three stones\u201d that Whistler mentioned in a letter to the Ways on November 12 (letter 58). Because one of these stones proved unsuccessful when it was hand carried to London and printed by the Ways, Whistler probably set the others aside in his studio, believing that they would yield the same unsatisfactory results if printed.\n\nThe boldly patterned Japanese robe in The Draped Model, Standing by a Sofa is also depicted in at least three pastels, all in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow. In A Masked Woman (M 1225) it is worn by the model; in two other instances (M 1273, M 1274) it is draped over a Victorian sofa that resembles the one behind the model in this lithograph. The reuse of this vibrantly colored robe in a lithograph of this date might suggest that Whistler was contemplating the addition of color to the image. Of course, this possibility is purely speculative, although in a letter written to the Ways in October 1893, the artist mentioned the possibility of \u201chaving another go with colour in Wellington Street.\u201d At that time he was hard at work on color lithographs with the Parisian printer Belfond, until their collaboration was terminated by a falling out in late November or early December.\n\nChicago: SC, ivory laid paper (378 \u00d7 229 mm).
