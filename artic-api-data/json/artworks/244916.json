In the legendary origin story of ancient Rome, the city\u2019s founder Romulus and his men sought to establish families by abducting the neighboring Sabine women and forcing them to become their wives. When the vengeful Sabines declared war on the Romans, Romulus\u2019s wife and the other Sabine women threw themselves and their infants between the two armies and successfully stopped a war.</p>\n<p>The subject allowed Jacques-Louis David, who conceived of it while in prison for his activities during the French Revolution, to deliver a powerful postrevolutionary message of political and  familial reconciliation.</p>\n",
