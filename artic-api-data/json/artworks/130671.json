She married him despite warnings that he would die within one year and performed deep penance in the hope of securing the gods\u2019 help. In the scene depicted here, on the prophesied day of his death Satyavan has gone to cut wood in the forest, where he falls ill. Savitri can be seen in the background pleading with Yama for her husband\u2019s life.</p>\n",
