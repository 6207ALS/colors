When the death of Caracalla left a scramble for power, Mamaea\u2019s sister Julia Soaemis put her son Elagabalus on the throne. With the help of her mother Julia Maesa, Mamaea overthrew them and made her fourteen-year-old son emperor. He had the good sense to let her and Maesa rule through him. She was recognized as Augusta immediately upon Alexander\u2019s accession, and after the death of Julia Maesa was called the \u201cmother of the emperor and the army camps and the Senate and the country,\u201d as Julia Domna had been before her. She made friends with the Senate in order to balance the influence of the army over imperial policy; she cultivated the arts, completed her cousin Caracalla\u2019s baths in Rome, subsidized teachers and scholars, and invited the theologian Origen to Antioch, where they discussed Christianity. It was the rise of the Sassanid power in Persia and its westward expansion that brought Alexander and Julia Mamaea out to Mesopotamia and a dubious victory, which they celebrated back in Rome in 233. The victorious Venus on the reverse of this coin appeared at the start of the Persian campaigns. Venus Victrix was associated with the ovation, a military triumphal honor. She was also the ancestor of the Julio-Claudians, and indeed the ancestress and protectress of all Romans (as mother of Aeneas, the founder of Rome). Julia\u2019s coinage tended to highlight the traditional deities of Rome, avoiding the novel religious ideas of her assassinated nephew, Elagabalus, and providing reassurance of Rome\u2019s continuity. The inopportune rise of the Alamanni in Germany brought Julia and Alexander back on the campaign trail again; in Mainz, a disgruntled and ambitious Thracian soldier named Maximinus instigated a riot and the imperial mother and son were murdered; the age of the \u201cbarracks emperors\u201d had begun.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">They were empresses in that they ruled or helped to rule Rome.
