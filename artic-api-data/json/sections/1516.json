In drawing, he changed his style and media rapidly depending on the issues that concerned him; this is perhaps best exemplified in Matisse\u2019s earliest known sheets, which display a range of media and marks that can frustrate attempts to synthesize them into a progressive whole. An additional complicating factor is Matisse himself, who reportedly destroyed much of his pre-1900 work and did not regularly date his drawings as he made them. As a result, in looking at these works, we are asked to read Matisse\u2019s mind, searching his marks for evidence of what concerns might have led him to create a particular composition\u2014or, to put it in the artist\u2019s terms, what mental \u201csensations\u201d the individual lines helped him organize and condense as he strove toward resolution.\n\nStanding Female Nude Seen from the Back belongs to a group of works related to Matisse\u2019s studies after a model of around 1900 (see fig. 1.1, fig. 1.2, fig. 1.3, fig. 1.4, and fig. 1.5). In each we see a woman posing within a studio; anecdotal details\u2014posing platforms, chairs, corners of walls\u2014help to identify the location. The artist worked only a few of these drawings to their edges. More typically, he focused his efforts on the figure, and his reduced references to walls or platforms serve to situate her not only in the studio, but also on the expanse of bare sheet. This work, however, goes a step further: at the bottom, the heavy diagonal charcoal strokes seem to dislodge the figure from the flat page. Rather than see the dark hatching around her body as a cast shadow, we might view it as indicating spatial depth; the short, softer, inner strokes on the body itself can be read as building and shaping her form, an approach influenced by Matisse\u2019s concurrent interest in Paul C\u00e9zanne, whose Three Bathers (1879\u201382; fig. 1.6) he acquired in 1899. The final drawn form has the volumetric quality of a bas-relief, even calling to mind Auguste Rodin\u2019s Despair (fig. 1.7), which was made about 1899, the same year Matisse likely shared his drawings with the elder artist.\n\nThis drawing is also distinctive, however, in its subject\u2014a standing figure who raises her arms and turns her back to us. It is noteworthy, given Matisse\u2019s sensitive pairing of media and technique, that we can find almost no similarly posed figures in his paintings. Rather, the pose seems exclusively relegated to drawing and sculpting, prompting us to further consider whether Matisse found these media better suited to his formal investigation of the human back. This theme, which surfaced in drawings such as Standing Female Nude, was one the artist returned to throughout his life, especially in his monumental bas-relief series Backs.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse sketched this figure study in charcoal, employing a stump sparingly, on grayish-cream wove paper. He first placed the figure using slight to moderate pressure with the charcoal stick and then defined the contours using thick, dark lines. He explored different positions for the proper left arm, leaving several versions visible (see fig. 1.8). The artist modeled the figure using loose, parallel hatching. Shading to the left and right of the figure establishes the subject in space. Matisse held the charcoal stick at different angles to vary the width of his lines, rubbing with the flat side for the broad shading to the right of the head and employing the tip for finer lines elsewhere.\n\nThe artist manipulated the charcoal with a stump to create small passages of soft gray tone\u2014for example, in the back of the knees and beneath the raised left arm. He also used the stump in place of an eraser to soften lines he sought to minimize, such as those around the lifted elbow (see fig. 1.8). He rubbed the stump across the negative space to lay in a light-gray tone that is most apparent in vertical marks on the right.\n\nA spray fixative was applied to the drawing. Around the turn of the twentieth century, various apparatuses for spraying a mist of fixative were available, including atomizers and mouth blowers (see fig. 1.9 and fig. 1.10). Under magnification 300\u00d7 fixative is visible as shiny, uneven passages across the sheet. It is not possible to determine whether Matisse or another applied the fixative, but it was done prior to mounting as it is not present on the secondary and tertiary support. The heat and pressure applied during dry mounting appear to have caused the fixative to melt and fuse to the surface.\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 1.11); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The composition is cropped at the top edge where the sheet was trimmed within the image area, likely in preparation for mounting. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, buff color and makes another contrasting 3.3 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 40 \u00d7 29 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue is evident at the edges of the primary and secondary supports under magnification 80\u00d7.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 1.12).\n\nMatisse drew using charcoal with touches of stumping. Under magnification 300\u00d7 the charcoal particles appear relatively fine and of uniform size, suggesting that Matisse used compressed charcoal. In the manufacture of compressed charcoal sticks, natural charcoal was mechanically ground to achieve a finer and more uniform particle size; it was then extruded and molded into sticks. The drawing is fixed.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, grayish-cream wove paper. The paper may have had a slight texture, which would have been compressed during mounting. The sheet was trimmed at the top edge after the drawing was completed, cropping the composition. It cannot be determined whether the other edges were trimmed as well.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, buff wove paper. The top and bottom edges appear hand torn, while the right and left edges are straight cut. The texture on the recto has been compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 1.13), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light (fig. 1.14).\n\nPrimary support: 33 \u00d7 21.4 cm (13 \u00d7 8 3/8 in.); secondary support: 35 \u00d7 23.3 cm (13 13/16 \u00d7 9 3/16 in.); tertiary support: 42 \u00d7 30 cm (16 1/2 \u00d7 11 3/4 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThe drawing and mount are in good condition. There are minor scattered stains and abraded areas on the primary support. The edges of the tertiary support have discolored to brown.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Stieglitz (Jan. 1, 1864\u2013July 13, 1946), New York, probably by late Feb. 1908\u2013July 13, 1946.\n\nBy descent to Alfred Stieglitz Estate, New York, July 13, 1946\u2013Nov. 9, 1949.\n\nBequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 9, 1949.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Possibly New York, Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, An Exhibition of Drawings, Lithographs, Water-Colors, and Etchings by M.

(Arts Council of Great Britain/Museum of Modern Art, New York/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1984), p. 11.\n\nThe drawings related to the present sheet date to the same time as Matisse\u2019s first discoveries of Paul C\u00e9zanne: 1895 was the elder artist\u2019s first solo exhibition at Galerie Ambroise Vollard in Paris, and forty-six years later, Matisse could still recall the \u201cdeformations or malformations\u201d of the figures, which were unusual for that time; the artist\u2019s recollections are recorded in Pierre Courthion, \u201cConversations avec Henri Matisse,\u201d unpublished typescript (1941), p. 66, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, Archives of the History of Art, Santa Monica; and Serge Guilbaut, ed., Chatting with Henri Matisse: The Lost 1941 Interview, trans. Chris Miller (Getty Research Institute, 2013); and quoted in Jack Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, 1869\u20131918 (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 51. Matisse would also acquire works by C\u00e9zanne, most importantly, in 1899, Three Bathers (1879\u201382; fig. 1.6). The story of the purchase has been told many times and originates in Courthion, \u201cConversations avec Henri Matisse,\u201d pp. 46\u201347.\n\nElderfield explains that Matisse took some drawings to Rodin for criticism, probably in 1899; see Elderfield, Drawings of Henri Matisse, p. 26. For more on this visit, see also Raymond Escholier, Matisse, ce vivant (Fayard, 1956), pp. 161\u201362; and Albert E. Elsen, The Sculpture of Henri Matisse (Abrams, 1972), p. 15.\n\nThe sources for Matisse\u2019s Back sculptures\u2014and even the motif\u2014can be traced from Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres to Gustave Courbet to Paul Gauguin, among many others; see Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cBack (I), first state,\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and John Elderfield, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, exh. cat.

However, in a telegram dated February 4, 1908, Edward Steichen stated that he would be bringing back an exhibition of drawings that same month; this is probably when Stieglitz obtained this drawing.
