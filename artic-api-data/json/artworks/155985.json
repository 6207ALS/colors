    "description": "<p>Traditionally the only garment worn by women who had reached puberty, short aprons are important to the history of women's dress in many parts of Africa. Though today such aprons are rarely seen outside of ceremonial contexts, they were considered to be appropriate coverings well into the mid-20th century. Like other forms of dress, women's aprons were made from a variety of materials and in a range of styles that often reflected the social status of the wearer.<br>The widespread importation of glass beads beginning in the late 19th century led to a flowering of beadwork across West and Central Africa and included the production of beaded women's aprons. This apron is from Northern Cameroon and is related to similar aprons from central Cameroon and neighboring Nigeria, Niger, and Chad. The prominent use of beads and cowries suggests that the apron was associated with wealth. The central design consists of a random pattern of multicolored beads of varying sizes. Larger, cylindrical blue beads line the bottom of the apron, attached to cowrie shells by an exposed cotton fringe.</p>\n",
