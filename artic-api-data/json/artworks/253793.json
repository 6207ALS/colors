    "description": "<p>In <em>The Milliners</em>, Theresa Bernstein depicted a group of women sewing accessories on hats, exploring the aesthetic qualities of community and concentration. The window at upper left suggests that they are in a city apartment, perhaps undertaking piecework at home to earn extra income.</p>\n<p>An important voice in early American modernism, Bernstein celebrated the vibrancy and variety of immigrant and working class experiences in 20th-century New York. Born in Krakow, she trained at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, a noted center for female professionalism in the arts. Bernstein pursued a dynamic style of realism throughout her long career, working well past the age of 100.</p>\n",
