He wears the laurel crown, a sign that the Senate had granted him a triumph\u2014the only time during the Republic when a Roman with military imperium (power to command) could legally enter the city at the head of an army. Once acclaimed dictator, Caesar had flaunted his permanent triumphal powers, including the right to wear the laurel crown, which he did (according to the biographer Suetonius) in order to hide his growing baldness. The items sprawled across the reverse of the coin are a remarkable collection of symbols of the late dictator\u2019s claims to near-universal power and the benefits that this universal power was alleged to bring to Rome: the cornucopia, associated with Abundance; the rudder, attribute of Fortune; the globe, a symbol of his conquest of the world (Asia, Africa, and Europe); and the caduceus, representing Felicity. The final item in the lineup is the apex, or flamen\u2019s cap. There were traditionally flamens (priests) of fifteen deities with official cults in Republican Rome, three of which were considered major: those of Mars, Quirinus, and Jupiter. A fourth major flamen was added shortly before Caesar\u2019s assassination: the cult of Divus Julius, with Mark Antony designated as the first flamen. Suetonius lists that honor among those that Caesar, \u201cas a mere mortal,\u201d really ought to have refused. Mark Antony was one of the three triumvirs under whom this coin was minted (for another in this series, see cat. 31, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Mark Antony).\n\nThe moneyer\u2019s name, L. Mussidius Longus, appears on the reverse. He was one of four colleagues who ran the mint in the year 43 B.C., since Caesar had augmented the traditional three.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The tresviri rei publicae constituendae, \u201cthree men for [re]establishing the Republic.\u201d\n\nSuetonius, Julius Caesar, sec. 45.\n\nSuetonius, Julius Caesar, sec. 76.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 30 Denarius (Coin) Portraying Julius Caesar, 42 B.C.\n\n</section>",
