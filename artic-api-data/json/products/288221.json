    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Foldable Tote developed from Edward Hopper\u2019s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Nighthawks</em>, 1942, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">One of the best-known images of twentieth-century art, the painting depicts an all-night diner in which three customers, all lost in their own thoughts, have congregated. Hopper\u2019s understanding of the expressive possibilities of light playing on simplified shapes gives the painting its beauty. Fluorescent lights had just come into use in the early 1940s, and the all-night diner emits an eerie glow, like a beacon on the dark street corner.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16 in. x 26 in.&nbsp; Folded:&nbsp; 4.5 x 5 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> 100% Polyester.</li>\n<li><strong>Hand wash, hang dry.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Folded Tote has small clip to link to a key chain.</strong></li>\n</ul>",
