    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Ornament developed from El Greco's&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Assumption of the Virgin (detail),</em>1577-79, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">With no major commissions in Rome, El Greco moved on to Spain in 1577. He quickly earned a major commission for the altarpiece for the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo, the result being the monumental&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Assumption of the Virgin</em>&nbsp;(1577\u201379). Of a scale and format that he had never previously attempted,&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Assumption</em>&nbsp;became a showpiece for the artist as he attempted to mold a new career for himself in Spain.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5 x 2.6 x .16 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Glass, Ribbon</li></ul>",
