The other two are Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93) and Human Miseries (cat. 95). They can stand on their own, but when placed end to end in the following order\u2014Wayside Shrine in Brittany (left), The Ox Cart (middle), and Human Miseries (right)\u2014they can be read as a friezelike arrangement (see fig. 94.2).\n\nUnlike the plates of the Noa Noa Suite, most of which Gauguin titled within each image, thirteen of the fifteen wood-block plates that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints are unnamed. Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThis wood-block print is one of three that depict pastoral scenes in Brittany and Provence. When considered together, they form a sequence that can be read whether they are arranged as individual objects in a certain order or in a frieze-like arrangement, touching each other end to end (see fig. 94.2). The other two are Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93) and Human Misery (cat. 95). Gauguin left no instructions as to how to display the prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after his death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \u201cHouse of Pleasure\u201d in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThis Breton farm scene features two farmhands at their daily tasks, the exact nature of which is hard to determine. One, standing at the left, seems poised to enter a vertical structure. The body language of the other man suggests he is carrying something. Behind him, in the middle ground, is a two-wheeled cart. The right foreground features an ox. In the background, snow lies on the rooftops of a hamlet situated in an undulating landscape of snow-covered fields.\n\nThe setting derives from three oil paintings Gauguin may have done in Brittany or on his second Polynesian stay: Christmas Night (fig. 94.3 [W 519]), Breton Village in the Snow I (fig. 94.4 [W 524]), and Breton Village in the Snow II (fig. 94.5 [W 525]).\n\nGauguin appropriated the ox from photographs he owned\u2014and took with him on his travels\u2014of Egyptian wall paintings in the British Museum, London (from the so-called Nebamun tomb in Thebes) (fig. 94.6, fig. 94.7). Whether Christmas Night preceded the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints, was done at the same time, or dates from the end of the artist\u2019s life, the pair of oxen in the painting is nearly identical to the two at the center of the wood-block print.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This wood-block print was printed on a thin, translucent paper. The block itself was likely hewn from the same piece of wood that the artist also used for Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93 [Kornfeld 50, B]); both are among the fifteen that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. Gauguin stated that half of the blocks for the suite were used twice, and it is probable that he carved the two matrices from the same plank, not by using the front and back as he had done with blocks in the past, but by sawing thick planks of wood in half laterally to create two thinner sections (see Technical Overview). All of the blocks were carved from indigenous wood; the majority of them are irregularly shaped, a characteristic that Gauguin exploited in some instances and ignored in others. It has been suggested that he used fragments of wood from crates or a piece of furniture to fashion some of these printing blocks. However, close study of the striations and tool marks in the wood, as well as their appearance in impressions where woodblocks are no longer extant (as in this example), reveals that the artist used saw and plane to cut down and level larger and thicker pieces of the soft, more readily available wood that he could find in his immediate surroundings. Study of the print reveals that Gauguin retained the saw-cut vertical striations present along the right side of the block well into the composition (fig. 94.8). Farther to the right he removed them with deep carving and sanding, yet overall the wood-block print is more tonal than linear in nature, especially when compared to its counterpart, Wayside Shrine in Brittany. To retain as much of the piece of wood as possible, he accepted its irregular edges along the top and bottom.\n\nGauguin lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, yet the pronounced textures of wood grain and knots that printed along with his carved imagery are integral to the overall aesthetic appearance of the group. These irregularities set the prints apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images of his Noa Noa Suite. The works in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints are wood-block prints in the true sense of the word: cut crudely into wood that was sawn, planed, and sanded to create work surfaces. These were far too prone to splintering to be incised with the tip of a needle, so the artist relied solely on the knife, drawing on his skill as a sculptor of wood in the round. Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin most likely used a second, thicker paper to support the thin, diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block, and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter one. Using this technique Gauguin could also prevent the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block. Unfortunately, the print was posthumously adhered to a very fibrous thick paper, so any evidence of the use of an underlying printing support is now speculative.\n\nThe wood block was printed in black ink. Gauguin deliberately distributed the ink unevenly on a block that was not flat and, when printed, this resulted in a reticulated impression that emphasizes the irregularities in the wood and enhances the uneven carving of incised lines (fig. 94.9).\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with [glossary:mitsumata (est.) fibers and minimal sizing to print the suite. The diaphanous sheets are translucent, extraordinarily fragile, and easily damaged. In this impression, the tissue-thin sheet was posthumously laid down on an extremely fibrous sheet of Japanese paper. Owing to the thinness of the sheet, the tone and, in this case, the surface quality of any underlying support inevitably distorts its appearance. Here, the texture imparted by the underlying paper fibers in the secondary support has undermined the original smooth, luminous quality of Gauguin\u2019s chosen paper.\n\n195 \u00d7 305 mm (image); 228 \u00d7 307 mm (sheet); 300 \u00d7 310 mm (secondary support)\n\nThe composition is contained within a border on all sides that reflects the irregular contours of the block. In addition to aesthetically creating a bordered vignette, the borders also provided structural stability, allowing the block to withstand the pressure exerted upon it during printing. Much of the block\u2019s surface is retained throughout with all of its irregularities and imperfections. The artist gouged into the block to create high areas that would print as broad tonal passages. This type of tonal work predominates. Linear work was kept to a minimum except for broad incising that appears in the ground on which the figure stands and in his pant legs. Here the artist did not use fine incising needles. Instead, a blade that could more sharply cut into the soft wood was used on its side to incise the block. Minimal manipulation of the wood and the lack of compositional complexity perhaps indicate that this was among the first of the blocks to be cut for the suite, at a moment when Gauguin was experimenting with the aesthetic possibilities made available by the soft wood.\n\nIt also appears that Gauguin took a thick piece of wood, sawed it in half to reduce its thickness, and used the two halves to create the blocks for this and its companion, Wayside Shrine in Brittany (see cat. 93). When the contours of the block as they appear in posthumous impressions of Wayside Shrine in Brittany are overlaid and compared with the contours of the edges of impressions of The Ox Cart, there are striking similarities. First, the saw-cut striations match in both, as does an irregular depression central to the same area. Second, the contour along the top of each matches almost exactly. Gauguin, unsatisfied with simply cutting the wood in half and using the resulting pieces in the same orientation, took the block for Wayside Shrine and rotated it 180 degrees so that the striations appear to the left instead of the right. He trimmed the block along the top to provide a more regular shape and reduced its overall size by approximately 42 mm. For this reason, only now has the pairing of the blocks and the prints pulled from them been recognized (see fig. 94.10).\n\nThe thin Japanese paper was laid down on a very fibrous, medium-weight Japanese paper. In the process the adhesive was brushed on thickly, and both supports were deeply creased in the horizontal and diagonal directions during the mounting process.\n\nThe print is in good condition. It has been mounted with Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93) and Human Miseries (cat. 95) to form a frieze. The impressions were overlapped for visual continuity, and Japanese paper hinges were used to secure each to the mount.  \nHarriet K.

Christmas Night is assigned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art, where it resides, to 1902/3; the museum says that it might have been started in 1894 but that Gauguin finished it in Tahiti.

I was unable to locate a single impression in which all of the edges of the block were clearly printed. Either the sheet of paper shifted when it was lifted from the block, transferring additional ink along the edges, or one or more of the edges had been trimmed. It is equally likely that the papers were slightly smaller than the overall size of the block.\n\nLibuse S\u00fdkorova, Gauguin Woodcuts, trans. Till Gottheiner (P.

Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . .

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper.
