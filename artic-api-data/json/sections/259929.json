In 1903 T. R. Way recalled that \u201cwhenever we put new materials before him, such as a fresh form of transfer paper, instead of relying on his memory for a subject he invariably turned to the window and made a drawing of the houses on the opposite side of the street. Thus it came about that the big bow window at the back of the Gaiety Theatre and the stage door were drawn three or four times over.\u201d In this lithograph Whistler captured the movement of figures at the back of the Gaiety Theatre (fig. 14a). The artist had apparently learned from the failure of his first transfer lithograph (cat. 13), and here radically simplified his drawing style and treatment of the subject matter; the result is a light and airy image entirely different in character from the dark confusion of Old Battersea Bridge, No. 2. This strictly frontal view of the building is one of Whistler\u2019s first explorations of a compositional motif that would appear in his work in every medium during the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nWhen the stone was being prepared for publication in the Notes portfolio in 1887, Whistler added his signature and extended the ground line of the building at the far left. This work was added directly to the stone, as indicated by the reversal of the butterfly and the less grainy quality of these lines. He carefully scratched through the added lines to give them a broken texture and lightness similar to the pronounced grain of the transfer paper. Although it is possible that the drawing was transferred in 1879, no impressions of this subject are known before the addition of the signature and the extended line. Letter 84, letter 85, and letter 86 document at least one printing of Gaiety Stage Door after the edition for Notes in 1887.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (207 \u00d7 305 mm), signed; SC, ivory laid paper (205 \u00d7 308 mm), signed.
