The centerpiece of this 13-story structure was the trading room\u2014a dramatic, double-height space filled with Sullivan\u2019s lush ornament and the multicolored, stenciled wall covering seen here. After an unsuccessful preservation battle in the late 1960s, the building was demolished, but the Art Institute was able to acquire the monumental entry arch, now located in a garden next to the Modern Wing.</p>\n",
