Into the centre of this screws a stylized 4-winged vasiform element, the wings separated by flowerheads, with armorials and hallmarks similar to the above; this element fitted with an additional socket and bobeche, similarly hallmarked and bearing the same armorials. This element fitted with a cast eagle of heavy weight similarly hallmarked but with the date letter \"b\" for 1817. The largest candelabrum of similar design in the base but rising to two eagles spiralling around a lion mask as the shaft and hallmarked for 1817; the single socket fitted with a 3-branched element of spiral design circulating around a centrl font-like device capped by 3 stylized acanthus leaf groups (hallmarked with a king's head and a lion rampant); each arm fitted with a deep, broad bobeche with an eagle on the underside and a spiral arrangement of water leaves (hallmarked with maker's mark, and lion rampant on underside) each sock with a screw-in shaft and ornamented with flowerheads, a lion mask, and a human mask and in turn fitted with a bobeche and socket hallmarked as on the smaller pair and bearing similar armorials; at centre, above the diadem-like acanthus leaf decoration element, a 4-winged vasiform element as in the smaller pair and ornamented with a king's head, a lion rampant and a partially abraded maker's mark.
