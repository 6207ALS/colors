    "description": "<p>Odilon Redon Prince of Dreams 1840-1916 was a traveling exhibition organized by The Art Institute of Chicago in 1994. It displayed 180 works by Redon, in virtually every medium in which he worked. This collection is comprised of printed and archival materials compiled by the curators in preparation of the exhibit and the accompanying catalog. The sources are varied and consist almost entirely of photocopied articles from French newspapers, journals, encyclopedias, catalogs and books from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There are also photocopies/transcriptions of Redon-authored materials from the Andr\u00e9 Mellerio Papers. Materials were annotated, indexed and cross-referenced by the curatorial staff. A small proportion of the papers relate specifically to preparation for the 1994 exhibition and to other Art Institute of Chicago acquisitions of Redon literary and artistic work, both before and after the exhibition.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/findingaids/search/searchterm/Redon,%20Odilon:%20Prince%20of%20Dreams/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
