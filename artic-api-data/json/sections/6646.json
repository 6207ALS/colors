It was that year that he produced Matisse\u2019s Dining Room\u20141941, a masterful sheet that foretells the path that would lead to his 1943 publication of Themes and Variations, one hundred and fifty-eight serial drawings of seventeen different subjects.\n\nMatisse\u2019s Dining Room\u20141941 offers a view of the fluid, constant approach to drawing that the artist put on display in his studio at the H\u00f4tel R\u00e9gina (see fig. 50.1). When writer Francis Carco visited Matisse\u2019s workspace in 1941, he found that the artist had arranged several series of drawings in rows on the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s what I call the cinema of my sensibility,\u201d Matisse said. \u201cWhen my study is done, or rather my point of departure is established, then I let my pen run where it wills.\u201d While many of the drawings of Themes and Variations focus on a single arrangement or figure, in Matisse\u2019s Dining Room\u20141941 the artist used expressive free-flowing lines to show his hand at work, his still life subject on the table, and a suite of drawings of flowers in a vase hanging on the wall. The drawing presents a hand with a pen beginning work on a fresh sheet of paper in front of a decorated domestic interior. On a large table, fruit, bowls, a conch shell, and vases filled with flowers and large fronds draw the eye up to a sequence of still-life drawings of similar subjects on the wall. To the right, the view of a lush landscape through the grid of windowpanes echoes the tiled floor below and the leafy arrangements on the table. The dwarfed armchair in the lower right corner, along the exaggerated molding, stretches the perspective of the work. By including repeated self-referential frames within his drawing, Matisse used the medium to present his artistic process.\n\nIn addition to offering a glimpse of the artist\u2019s drawing practice, Matisse\u2019s Dining Room\u20141941 builds on his own legacy of depicting his domestic studio spaces in works such as Studio under the Eaves (1903; fig. 50.2), The Red Studio (fall 1911; fig. 50.3), and The Pink Studio (1911; fig. 50.4). As with his 1911 paintings that used saturated colors to suggest space, in Matisse\u2019s Dining Room\u20141941, the artist left broad, blank areas on the walls and table. With the surrounding decorative objects including the still life arrangement, tiled floor, recent drawings, and view onto the verdant outdoors, the artist evoked his luminous workspace in a tight pictorial tension.  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse sketched the composition directly with pen and black ink on ivory wove paper. There are no preliminary marks. Using a metal-nibbed dip pen, he drew with ease across the smooth surface of this well-sized Arches drawing paper. Matisse shows his hand holding the pen with his paper supported on a larger board. Pinholes at all corners may indicate that Matisse tacked the paper to the wall, a practice he illustrates in this drawing: on the wall opposite his sketching hand are a series of still lifes of the dining room and tabletop (see fig. 50.5), perhaps all drawings similar to this one.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri Matisse 41 (lower center, in pen and black ink) (fig. 50.6).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. The ink has a high gloss imparted by a resinous binder (possibly shellac). The gloss is accentuated when viewed at an angle.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, smooth, ivory wove paper. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left have an imitation deckle edges indicating that the paper is moldmade. Transmitted-light examination shows an even fiber distribution, also characteristic of a machine-made paper. Raking light shows a very fine screen pattern on the recto imparted by the paper-making screen, yet the surface is still quite smooth. The paper has a watermark in the lower left corner: Arches (see fig. 50.7).\n\n40.5 \u00d7 52.6 cm (16 \u00d7 20 3/4 in.)\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition with minor surface soil at the upper corners. There are minor undulations throughout, evident only in raking light. The support has been thinned at points along the lower edge on the verso (fig. 50.8), likely from adhesive removal.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Pierre Matisse, New York.\n\nWilliam O\u2019Reilly, Salander-O\u2019Reilly Gallery, New York, before Apr. 16, 1985.\n\nSold to Maxwell Davidson III (born Feb. 8, 1939), Maxwell Davidson Gallery, New York, by Apr. 16, 1985\u2013by Dec. 11, 1993.\n\nSold to Dr. Martin Gecht (July 12, 1920\u2013Jan. 4, 2005) and Francey A.
