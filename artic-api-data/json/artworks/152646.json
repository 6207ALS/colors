Believing that Shanna\u2019s chances were impeded by Amber Heath, a rival, she plotted to have Amber\u2019s mother killed. She hoped that the loss would be so overwhelming that Amber would be unable to compete. \n\nWanda Holloway made a payment for the contract killing of Verna Heath in the parking lot of this Grandy\u2019s. The contract was never carried out, and she was convicted of soliciting capital murder and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
