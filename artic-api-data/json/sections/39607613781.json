He sent it to three exhibitions in 1893\u201394, asking a high price for it, and he gave an ambitious account of its genesis modeled after Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cPhilosophy of Composition.\u201d He included a reference to it in Noa Noa, the fictionalized account of his stay on the island, and made a version of it in the Noa Noa Suite (fig. 73.2 [cat. 60.2]; see cat. 60, Commentary). Several other variations, realized from 1893 to 1895, prompted the authors of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his prints to write, \u201cGauguin seems to have been more involved with this theme than any other single subject.\u201d\n\nIn his 1893 Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline) (fig. 73.3), Gauguin explained that his title has two senses: \u201cEither she thinks of the ghost / Or the ghost thinks of her.\u201d Mana\u2018o means \u201cthought, idea, meaning, conception\u201d when used as a noun, and \u201cto think, muse, reflect\u201d when used as a verb; t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u designates \u201ca ghost, or apparition, the supposed spirit of the dead.\u201d In the absence of any further precision, and when one supplies the implicit name of the recumbent woman, the title becomes a syntactical palindrome and can be translated as Gauguin proposed, creating an ontological reversibility between woman and ghost. In Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 73.4 [W 245]), as Gauguin explained to Vincent van Gogh, the landscape with Jacob and the Angel exists \u201conly in the imagination of the praying people\u201d; in Manao tupapau, similarly, the ghost may exist \u201conly in the imagination of the woman,\u201d but, in addition, the woman may as well exist \u201conly in the mind of the ghost.\u201d The artist summarized this symmetrical situation as follows: \u201cThe spirit of a living [woman] connected with the spirit of the dead. Night and day.\u201d In Noa Noa, the description of Manao tupapau is preceded and justified by a story: coming back from Papeete in the heart of night, the narrator finds his mistress, Tehura (Teha\u2018amana), lying awake and terrified on their bed, in darkness as the oil lamp had gone out. In the late nineteenth century, \u201cterror of the dark\u201d was mentioned as a typical characteristic of Polynesians and interpreted as a residue of their ancient worldview.\n\nIn his wood-block print of this image in the Noa Noa Suite, Gauguin departed from the composition of the painting in depicting the recumbent woman curled into a fetal position, showing her back to the spectator and with her left hand clenched into a fist covering her face. This closed posture derives from that of the Peruvian mummy in the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro, Paris (fig. 73.5), which Gauguin had been using as a model to symbolize the negation of life, in contrast to the totally open, risk-taking attitude of the young woman throwing herself into the waves present in a number of his works in various media (see cat. 59, Commentary). The fetal position is therefore connected to death and to the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u. But it also suggests birth or rebirth, and in the print the oval of light into which Gauguin turned the bedding can evoke a giant placenta. This semantic ambivalence is made explicit by a doubling of the figure in Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (fig. 73.6; see cat. 72, Commentary), which Gauguin also painted in France in 1894 and of which he carved a xylographic version (see cat. 80): the curled-up female turning her back to the pool in the foreground answers another woman, with open eyes and slightly extended legs, facing the water and touching it with her feet.\n\nGauguin started working in Paris on the ten wood-block prints of the Noa Noa Suite during the winter of 1893\u201394 and was well advanced by the spring. In March, at the latest, he also realized a lithograph after Manao tupapau (cat. 73.2), which was published by Andr\u00e9 Marty in an edition of one hundred proofs as part of the sixth installment of his portfolio L\u2019estampe originale (see also cat. 73.1), a short-lived but highly influential enterprise promoting the \u201coriginal print\u201d as an art form. This is Gauguin\u2019s only lithograph; he usually resorted to the more affordable zincography technique (see cats. 11\u201323). Its realization may have benefited from the technical assistance of an expert printer, such as P\u00e8re Cotelle from \u00c9douard Ancourt\u2019s atelier, shown working at the lithographic press in Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s cover for the first installment of L\u2019estampe originale (fig. 73.7) while the Parisian cabaret star Jane Avril admires the result. In any event, it appears to have been executed on stone\u2014rather than on transfer paper\u2014with crayon, pen and ink, wash, and scratching (see fig. 73.8), which Gauguin also used on his wood blocks (see cat. 59, Commentary) although it was not a traditional woodcarving technique.\n\nThe Manao tupapau lithograph is a careful and subtle tonal translation of the eponymous painting, which was no easy task since colors played a crucial role in it, expressive as well as formal, as Gauguin had emphasized in a letter to his wife in which he explained that its \u201cgeneral harmony is somber, sad and frightening, sounding on the eye like a funeral knell.\u201d Possibly to compensate for some inevitable deficit in this regard, and certainly because working on the text of Noa Noa and the plates of the Noa Noa Suite had led him to compare and combine elements of the works he had brought back from Tahiti, he enriched the \u201cnocturnal\u201d and supernatural domain of the painting, which originally included not only the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u but also the post decorated with the face of the creator god Ta\u2018aroa, against which the ghost leans, and mysterious flowers, phosphorescences, or \u201csparks\u201d (see fig. 73.9 and cat. 60, Commentary). To the left of the post, Gauguin added into the lithograph a profile head of the earth god Tefatu hovering above the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u, with blank eye and open mouth, and on the right the moon goddess Hina, facing front and depicted from the thighs up.\n\nThe simultaneous presence of Tefatu and Hina refers to their dispute around the issue of the mortality of man, which the former imposes against the latter\u2019s desire, so that they logically stand, opposed, on each side of the post, with Tefatu joining the \u201cspirit of the dead.\u201d But whereas Hina appears to be pleading in Te atua (The God) (see cat. 53, Commentary) and other works (see cats. 61\u201363, Commentary), her frontal stance at the extremity of the lithograph suggests that, in some way, her will prevails. In comparison with the painting, the eyes of Ta\u2018aroa now feature pupils that indicate an upward gaze. Placed between the warring deities, the creator god may appear as a mediator, but he is formally closer to Hina, with the oblique motif crossing his face a prolongation of her right arm. Finally, the goddess\u2019s power is augmented by a doubling of her face: her eyes are blank, but her torso clearly suggests a face. Gauguin had spoken of \u201cthe breasts\u2019 eyes\u201d in relation to the specific \u201csculptural form\u201d of the Tahitians, in the first manuscript of Noa Noa, in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles (fig. 73.10), and he dotted the i\u2019s here by giving them irises.\n\nIn the upper left corner, the ambiguous motif placed above Teha\u2018amana\u2019s head in the painting and the undulating band carrying a Marquesan-type face of the Noa Noa Suite wood-block print (see cat. 60, Commentary, fig. 60.48) give way to the frame of a majestic headboard (fig. 73.11), a precursor of the more clearly identified one of the later painting Nevermore (fig. 73.12 [W 558]). This headboard is decorated with Gauguin\u2019s monogram PGO and a symmetrical ornament, which Stephen Eisenman described as a \u201cstrange, abstracted butterfly figure.\u201d With its two almond-shaped wings or handles at the upper extremities, it suggests again a pair of eyes and adds an uncanny companion to the gaze the recumbent woman directs to the spectator. It derives from Gauguin\u2019s study of Marquesan ornament, also put to profit in the decorative band of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (see cat. 56, Commentary) and in many other works, and its cryptographic quality is in line with the artist\u2019s pan-semiotic reflections and his fascination with the Easter Island glyphs (see cat. 50). Its general structure is similar to that of the large motif behind the severed head in Arii matamoe (The Royal End) (fig. 73.13 [W 453]), which is based upon a specific Marquesan taiana (ear ornament) (see cat. 41); as in the central motif of the headboard in Nevermore, repeated under the raven in the same painting, the motif\u2019s central section comprises a vertical element entering a concave circle or oval, producing a figure/ground reversibility reminiscent of the Marquesan ipu (\u201ccontainer\u201d) (see cat. 53, Commentary).\n\nWhereas the upper part of the lithographic version of Manao tupapau adds considerably to the corresponding portions of the painting and the wood-block print, the lower part subtracts (fig. 73.14), suppressing\u2014maybe as another sort of compensation\u2014the malicious flower/face placed between two mangoes among the decorative motifs of the pareu spread on the bed. Curiously, on the other hand, Gauguin retained from the painting the apparently insignificant detail of two folds of the bedsheet draping over the lower part of the mattress, of which he had found the model just under the slippered foot of the courtesan in \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Olympia (fig. 73.15), and which he had carefully included in his 1891 copy of the painting (fig. 73.16 [W 413]. In the poem after Manao tupapau that he wrote in the summer of 1894, Alfred Jarry called its female protagonist \u201cOlympia,\u201d and for the Parisian public, which must have been sensitive to the link between the two works, Gauguin offered a delightful anecdote in Noa Noa: having found a photograph of Manet\u2019s painting in the artist\u2019s house, a Tahitian neighbor asked, \u201cIs it your wife?,\u201d to which the narrator replied, \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 I lied. Me, the t\u0101ne of Olympia!\u201d\n\nFinally, one can observe that, in comparison with those in the painting, the sheets have lost their materiality and the pillow has swelled up, giving the impression that Teha\u2018amana is levitating, as if carried away on a cloud or a flying carpet toward te p\u014d, the realm of the dead, the ancestors, and the gods (see cat. 52, Commentary). This visionary quality recalls another interpretation of Manet\u2019s Olympia, Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s 1873/74 Modern Olympia (fig. 73.17), in which he turned the realistic image into an erotic phantasmagoria. Stephen Eisenman, who rightly noted that Gauguin\u2019s lithograph lifts the scene of Manao tupapau \u201cfrom earth to heaven, from the carnal to the sacred,\u201d concluded that \u201cmuch of the anecdotal and even sexual character of the painting is excluded from the print.\u201d The sacred, however, may be compatible with the sexual in this case, as Gauguin\u2019s use of the lithograph in his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, held at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, suggests. On folio 37R, at the beginning of the fourth chapter, in which the narrator describes his integration into the life of a Tahitian village and evokes the evening gatherings of its inhabitants, he painted a summary but effective version of the love-making couple from Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (see cat. 58, Commentary) and pasted underneath it an image of the nude body of Teha\u2018amana, cut from the lithograph with a portion of the pillow and bedsheets (fig. 73.18).\n\nIn the spring of 1894, Gauguin left Paris for Brittany, and at some point during his stay started working on his largest wood-block print, a new and radically transformed version of Manao tupapau (cat. 77.3). At first sight, it looks as if the nude at the bottom repeats the one in the mummy/fetus position in the Noa Noa Suite (fig. 73.2), but, on closer examination, it becomes evident that there are significant differences between the two. This woman does not cover her face with a clenched fist, but keeps her arm between her thighs and has a flower in her hair or behind her ear. In relation to Mahana no atua (fig. 73.6), she appears to combine traits from the two figures lying on the sand, the bent legs of the one on the right and the uncovered face of the one on the left whose position would be further uncurled in Nevermore (fig. 73.12). The upper part of her body is no longer contained within a white oval, and the darkness surrounding her is limited to a broad arc, broken by her protruding foot. Beyond this border, echoed by a small hill and a bush, extends an open landscape topped by two large communal houses sitting at the horizon, each accompanied by an enormous tree or group of trees. The bush, studded with flowers, is a transformed version of the pink pillow with flower motifs in the Manao tupapau painting, which was retained in the lithograph but not in the plate in the Noa Noa Suite. On the left, at the foot of a tree with leaves that are symmetrical in shape, sits a dog whose head points toward a large jar. On the right, beyond what may be a river or a pond, three women perform a ritual dance around a giant statue of the seated Hina, which faces toward the communal houses. Gauguin colored the print with the help of stencils, and he retained an impression (cat. 77.2) in which the block, having probably slipped during printing, redoubled the outlines and produced an extreme version of the animation effect he was often exploring (see cat. 56, Commentary).\n\nIn this new xylographic version of Manao tupapau, Teha\u2018amana does not appear haunted by a nocturnal world of ghosts, ancestors, and gods, but rather is facing\u2014or dreaming of\u2014a brightly colored, diurnal world of natural abundance and religious celebration. The scene of dancing around the Hina statue (fig. 73.19) derives from paintings like Mata mua (In Olden Times) (fig. 73.20 [W 467]), which Gauguin interpreted in the Noa Noa Suite by means of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (fig. 73.21; see cat. 55, Commentary). In the first draft of Noa Noa, it is a scene that the narrator witnesses after leaving the coastal path and reaching a small valley, where \u201cseveral people live and want to go on living in the old way.\u201d But in the later versions of the text, Gauguin made clear that this spatial and temporal enclave was in fact a vision. Mata mua was included in Gauguin\u2019s November 1893 exhibition in Paris of his Tahitian works and its title translated as Autrefois (\u201cOnce\u201d or \u201cIn Olden Times\u201d) in the catalogue. Should we similarly consider that the world surrounding Teha\u2018amana in this wood-block print represents a vision\u2014her vision perhaps\u2014of the Tahitian past as imagined by Gauguin?\n\nA specific feature of this image is the doubling of the communal house with tree, which suggests human abundance and may refer antiphrastically to the dramatic depopulation experienced by Tahiti as a result of contact with European navigators and their illnesses, not least of all venereal diseases. This duplication, further augmented in the off-register double impression (cat. 77.2), also parallels an intensification device of the Tahitian language that Gauguin obviously enjoyed, since he put it to use in several of his titles, such as Noa Noa and Nave nave fenua (see cat. 51, Commentary, and cat. 56, Commentary). And it also recalls an excerpt from Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s Marginalia that Gauguin copied in Cahier pour Aline: \u201cWe can, at any time, double the true beauty of an actual landscape by half closing our eyes as we look at it. The naked Senses sometimes see too little\u2014but then always they see too much.\u201d\n\nThe dark area in which Teha\u2018amana lies is not a hemisphere but could be seen as the upper portion of a very large oval. Richard Brettell described it as \u201can imaginary pond in the midst of a Tahitian village,\u201d but, except by analogy with Mahana no atua (fig. 73.6), where the nudes sit or lie close to an expanse of water, nothing in this black shape infers such an identification. Rather, it suggests an enclosure within the earth, like a sepulchral chamber in a tumulus, or a cavity in which a seed is buried to germinate. The two metaphors, which correspond to the ambivalence of the woman\u2019s mummy/fetus position, are not mutually exclusive. The curved hill, a repetition of the dark shape with a larger radius, supports the notion of a womb, like the spectacular yellow hill in Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (fig. 73.22 [W 484]).\n\nThe sitting dog could fit in the funerary aspect of these associations, as would the jar (or urn), but in relation to Teha\u2018amana it recalls an earlier painting, The Loss of Virginity (fig. 73.23 [W 412]), in which a fox\u2014with almond-shaped eyes like the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u of the painting Manao tupapau (fig. 73.1)\u2014lays a paw on the recumbent nude\u2019s breast. Gauguin replaced the fox and the wolf as personal symbols with the dog in Polynesia (see cat. 51, Commentary), and we may safely assume that it plays this role here. However, instead of exhibiting a domineering or proprietary attitude, the animal keeps a respectful distance from the woman and appears to guard her. On the other side of the print, a small animal crawls toward the bottom of the nude (fig. 73.19 [Kornfeld 29 III]). A comparison with the central motif at the back of Gauguin\u2019s ceramic Bust-Vase with Exploded Head/Vase (Atahualpa) (fig. 73.24) reveals that it is a caterpillar metamorphosing into a butterfly, a traditional symbol of death leading to rebirth.\n\nAll these elements suggest that in its transformation from the 1892 painting to the 1894/95 wood-block print (cat. 77.2 and cat. 77.3) by way of the lithograph (cat. 73.1) and the Noa Noa Suite plate (fig. 73.2), the theme of Manao tupapau shifted from the evocation of a threatening, residual presence of past beliefs to that of a possible rebirth of the life and culture to which they belonged. In this process, the figure of Teha\u2018amana and its postural transformations play a pivotal role\u2014literally\u2014with its mummy/fetus ambivalence changing emphasis from the former to the latter pole: the protruding foot, connecting the woman to the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u in the Noa Noa Suite, becomes the radicle of a germinating seed in the later xylograph. Gauguin\u2019s integration of two fragments from a first-state impression of this work into his manuscript of Noa Noa held at the Louvre support such an interpretation. On folio 33R, he pasted the upper right corner of the large woodcut (with the Hina statue and dancers) above the right section of Te po (see cat. 52), indicating a continuity\u2014and possibly an ascension\u2014between the nocturnal world of the spirits and the diurnal world of celebration (fig. 73.25). And on folio 41R, he pasted the body of Teha\u2018amana under a new, painted version of the Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) watercolor showing a couple copulating on the corolla of an anthrozoomorphic plant (fig. 73.26), so that the stem of the plant appears to grow out of her, as in a tree of Jesse (see fig. 73.27), and her face seems to mirror that of the woman being impregnated. A third fragment from the same impression, corresponding to the left extremity of the wood-block print, has been preserved independently and is in the collection of the Art Institute (cat. 77.1).\n\nThe preceding interpretation is also consistent with the narrative connecting several major works from Gauguin\u2019s first Tahitian stay that Charles Morice expressed in poetical additions to Noa Noa such as \u201cPapemo\u00eb\u201d and \u201cParahi T\u00e9 Mara\u00eb.\u201d These texts allow one to suggest that he did not devise this reading entirely on his own, but rather developed it out of the numerous conversations he had with the artist. In \u201cParahi T\u00e9 Mara\u00eb,\u201d the gods are dead and the women are sterile because the Tahitians have put an end to ritual human sacrifices, but Tehura (Teha\u2018amana) has been chosen and is approached by the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018us to become Ta\u2018aroa\u2019s new consort and to give birth to a new race. In \u201cPapemo\u00eb\u201d a source springing from the foot of the \u201cbaleful tree\u201d felled by the man with the ax (see cat. 47 and cats. 61\u201363) promises those who drink from it, and who are willing to sacrifice life again (such practices had been discontinued as a result of the missionaries\u2019 influence), a \u201crefuge in the luminous garden of the New Olden Times.\u201d In an 1897 prepublication of \u201cParahi T\u00e9 Mara\u00eb\u201d illustrated by Gauguin\u2019s friend and disciple Armand S\u00e9guin, the willing Tehura extends her body like an odalisque in front of an abstracted face or mask of Ta\u2018aroa (fig. 73.28), which may be compared to the headboard in Nevermore (fig. 73.12).\n\nFinally, at some point after\u2014or before\u2014he created the large Manao tupapau (cat. 77.2 and cat. 77.3), Gauguin carved on the other side of the wood block three small subjects (see cat. 60, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 8 and fig. 9), posthumously entitled Maori Woman in the Forest and Standing Maori Woman. Only one impression with the three subjects is known (fig. 73.29), and there is only one printed by Gauguin that includes Manao tupapau and Maori Woman in the Forest, whereas he printed a few of each separately, so that they should probably be considered independently one from the other. The small Manao tupapau (cat. 78.1), of which the Art Institute also possesses a posthumous impression by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid (cat. 78.2), is a reduced version of the subject, joining in a vertical format the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u in profile, a rather indistinct decorated post and headboard, and the head, hands, and shoulders of Teha\u2018amana, whose features are more \u201csavage\u201d than in the painting or the lithograph. Whatever its exact position in the relative chronology of Gauguin\u2019s interpretations of his theme, it goes back to his own synthetizing definition of it: \u201cThe spirit of a living [woman] connected with the spirit of the dead. Night and day.\u201d This almost diagrammatic quality is responsible for its interest and relates it to images of confrontation, such as \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s rendering of the narrator\u2019s submission to Poe\u2019s Raven (fig. 73.30) or Gauguin\u2019s Bust of a Young Girl with a Fox (fig. 73.31), a charcoal study for The Loss of Virginity.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Gauguin spelled the title Mana\u00f2 tupapa\u00fa on the painting.\n\nSee Charles F.

Stevenson reported that \u201cno Tahitian would have lain down without one [lamp] lighted\u201d (p. 198) and quoted the remark of a Dr. Codrington about the Marquesans: \u201cWhen a native says that he is a man, he means that he is a man and not a ghost; not that he is a man and not a beast.

If, for some reason, this publication was delayed and Gauguin started working on the lithograph much earlier, he could have done so before creating the Noa Noa Suite version of Manao tupapau (fig. 2 [cat. 60]), which would be logical to the extent that the lithograph is closer to the original composition (as far as the main figure is concerned). Such a relative chronology might even help explain Gauguin\u2019s unorthodox application to wood-engraving tools generally used for lithography (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d).\n\nMarcel Gu\u00e9rin wrote that Gauguin\u2019s Volpini Suite had been printed at Ancourt\u2019s atelier, but this was based on late recollections of Paul S\u00e9rusier and is not certain; Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.

Stephen Eisenman envisioned three possible accounts of the genesis of these images; he favored one, according to which Gauguin would have made them after the lithographic version of Manao tupapau but before the large xylographic one, leaving the side of the wood block first used as \u201can unfinished work of art\u201d; Eisenman, ed., Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream, exh. cat. (Skira, 2007), p. 314, cat. 89. Gauguin further developed this practice of repurposing wood blocks in the following years and seems to have taken pride in doing so (See Introduction to the Suite of Late Wood-block Prints).\n\nFor Richard Brettell, the fact that Gauguin juxtaposed the small Manao tupapau and Maori Woman in the Forest and chose not to cut them apart indicates that they were somewhat linked in the artist\u2019s mind, and he suggested that, since Maori Woman in the Forest represents a squatting woman in the act of urinating\u2014as one knows from its model, the 1892 painting Te poipoi (The Morning) (private collection, Hong Kong [W 485])\u2014the artist\u2019s \u201cintention in juxtaposing this figure with the face and upper torso of a frightened nude may have been to convey a sense of taboo or shame at being caught unaware\u201d; Richard R.
