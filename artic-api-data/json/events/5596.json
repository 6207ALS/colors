    "description": "<p>Hear from Maren Hassinger (American, born 1947), whose expansive practice articulates the relationship between nature and humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Carefully choosing materials for their innate characteristics, Hassinger has explored the subjects of movement, family, love, nature, environment, consumerism, identity, and race. Wire rope has held a prominent role in Hassinger\u2019s artistic practice since the early 1970s, when, as a sculptor placed in the Fiber Arts program at UCLA, Hassinger used the material to bridge the gap between the two disciplines. Binding nature with industry, the artist takes a biomimetic approach to the material. She often unravels the ends of her material to resemble frayed natural fibers, blurring the lines between man-made and natural materials. Labor-intensive, yet appearing soft and fragile, Hassinger\u2019s sculptures embrace and connect the dichotomies within, offering a contemplative space to celebrate the beauty and solace to be found in nature while calling to account the gradual erasure of the natural world. Recent work extends her practice further into the natural world, creating vessel-like sculptures as metaphor for the human body, a reminder of our universal kinship and commonality.</p><h2>SPONSOR</h2><p>This program is made possible with the support of Paul Rehder Salon. </p>",
