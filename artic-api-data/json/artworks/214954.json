    "description": "<p>Named by the architect after the shape of the plan, the Hot Dog House was developed for a client as a Michigan summer house. The two sides of the narrow home react to the environment\u2014the side facing the highway has a blank facade while the opposite, private side opens up to the natural landscape. In a similar formal approach, the two-car garage for the Regional Library for the Blind derives its form from its function\u2014in this case, a car. Painting the image of a car on the facade for an audience that presumably cannot see is a typically ironic gesture by Tigerman. While this act could be read as tongue-in-cheek, for Tigerman humor is used seriously as a symbolic statement to draw attention to the core issues of a project.</p>\n",
