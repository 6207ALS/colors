    "description": "Alphonse Mucha\u2019s iconic linework remains some of the most recognizable art from the 19th century. Producing lithographs advertising everything from champagne to theatre productions, his portraiture of glamorous women draped in flowing gowns and pastel florals helped to define the Art Nouveau movement. Mucha wrote of his work, \u201cI was happy to be involved in an art for the people and not for private drawing rooms. It was inexpensive, accessible to the general public, and it found a home in poor families as well as in more affluent circles.\u201d Fourteen of Mucha\u2019s decorative prints are reproduced in this calendar.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Closed 12 x 13 x .125 in, Open 12 x 26 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> High-quality printing with soy-based inks on premium, environmentally sourced paper stock, and easy to write on grid pages</li>\n</ul>",
