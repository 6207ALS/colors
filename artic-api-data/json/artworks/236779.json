    "description": "<p>Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person\u2014Julius Caesar\u2014appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.</p>\n<p>Inscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign\u2019s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler\u2019s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today.</p>\n<p>On the front of this well-preserved coin is a portrait of the Roman emperor Maximianus Herculius (reigned 286\u2013305). He was one of the four men (called tetrarchs) who together ruled the Roman Empire at this time, after its division into east and west halves under Diocletian. Maximianus is identified by the inscription that encircles his portrait\u2014MAXIMIA - NVS P F AVG. The phrase P[ius] F[elix] Augustus indicates that he is a \u201cdutiful\u201d and \u201chappy\u201d emperor. Diocletian gave Maximianus the title of Herculius, a reference to the great hero Hercules, who is depicted on the back of the coin with his characteristic club and lion skin.</p>\n",
