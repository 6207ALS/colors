    "description": "<p>Histories of modern and contemporary art often celebrate abstraction for its utopian presumptions. In many parts of East and Southeast Asia, these presumptions coincided with unbridled aspirations for a cosmopolitan life, particularly in the contested years of decolonization, postwar reconstruction, and authoritarian regime building that marked the years from roughly 1950 to 1980.</p><p>For artists like Kim Lim, Li Yuan Chia, Ha Chonghyun, Mario Yrissary, Susan de la Rosa Aragon, and Jung Tak-young, abstraction was viewed as a means of working around geopolitical and social divisions at a time when national, racial, and ideological divisions were particularly stark. Abstraction became a way of envisioning a world based on the free give-and-take of intellectual and psychological resources.</p><p>Joan Kee, University of Michigan, is a specialist in the modern and contemporary art of East and Southeast Asia. Her recent publications include <em>Contemporary Korean Art: Tansaekhwa and the Urgency of Method</em> (2013). A former attorney, she has also published extensively on issues of art law. </p><p>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents during this event and every Thursday 5:00\u20138:00. </p>",
