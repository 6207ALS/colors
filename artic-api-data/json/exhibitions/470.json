    "short_description": "Like people around the world, the Japanese of the Edo period (1615\u20131868) found foreigners fascinating, and woodblock print (ukiyo-e) artists and publishers were only too happy to accommodate the public\u2019s appetite. Foreign Faces in Japanese Prints presents a range of works by some of the most prominent ukiyo-e artists of the 17th through 19th century, including Hishikawa Moronobu, Okumura Masanobu, Suzuki Harunobu, Kitagawa Utamaro, and Katsushika Hokusai. Printed books and lacquerware with foreign imagery are also\u00a0on display.",
