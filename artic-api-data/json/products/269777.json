    "description": "This catalogue presents 59 masterful Italian drawings from the late 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries: working drawings, preparatory sketches, and finished compositions that have been added in recent years to the private collection of Jean and Steven Goldman. In her essays, Jean Goldman assesses the collection within the context of Mannerism and the role of drawing in the business of art. She and Nicolas Schwed co-authored detailed entries on the works\u2019 attributions, subjects, and functions, complete with documentation including provenance, bibliography, exhibition history, and comparative illustrations. The catalogue presents the work of more than forty artists, some of whom, such as Giorgio Vasari and Pietro da Cortona, were major figures, and others who were virtually unknown. Together, these magnificent works trace the rise and evolution of Mannerism in Italy.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Contributions by Jean Goldman and Nicolas Schwed<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Edited by Suzanne Folds McCullagh<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.5 x 12 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 200</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 78 color + 91 b-w illus.</li>\n</ul>",
