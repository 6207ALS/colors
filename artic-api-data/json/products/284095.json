It was the last conversation about their work that Jeanne-Claude had before her passing in 2009. The result is an eloquent homage to Jeanne-Claude and\u00a0a celebration of the work of two artists whose imagination has affected the landscape of every continent.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hardcover</p><p>Pages:\u00a0 616</p><p>Product Dimensions:\u00a0 11.5 in. x 15.4 in.\u00a0</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Additional Shipping $15 per Order.</em></p><p><em>This item cannot be shipped to a destination outside the United States.</em></p>",
