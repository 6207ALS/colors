Wall revetment fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished on the face. The fragment preserves part of an inlay, but none of the edges appears to be original. In a colorless matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from densely packed segments of two canes: one square cane of yellow rods cased in deep green, a second of aquamarine rods floating in a random fashion.\n\nThe fragment is broken on all sides; the face was repolished, the sides dull with some brown incrustation and some slight patches of iridescent film.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 94 Fragment of a Wall Revetment, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
