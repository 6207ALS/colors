    "title": "Gloria Groom Talks about the Manet You Don't Know",
    "copy": " The communications staff managed to find a few moments with curator Gloria Groom to ask her a few pressing questions about her latest exhibition, Manet and Modern Beauty .   How did this exhibition come about? In 2014, the Getty acquired a Manet painting\u2014 Jeanne (Spring) \u2014that had been rarely seen since 1884. Not only is it just beautiful, but it so quintessentially embodies his late style.   It captures his ambitions as a Salon painter at the end of his life, but it\u2019s also about feminine beauty and fashion. You can also see this new idea of decoration that he was becoming increasingly interested in\u2014the idea of painting flat and painting for a wall. So it had everything, and that\u2019s what sparked the idea. Why is the exhibition called Manet and Modern Beauty ? What\u2019s modern about it? During the last three years of his life, Manet positioned himself, literally, as the painter of modern life by exhibiting by himself in a special venue called La Vie Moderne (Modern Life). So that\u2019s the modern part. Beauty was inspired partly by Baudelaire\u2019s two-part concept of beauty: the eternal and the fleeting. Manet represented both sides\u2014being fully of his time and yet capturing these ephemeral moments of fashion forever in paint.   The exhibition focuses on Manet\u2019s late work, which until recently hasn\u2019t been studied by art historians in the same way as his earlier masterpieces. Why not? His late work is complicated. There are two parallel lines that run throughout his career: there's the Salon submissions in which he wanted to show himself in the tradition of great painting, and then there's his work that is more intimate, more spontaneous, where he\u2019s looking toward the Impressionists and imbibing their ideas about depicting modern life but doing it in his own way.   What happens at the end of his life is that these two parallels intersect: while he\u2019s doing the seemingly spontaneous kinds of things, he\u2019s also doing the Salon paintings, though because of his illness, he\u2019s setting them up in his studio. He\u2019s fashioning scenes and people almost like still lifes, and they look very convincingly as if they\u2019re in the caf\u00e9 or the garden.   He has this wonderful description of his studio: the marble caf\u00e9 table, the fabrics on the chairs, the sofa\u2014he\u2019s got all of these props to recreate the outside world. And he actually does go out and buy the dress that Jeanne Demarsy is wearing in her portrait; he\u2019s fashioning the model rather than the opposite. So it really shows you that while his world is shrinking, he\u2019s thinking, \u201cOkay, this is what I\u2019ve got to do. I\u2019m not going to let my physical setbacks stop me from making art.\u201d   The pastels and illustrated letters feel very intimate. Do you think they show a different side of the artist? They show how his world had shrunk. Instead of being the flaneur, or the man-about-town, as you see in our beautiful portrait of him by Henri Fantin-Latour, he is now a man about the studio. People are coming to him rather than him going to them.   What do you hope visitors take away from this exhibition? With every artist, there is the artist we know and the artist we don\u2019t know, and our job at the Art Institute, where we have such wonderful examples of all of the Impressionists, is to take you into the realm of something that you didn\u2019t know.   There are a number of his more familiar Salon paintings in the exhibition that will make you gasp, but then there\u2019s this whole other portion of it that really speaks to a more intimate, unknowable, unknown artist, one who always manages, despite his challenges, to take your breath away.
