    "description": "You Are Beautiful began in 2002 as a sticker that spreads a hopeful message through public art. Their goal? To be a positive force and transmit a simple idea: Everyone deserves to feel good with who they are. Soon they were shipping little stickers around the globe, in over one hundred languages. Since then, the project has actively combatted negativity by distributing millions of stickers and grown into large-scale, metal and wood installations, murals, as well as collaborations with many designers, students, and artists, worldwide. The community-based message always includes your voice, &amp; they invite you to keep sharing hope with your world.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Take a moment to reflect with in the stunning laser etched acrylic mirrors.
