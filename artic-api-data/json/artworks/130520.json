This rare, early canvas shows Zorach\u2019s love of organic forms of nature and his exuberant use of color\u2014a direction he was encouraged to explore by his wife, the artist Marguerite Thompson Zorach. The four languid nudes in a pastoral setting create a splendid vision of the <em>vie artistique</em>, while the often nonnaturalistic hues draw attention to the abstracted, patterned surface. <em>Summer</em> also reveals the artist\u2019s admiration for the work of Henri Matisse, which he would have seen in Paris and at the 1913 Armory Show.</p>\n",
