My sister, Shirley, started here as an accounting clerk. She called me one day\u201429 years ago\u2014to tell me that there was a position in the Mail Room. It was amazing because they had never had a woman in the Mail Room. I became the first one.   How has your role at the museum changed over the years? When I started, we had to write down every transaction. There was a machine that stamped letters, but it didn\u2019t account for the sale. So I started looking into it and finally asked to get an accounting machine. Then things started to grow, and we changed the name to the Mail Center. I went from clerk to supervisor and then to manager. In 2010, they asked me to become a security operations manager as well and, about a year after that, to oversee Receiving, so that\u2019s how I became manager for Operations, Receiving, and the Mail Center.   What\u2019s your typical day like? I don\u2019t have a typical day because it can change in a split second. But I always attend the morning manager\u2019s briefing, where we discuss issues to be aware of each day. Often we\u2019ll meet out in the galleries, and curators will come talk to us about a new installation so that the officers can be ready to answer visitors\u2019 questions. I walk through the galleries to make sure things are okay, and then I greet our first visitors at Michigan Avenue or the Modern Wing doors. After that, I go to the Mail Center and then back out into the galleries. Because I do so much walking, I wear comfortable shoes.   What is your favorite part of a day on the job? In the morning, when I greet the patrons\u2014that is my favorite thing because people smile and you get to talk with them. Some visitors are so happy to be here because they just love the art.   What do you think would surprise most visitors to know about the museum behind the scenes? How much work goes into each exhibition. Just to see how many different people and departments it takes\u2014carpenters, electricians, painters, registrars, art handlers, conservators, curators, designers, security\u2014and I know I\u2019m forgetting people too. Someone has to take care of every little detail, and what\u2019s great is that everyone cares so much about what they do. It\u2019s amazing to watch.   Everyone here at the museum seems to know you. Why do you think that is? First, I hope it\u2019s because I\u2019m a valuable source of information. If I don\u2019t have the answer to a question, there\u2019s a 99.9% chance that I can get you the answer or point you in the right direction. I also treat everybody the way I want to be treated. We\u2019re like a family, especially those of us who have been here for a long time. Also, I was a Girl Scout troop leader for many, many years and sold thousands of boxes of cookies around here!   What\u2019s one of your favorite things about Chicago? Deep-dish pizza. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that. And I love my museum. My kids came here all the time. My youngest daughter started here in day camp and eventually went to DePaul with the museum\u2019s Tuition Exchange Program. And she just graduated cum laude. And now my kids all like to bring their friends. \u201cYour mom works for the Art Institute?\u201d they ask. It\u2019s a huge deal. ",
