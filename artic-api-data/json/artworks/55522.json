For Man Ray, the surface of the photographic paper became a sketch pad where unrelated objects, drawn by light, merged to create abstract compositions evocative of dreams and imaginary scenes. The artist exhibited his experimental photograms alongside paintings and sculptural objects within months of his move to Paris from New York. Through such exhibitions, he advanced an artistic identity that included photography among a variety of media experiments.</p>\n",
