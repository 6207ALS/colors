    "description": "<p>White cotton dresses first appeared in French fashion in the 1780s; the simplicity of the delicate column-like silhouette was seen as an ideal expression of Neoclassical femininity, a look inspired by Classical Greek and Roman statuary. The quality of this cotton was nearly impossible to replicate using European industrial methods, adding to its cachet.</p>\n<p>The prevailing fashion for light, sheer cotton gowns necessitated a range of accessories to keep women warm. The short Spencer jacket complemented high-waisted gowns such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/250437\">this example in the museum's collection (AIC 2019.787.1)</a>. The woman\u2019s version was adapted from menswear and was probably inspired by the English second Earl of Spencer (1758\u20131834), who reportedly cut off the tails of a damaged coat and invented a new style. Short jackets were made of a variety of fabrics; this example\u2019s block-printed cotton is a product of the French printing industry that was inspired by the global trade in colorful, Indian cotton fabrics.</p>\n",
