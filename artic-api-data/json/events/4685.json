    "description": "<p>Among the glories of Classical Greece were the hoplites, citizen-soldiers who guaranteed the defense of their cities. Named for the words for their shields and other bronze gear, these soldiers ultimately gave us a tradition of government by citizen assemblies, since only those who served their communities in warfare could be awarded full voting rights or hold public office. In this illustrated lecture, John Hale, professor and director of the Liberal Studies Program at the University of Louisville,&nbsp;presents&nbsp;the epic story of the Greek hoplite tradition and recounts&nbsp;his&nbsp;archaeological&nbsp;quest to recover hoplite weapons and other objects from Greek battles on land and sea.</p><p>For more information, call (312) 443-3697 or email <a href=\"mailto:CAS@artic.edu\">CAS@artic.edu</a>.</p><p>Presented by the Classical Art Society </p>",
