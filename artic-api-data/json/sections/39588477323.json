On the recto is a pastel depiction of a crouching Tahitian woman. On the verso is a seated half-length Tahitian female, rendered in charcoal, wearing a missionary-style dress, and holding what is perhaps an animal on her lap. Since the head of the latter figure is cropped, while the crouching woman is completely represented, the charcoal study was undoubtedly drawn first and cut down before the pastel was created on what is now considered the sheet\u2019s recto. The woman on the verso has been identified as a preliminary idea for the 1891 painting Faaturuma (Melancholic) (fig. 46.2 [W 424), although the direction of the sitter in the painting is reversed. She sits on a chair (which is not present in the drawing) and holds a handkerchief instead of an animal. The orientation of the head of the figure in the drawing, the shrug of her shoulders, and her distinctive, round face also relate to a woman depicted in another painting, Te faaturuma (The Brooding Woman), also from 1891 (fig. 46.3 [W 440). A large pastel study for this painting (fig. 46.4) is similar in medium and scale to Seated Tahitian Woman.\n\nThe imposing, fully worked pastel of the crouching Tahitian woman has been described as \u201cone of Gauguin\u2019s most perfect works, . . . deservedly famous for it combines in a sovereign rhythm modeling in the round with the decorative harmony of the picture plane.\u201d Created during his first Tahitian sojourn, the image relates to an 1892 painting Nafea faa ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) (fig. 46.5 [W 454).\n\nOne of only four extant full-scale working drawings from this period, the image is often singled out for its squaring, indicating the use by Gauguin of a traditional method for transferring a design by hand from one surface to another. But the significance of the geometric grid that he superimposed on this, one of his largest and most finished pastels, is greater than that. It demonstrates that Gauguin conceived a pose that he would often repeat in his work (see, for example, fig. 46.6 [cat. 65]) within a formal structure that assures compositional balance and harmony.\n\nThe artist first sketched the young woman lightly in graphite, then traced her contours in brown and blue pastel, after which he filled in the various areas with colors that, in the end, do not appear in Nafea faa ipoipo. In its confident, emphatic contour lines, simplified forms, and distinctive palette (the lavender and yellow pareu, brown and beige skin tones, dark blue hair, brown and blue outlines, green background), the study speaks to the Synthetist principles foregrounding design, form, and color that Gauguin and his circle had promoted in the late 1880s.\n\nThe figure\u2019s body folds in on itself and leans back in a pose reminiscent of Michelangelo\u2019s ignudi on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and was quite possibly inspired by the figure on one knee in Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s Women of Algiers in Their Apartment (fig. 46.7). Traces of an earlier placement of the figure\u2019s right arm suggest that this is the sheet on which on the artist first worked out this favorite figural form.\n\nThis sheet has been heralded as \u201cone of the few drawings by Gauguin related to a painting that can truly be described as \u2018preparatory\u2019\u2013developed specifically with the evolution of his painting in mind.\u201d It has also been said to be based on a sheet of graphite and pen and ink sketches in the Art Institute (fig. 46.8 [cat. 32]), although there is no way to determine for certain which came first. However, in the smaller sketch the figures have been rendered in a kind of shorthand, as if the artist were indicating a motif with which he was very familiar rather than one he was working out in a preliminary way.\n\nWhile it is likely that the artist introduced the grid to help him re-create the figure in Nafea faa ipoipo, it does not resemble the squaring of the Art Institute\u2019s drawing after the artist\u2019s 1882 relief sculpture The Toilette (cat. 4, fig. 4.1). The graphite grid lines on the pastel are sharply ruled and include two diagonal intersections within a drawn box (see fig. 46.9), suggesting that the artist was demonstrating his analysis of the composition as much as he was guiding his process. Klaus Berger noted:\n\nThe network of penciled lines, intended merely as a technical aid in transferring the picture onto the canvas, incidentally helps the observer to check the geometrical abstractions, the curves, straight lines, and right angles, and to comprehend them as a means for achieving the form in which the artist\u2019s vision materializes. Here Gauguin has realized the firmness of composition for the absence of which he reproached his Impressionist friends.\n\nMerete Bodelson elaborated on the Orientalizing abstractions Gauguin pursued from 1889 on, in which each element of the body is \u201cconceived as a decorative unit and drawn with great clarity and beauty.\u201d She went on to describe the vitality of the figure of the Art Institute\u2019s crouching woman with its \u201cliving plasticity which the strong black contour helps to create. It is as though in this pastel he is in absolute command of all his artistic means, and now gathers them for one supreme purpose: to express la vie int\u00e9rieure [inner life].\u201d\n\nWhile there is no denying the pastel\u2019s preparatory role in the creation of Nafea faa ipoipo, the sheet possesses a \u201cstand-alone\u201d quality unlike the three other full-scale preparatory sheets. It would seem that this drawing, probably of his lover Tehamana, was as important to Gauguin as the oil, which was one of the six paintings he chose to exhibit at Durand-Ruel in Paris in November 1893 and to which he assigned his highest price.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alphonse Kann (1870\u20131948), Paris.\n\nJosef Stransky (1872\u20131936), New York, by May 1931.\n\nSold by Wildenstein and Company, New York, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1944.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Cologne, St\u00e4dtische Ausstellungshalle am Aachener Tor, Internationale Kunstausstellung des Sonderbundes Westdeutscher Kunstfreunde und K\u00fcnstler zu C\u00f6ln, May 25\u2013Sept. 30, 1912, cat. 164a, as Tahitanerm\u00e4dchen.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings Old and New, 1946, cat. 20, pl. 25, as Tahitian Woman.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, De David \u00e0 Toulouse-Lautrec: Chefs-d\u2019oeuvres des collections am\u00e9ricaines, 1955, cat. 73, pl. 75, as Tahitienne.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, French Drawings: Masterpieces from Seven Centuries, Oct. 13\u2013Nov. 27, 1955, cat. 165, as Tahitian Woman; Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Dec. 2\u201329, 1955; Detroit Institute of Arts, Jan. 7\u2013Feb. 11, 1956; San Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Mar. 7\u2013Apr. 10, 1956.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Carl O.

(private collection [W 454]). The crouching figure appears in several of Gauguin\u2019s paintings completed during his first Tahitian trip (1891\u201393). The seated woman on the verso relates to the painting Te faaturuma (Reverie) (1891; Worcester Art Museum [W 440]) as well as to a drawing in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, Seated Tahitian Woman from 1891/93 (cat. 35).\n\nCharles F.
