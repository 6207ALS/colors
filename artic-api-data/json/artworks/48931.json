    "description": "<p>This head, which depicts a man crowned with a wreath, might be a portrait of an emperor. His facial features, including almond-shaped eyes, tight-lipped mouth, faint mustache, and neck whiskers, as well as his triangular head, which tapers toward the chin, suggest his possible identification as Gallienus (r. A.D. 253\u201368). This type of wreath, which is composed of grape vines and ivy, was worn by Dionysus, the Greek god of wine and theater. Emperors frequently associated themselves with gods by adopting their attributes, or symbols, as numerous emperors portrayed themselves in the guise of Jupiter (the Greek Zeus), the supreme god of the pantheon.</p>\n",
