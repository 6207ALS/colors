    "description": "<p>In 1915 Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz began submitting pictures to newspaper and exhibition competitions in his native Hungary. He arrived in Paris one decade later greatly attuned to the possibilities of photographs as both unique display objects and mass-media images. This gorgeously printed view of the dancer Magda F\u00f6rstner posing in the Montparnasse studio of sculptor Etienne (Istv\u00e1n) Be\u00f6thy (who, like the photographer and dancer, was also a Hungarian \u00e9migr\u00e9) is a variant of one published by the Berlin leisure magazine <em>Die Dame</em> in 1927 to illustrate a parable of marital infidelity. Clad in a short halter dress with a ruff around her neck, F\u00f6rstner perches alluringly on a couch, her lower legs swiveled outward as if in imitation of a Charleston step. Be\u00f6thy was pursuing an abstracted figural language in sculpture, just as Kert\u00e9sz was in photography, and his statue <em>Direct Action</em>, which appears in a corner next to the sofa, serves as a foil for the latter\u2019s camera work. Interestingly, the published photograph became an icon, and possibly gained its current title only in the 1960s, when Kert\u00e9sz recovered the negative and reprinted it multiple times. The Art Institute\u2019s version, meanwhile, is believed to be unique.</p>\n",
