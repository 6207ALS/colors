    "description": "<p>Conceptual artist Hans\u2013Peter Feldmann is known to trade seriousness for humor and the rarified for the mundane. In the 1960s he began taking photographs while also amassing images made by others; his presentations often mix the two groups indiscriminately. It would presumably be hard for the artist to know what music was playing in a car photographed by someone else, let alone to judge its quality: \u201cgood music,\u201d like fine art, is for the beholder or listener to assess. This evocative set of pictures nevertheless uses the silent, static medium of photography to convey the easy pleasure of listening to music while driving.</p>\n",
