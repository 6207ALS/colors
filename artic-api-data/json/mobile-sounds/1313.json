    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Tiaras were part of a lady's formal evening attire in Edwardian England, often they displayed a dense mass of costly diamonds and pearls.  This unusual and supremely elegant tiara is very different, made of rock crystal, gold and colored enamels, it draws on classical mythology for its design. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: Ghenete Zelleke:  There's a wonderful narrative embodied in this tiara in that you have three roundels, the center one of which shows the figure of Diana, the Goddess of the Hunt and then at left there are some hunting dogs and at the roundel on the right, there's a fleeing stag and this refers to the story of Actaeon coming upon Diana bathing in a clearing in the forest and Diana being so angered at that, she turned Actaeon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs on Actaeon.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Notice how Diana, the dogs and the stage each conform gracefully to their surrounding circular forms.  Their pure gold figures are set off by the rich colors of the enameled trees, grass and sky and the transparent rock crystal band beneath.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE:  It's a piece of poetry in jewelry.</p>\n",
