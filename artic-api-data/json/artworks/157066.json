    "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/44717/abelardo-morell\">Abelardo Morell</a>\u2019s series on books depicts them simultaneously as conveyors of information and as palpable, even multisensory, objects. In 1995 he accepted a position as artist-in-residence at the Boston Athenaeum, an independent library and museum that was founded in 1807. \u201cOne of the big pleasures of this project has come from spending a good amount of time looking at, holding, smelling, and reading a terrific number of skinny, fat, tall, pompous, modest, funny, sad, proud, injured, and radiant books,\u201d he later wrote. Recognizing that the physical features of books affect our perception of their contents, Morell transformed these humble, familiar things in ways that continue to occupy him to this day. He has paid special attention to mechanical reproduction\u2019s mediation of artworks, observing in particular how books alter the reception and understanding of art history through the scale, reflections, and textures they impose on the work depicted.</p>\n",
