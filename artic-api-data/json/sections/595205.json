Blown in a four-part mold, trail decorated, and tooled. Rim, rounded by reheating and infolded, then flares out and is flattened on a free-blown cylindrical neck. The wall spreads out to a convex shoulder, cylindrical body, and a convex bottom with a flat base. On the shoulder are downturned tongues in raised relief, interspersed with pointed darts, bordered by two horizontal raised ridges below the shoulder; an upward-pointing series of the same elements appears on the bottom of the vessel. In between, the main register is decorated with three stylized floral sprays arranged tip to tip and divided by three vertical rods terminating in small ovoid spheres, possibly thyrsoi or staffs. The sprays consist of horizontal stems with two opposing V-shaped sprigs: the first terminates in stylized trefoil ivy leaves; the second in multipointed, stylized grape leaves; and the third in simple drop-shaped leaves and spherical buds, possibly laurel with berries, or perhaps olives. A plain but larger base relief band frames the lower edge of the central register and bends out to form a prominent horizontal ridge and down to the convex bottom of the vessel. The underside of the base has a central dot and two concentric rings in relief in the thickened mold-blown base ring, no pontil mark. A gather of glass was applied at the shoulder and pulled up to the neck beneath the rim, then pulled up again, tooled to form the small thumb rest and arched handle, and folded down and onto the rim. For a zoomable image, see fig. 109.1.\n\nThe jug was broken and repaired on shoulder and body with some losses restored; thick, creamy weathering crust flaking off to reveal brilliant iridescence.\n\nThe mold lines on the vessel are not obvious, but other vessels of this type were blown in a four-part mold, with three top and side elements and a separate piece for the bottom. There are many of these small mold-blown vessels from the first century A.D. that have been described as Sidonian in the literature, not only because of the number that have been excavated in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, but also because of those that over the decades have been attributed (rightly or wrongly) to this region; see the comprehensive publication on the collection of mold-blown glasses in the Toledo Museum of Art.\n\nThis jug type had a wide distribution in the Roman Empire during the first half of the first century A.D. Donald Harden listed the known examples in 1945, and Marianne Stern has added considerably to the listing. Harden believed that these vessels, because of their decorative elements, may have been made in the workshop of the famous Roman glassmaker Ennion. Others have attributed the designs to a less famous but known Cypriot glassmaker, Aristeas.\n\nThere are recently published examples in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Stern, Roman Mold-Blown Glass, p. 166, no. 75; see p. 304 for the profile and line drawing of the design used to help describe what appears to be preserved decoration on this vessel.
