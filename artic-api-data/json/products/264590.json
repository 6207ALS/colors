    "description": "<p>Print developed from Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s <em>Paris Street; Rainy Day, 1877</em>, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. This complex intersection, just minutes away from the Saint-Lazare train station, represents in microcosm the changing urban milieu of late nineteenth-century Paris. In this monumental urban view, which measures almost seven by ten feet and is considered the artist\u2019s masterpiece, Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Print Reproduction </strong></li>\n<li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong> 10.75 in. x 13.75 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Dimensions:</strong> 16 x 20 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Premium cardstock</li>\n</ul>",
