Please come into my heart.\u2019\u201d\n\nSometime afterward, Knight began to work on a hot-air balloon made from bed sheets, on which he planned to write \u201cGod is Love,\u201d as well as the prayer that had facilitated his conversion. This plan failed when the balloon could not get off the ground.\n\nNot one to be discouraged in his quest to spread his newfound faith, Knight began creating Salvation Mountain from adobe and hay bales on the site of his balloon efforts. Visitors have donated some of the funds necessary to purchase the estimated one hundred thousand gallons of paint used to color the structure over the years; California paint stores have contributed the rest.\n\nIn 1994, local government authorities declared the mountain a \u201ctoxic nightmare\u201d and drew up plans to have it carted off and buried in a nuclear waste dump in Nevada. Rallies by Knight\u2019s supporters, as well as his own test results proving that the site was non-hazardous, led the government to back down and allow him to continue building his shrine. He does so daily, except when graciously showing visitors around and giving them postcards inscribed with the Sinner\u2019s Prayer.\n\nBecause Knight considers it an obligation to personally greet each of the fifty to one hundred visitors who come each day, construction now depends on the help of volunteers. His latest project is a museum to house his own work and that of other artists. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
