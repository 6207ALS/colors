    "description": "<p>>Both artists and scientists act on their curiosity by identifying an inquiry and taking steps to discover or express the unknown. In this way, they utilize shared skills of close observation, reasoning and imagining, as well as creative problem solving. The Art Institute of Chicago now offers a student tour and accompanying teacher resource, focused on this intersection of art and science and targeting grades 6-8. This workshop will model aspects of this original tour experience, invite participants to use the museum as a laboratory in order to engage their own curiosity, and consider how to stimulate curious thinking and practice in students.<strong>Registration is required for this program. </strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>For additional Teacher Workshops please visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=&amp;aid=11\" >Teacher Programs Calendar</a>.  </p><p>If you have any questions or special needs, please call 312-443-9092 or email teacherworkshops@artic.edu.</p>",
