    "short_description": "<p>In 1962 at the age of 71, Joseph E. Yoakum (1891\u20131972) reported having a dream that inspired him to draw. Thereafter the retired veteran began a&nbsp;daily&nbsp;practice and over the next 10 years produced some 2,000 works. This exhibition follows the shifting progression of Yoakum\u2019s work, testifying to the rich imagination of an exceptional American artist as well as to the remarkable circumstances that led to his lasting legacy.</p>",
