    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This wooden sculpture of a nineteenth century African-American preacher may have been made before or after the Civil War. It is a portrayal of great dignity and seriousness. Well-dressed in the long coat and soft necktie of the times, the preacher seems lost in meditation, his brow wrinkled with thought. The Bible lies in his lap, open at a page that he is perhaps using as inspiration for a sermon. There is much that remains on unknown about this unusual depiction including the identity and objectives of the artist who carved it. Curator Judy Barter.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: We don\u2019t know the use that this sculpture was put to. But the African-American preacher was a very important figure within the community. It held the black community together. And the African-American religious experience was extremely important as a passive resistance to slavery.</p>\n",
