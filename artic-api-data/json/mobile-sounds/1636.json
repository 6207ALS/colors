    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  Several details of this painting indicate that this is no ordinary mother and baby caught during a quiet moment of intimacy.  The doves nestling behind the pink drapery tell us that the woman is Venus, goddess of love and beauty.  Her child is Cupid, whose magic arrows cause whoever they strike to fall in love with the next person they see.  Cupid's arrows in their quiver lie beside the bed.  The painting was made around 1570 by Luca Cambiaso, then the foremost painter in the wealthy northern Italian city of Genoa.  Cambiaso was deeply influenced by the luminous paintings of Venetian Renaissance artists such as Titian.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:<br>Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  And it's really about exquisite surface and luxury items.  So there's the sense of this silvery light, but there's also this attention to detail, when you look at the way in which there's attention paid to even the tassels on the pillows upon which Venus is reclining, or the sense of light and movement on the draperies that have been pulled apart to reveal the scene.&quot;</p>\n",
