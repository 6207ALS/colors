    "description": "<p>In <em>The Coffee House</em>, Alson Skinner Clark painted Chicago on a winter day, with ice floating down the river and the city\u2019s skyscrapers looming through smoke and fog. The State Street Bridge, with its characteristic curving ironwork, draws the viewer\u2019s eye into the picture. Clark\u2019s scene is in the tradition of the urban realism of the French Impressionists, recalling such pictures as Claude Monet\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16571\"><em>Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare</em></a>. Like Monet, Clark sought to suggest both the ephemeral nature of fog and smoke and the atmosphere\u2019s effect upon the forms of the city.</p>\n",
