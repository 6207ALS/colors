    "description": "<p>A samurai in a blue robe and full armor battles a large demon with red skin whom he has managed to pin to the ground, while a smiling Buddha statue looks on with approval. This print apparently illustrates an obscure legend, according to which the warrior had previously learned of strange happenings at a temple in Kai Province, where he had set up camp for the night. When he went to investigate, he encountered a group of spirits and goblins, the largest of which was in the form of a temple guardian, or ni\u014d. Once the large creature was defeated, the other apparitions, including dancing skeletons and moths, disappeared.</p>\n",
