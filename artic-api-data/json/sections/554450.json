Robinson, 1949.1141\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent deep-blue and opaque white glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. Flared rim, rounded by reheating, tapers into a medium-height cylindrical neck that spreads outward into an ovoid body with a flattened base and no pontil mark. The transparent deep-blue vessel is extremely thin walled with a fine, opaque white trail applied at the base of the neck that spirals down fourteen times around the body and is left in relief. For a zoomable image, see fig. 103.1.\n\nThe bottle is intact, patches of light-brown weathering product with some slight iridescence.\n\nThis vessel shape was a popular container in the Augustan period; see the remarks for cat. 104.\n\nBesides the similarly decorated form blown of transparent pale-yellow-brown glass (cat. 104), there are additional parallels of transparent deep-blue glass with delicate trail decoration in the Princeton University Art Museum and the Corning Museum of Glass. Examples of related vessels blown of different colors are also represented in both collections.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Antonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 211, no. 316; Whitehouse, Roman Glass 2, p. 169, no. 700.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 212, no. 317; Whitehouse, Roman Glass 2, pp. 169\u201370, no. 701.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 103 Bottle, late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D.\n\nfig. 103.1 Bottle (late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D.).
