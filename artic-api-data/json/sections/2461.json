The artist began this sketch with medium-weight lines to establish the figure. He then clarified the final position with heavy outlines, anchoring forms relative to one another in space, such as in the chair seat, groin, hip, and upper arm. Matisse achieved volume by shading with a stump or finger, yielding a soft, gray graphite tone (see fig. 12.1). He erased selectively to eliminate lines that distract from final forms, for example, to the left of the extended leg (see fig. 12.2).\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 12.3); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The composition is cropped at the bottom where the sheet was trimmed within the image area, likely in preparation for mounting. The other edges were likely trimmed at that time as well since all edges are straight cut. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, ivory color and makes another contrasting 2.3 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 36 \u00d7 28.9 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue is evident at the edges of the primary and secondary supports under magnification 80\u00d7.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 12.4).\n\nGraphite with stumping and erasing.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper. This is a medium-quality paper suited to sketching. The sheet displays scattered, pinpoint dark inclusions and a small percentage of poor-quality fibers that have discolored to brown. A fine screen pattern is evident in areas of broad shading under magnification 80\u00d7. The edges are straight cut.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The fiber is of uniform type and color. The sheet is soft and lightly sized. The texture on the recto has been compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 12.5), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light (fig. 12.6).\n\nPrimary support: 31.3 \u00d7 23.8 cm (12 1/4 \u00d7 9 3/8 in.); secondary support: 33.2 \u00d7 26 cm (13 1/8 \u00d7 10 1/4 in.); tertiary support: 38 \u00d7 30.5 cm (15 \u00d7 12 in.).\n\nThe drawing was treated with thymol in November 1965. There is no evidence that the work has undergone other treatment.\n\nThe drawing and mount are in good condition. The primary support has darkened slightly overall due to the discoloration of poor-quality fibers in the sheet. All edges of the tertiary support have darkened to brown.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Stieglitz (Jan. 1, 1864\u2013July 13, 1946), New York, probably by late Feb. 1908\u2013July 13, 1946.\n\nBy descent to Alfred Stieglitz Estate, New York, July 13, 1946\u2013Nov. 9, 1949.\n\nBequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 9, 1949.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, The Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, An Exhibition of Drawings, Lithographs, Water-Colors, and Etchings by M.

Sarah Greenough to the author, email correspondence, Jan. 7, 2016. These are framer\u2019s marks, likely written by George Of, a framer used frequently by Alfred Stieglitz for his gallery, the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, 291 Fifth Avenue, or by a Mr. Dunn, Of\u2019s business manager. Comparison with invoices from Of to Stieglitz dated June 12, 1913, illuminates the meaning of the abbreviated inscription (see \u201cMounting Evidence\u201d). The frame is indicated by a fraction measurement (1/2), possibly referring to the profile dimension, followed by \u201cflat pol,\u201d perhaps indicating a flat polish finish. This is followed by the rebate dimensions, in this instance 12 \u00d7 15 in., the size to which the tertiary support has been trimmed.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 12 Standing Female Nude with Chair, 1907.\n\nfig. 12.1 Detail of Matisse\u2019s Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907) showing stumped charcoal tone along the bent leg and groin.
