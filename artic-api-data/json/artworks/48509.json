    "description": "<p>In 1969, during a vacation in Rome, Willem de Kooning was invited by the American sculptor Herzl Emanuel to his nearby bronze foundry. While there, de Kooning began working with clay and, over the course of the next couple of weeks, made a series of small-scale figures, one of which Emanuel cast in bronze. Encouraged by the sculptor Henry Moore, de Kooning continued creating works that he called \u201cpainting in three dimensions.\u201d The heavy, exaggerated form of <em>Head #3</em> recalls the contorted figures from de Kooning\u2019s paintings. Reflecting on his sculptures, the artist stated: \u201cIn some ways, clay is even better than oil. You can work and work on a painting but you can\u2019t start over again with the canvas like it was before you put the first stroke down. . . . But with clay . . . if I don\u2019t like what I did, or I changed my mind, I can break it down and start over. It\u2019s always fresh.\u201d</p>\n",
