    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This work is called \u201cForest and Sun\u201d, massive closely grouped trees emerge from the darkness in the center of the painting. They are split by the perfect circular form of the sun. This painting is by Max Ernst, a World War I veteran who would become involved with the Dada movement in the 1920s. The Dadaists question fundamental aspects of art-making. Their revolutionary ideas later became part of the foundation of the surrealist of which this and other works in this gallery relating to the unconscious and to chance are apart. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Ernst was very interested in the unconscious and part of his way of getting to that unconscious to use that sort of untrained, untapped wild creative spirit was by using techniques that came from doodling that came from automatic writing, from scribbling, from chance and spontaneity. Ernst would look for inspiration in many different places. Sometimes it had to do with found materials, bits of leather or sandpaper, but his techniques were also unusual. And he would find inspiration from the things around him. For example, rubbing the floorboard with paint of some kind of other material to bring the relief surface and the pattern of the floor onto the canvas as a starting kind of inspiration for the beginning of a work.</p>\n",
