His aim, as he expressed it at the time, was to create synthetic characterizations of people and objects. Involving the use of sketches, copies, and studies from many different sources, this method was a radical departure from the technique of working outside, directly before the motif, espoused by many of Gauguin\u2019s Impressionist contemporaries.\n\nAlthough this sheet of studies dates from the artist\u2019s first trip to Tahiti, its reductive description of figures represents an extension of the innovative working process Gauguin had established in Brittany. In Tahiti, in addition to drawing from direct observation, Gauguin consulted postcards he had purchased from souvenir shops and referred to visual materials he had brought with him from France.\n\nThis parchment sheet features sketches of Tahitians in a variety of positions. Gauguin indicated each with a simple outline of his or her pose: sitting, crouching, or standing. There is no modeling or hatching to suggest volume; the simplified forms seem flattened on the page. Yet, as in other contemporaneous drawings from his Tahitian sketchbooks, Gauguin worked over the pen sketches in places with light washes of watercolor. The inks he used here have faded significantly: the images were originally much brighter and the outlines stronger, giving the sheet a more decorative quality.\n\nHere Gauguin drew on parchment, which, while not an unheard-of practice at the time, was rare for him. It is unclear how he procured the material, but employing such a high-quality support for casual work seems almost subversive. Perhaps the artist wished to emphasize the importance of his cursory observations, although it is equally possible that the sheet was all that was available.\n\nThe quick typography of figural forms here may make this piece one of the \u201cdocuments\u201d that Gauguin referred to in many letters he sent from Polynesia to friends and family. For example, in November 1891, shortly after his arrival in Mataiea, Tahiti, he wrote to Paul S\u00e9rusier, \u201cNot one painting as yet, but a great deal of research that can lead to something, many notes that will be of use to me for a long time, I hope, in France.\u201d Gauguin saw such sketches as comprising a visual lexicon\u2014images of people, poses, flora, landscapes, and architecture\u2014that he could combine and synthesize to provide content for many of his subsequent works.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Mme.
