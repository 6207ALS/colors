    "description": "Artist Mel Bochner became a writer, he says, almost by accident. In 1965, as a young artist in New York, he was out of a job; Arts Magazine paid him $2.50 for every review he turned in, whether they published it or not; a month of review-writing paid his rent\u2014$28.00 a month. His reviews and articles provoked a range of unexpected reactions. \u201cAt that time, artists who wrote were looked at suspiciously, as if writing somehow tainted their visual practice,\u201d he writes. A painter friend attacked him publicly for \u201cjoining the enemy.\u201d Bochner soon began testing the boundary between writing-as-criticism and writing-as-visual-art. Solar System &amp; Rest Rooms collects both Bochner's writings on art and his writings as art, offering more than fifty pieces\u2014reviews, art criticism, theoretical texts, interviews, catalog statements, notecards, and his groundbreaking \u201cmagazine interventions\u201d\u2014many reproduced in facsimile.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.5 x 11 in</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 240</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 120 b&amp;w</li></ul>",
