The lithograph depicts a workman named Debraine cutting grass in the garden of the Whistlers\u2019 home on the rue du Bac in Paris. The drawing was probably one of two new subjects sent to the Ways on July 22, about one week after he sent another sketch made in his garden, The Garden Porch (cat. 88). The first specific mention of the image appears in Whistler\u2019s letter to his printers of July 23, where he refers to it as Le Faucheur (letter 97). The artist wrote again on July 30, urging the Ways to proceed in printing sets of twenty-five impressions of each of his recent drawings, but telling them to exclude the \u201clast one of The Reaper, \u2018Le faucheur\u2019\u201d (letter 99). Without explaining what troubled him about the drawing, he simply wrote that he disliked the image and wanted it \u201cput aside for the moment\u201d until he had decided whether \u201cit ought to be destroyed or may be saved.\u201d Whistler continued to make transfer drawings of other subjects, and eventually decided not to bother with revisions to The Man with a Sickle. In a letter of August 14, he instructed the Ways to destroy the image along with The Garden Porch (letter 104). He also asked them to pull a proof from each of the canceled stones before they were erased. If such a proof was mailed to the artist as evidence of the cancelation, it was not found in his estate, and its present location is unknown. It is reasonable to assume that the printers carried out Whistler\u2019s orders, because impressions of this image are very rare.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove Japanese vellum (310 \u00d7 231 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (318 \u00d7 206 mm), signed.
