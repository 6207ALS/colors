    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This 1912 clock is a splendid example of interior design of the Prairie School, a style that was a Midwestern variant on designs favored by the English Arts and Crafts movement, which shunned excessive ornamentation in favor of geometric patterns.  The rectangular severity of the mahogany case, with its thin strips of brass inlay, is enlivened by a pierced panel of curving, plantlike forms.  The geometric wood extensions, or finials, atop the case may have been inspired by Japanese temple architecture.  The most famous practitioner of the Prairie School style was the Chicagoan Frank Lloyd Wright, who wanted a purely new American architecture free of Old Europe.  His colleague, architect George Grant Elmslie, designed this tall clock for the Henry Babson House in Riverside, Illinois, just a few miles outside the city limits of Chicago.  The only imported parts of this clock are the German-made chimes.  Everything else was made in the United States.  In keeping with the architect-designed objects, this clock was intended not only for a specific house, but for a specific place in that house.  The house has since been demolished, but pictures in a magazine published in 1915 showed that the clock stood near a fireplace of similar design, which contained the Elmslie-designed andirons, or firedogs, also on display in this gallery.</p>\n",
