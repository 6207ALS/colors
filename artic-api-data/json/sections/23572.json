By pairing a hyperrealistic style with incongruous spatial representation, the artist aimed to control the viewer\u2019s experience: \u201cI\u2019m trying to lead the observer back, sideways, up or down into the picture, to make him feel tossed in every direction, to make him realize that objects are at war, that between them there is constant movement, tension and conflict.\u201d\n\nAlbright\u2019s realistic style emphasizes the spatial disparity inherent in his paintings and gives the impression of movement. The artist achieved these effects in carefully calibrated studio conditions, which allowed him to control lighting and portray objects from varied vantage points and distances. Although some basics regarding his technique were documented during his life, there has been no systematic technical analysis of his works and materials. For this study, a selection of thirteen works from throughout the artist\u2019s career were examined and imaged, and the results were compared with published reports. These results, together with archival research and the artist\u2019s notebooks, inform this overview of Albright\u2019s intense working practices, which includes examinations of his studio environment, his accumulation of props and models, his choice of media, and his planning, execution, and framing of his paintings. Like any magician, Albright had specific methods for creating his illusions. Some he developed early in his career and maintained, while others took shape as he matured.\n\nAn examination of Albright\u2019s works and notebooks quickly reveals that he exerted a great deal of control over his art-making, beginning with the environment in which he painted. He had several studios over the course of his career, and in all of them he focused exceptional attention on lighting conditions. Albright initially shared a studio with his father and twin brother in Warrenville, Illinois, where he preferred to work on the balcony. In 1929 he built his own studio on the property and tailored the space to suit his needs. An image from 1930 (fig. 1) of the artist working on Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (cat. 7) shows the slatted coverings on the skylights and room-darkening window shades that he installed to precisely control the amount and direction of the light. In conversations with his biographer, Michael Croydon, Albright cited Caravaggio\u2019s studio as inspiration, including a preference for matte-black walls and limited lighting. Sometime after 1930, Albright \u201cblackened the studio walls, using three dozen eggs as a paint binding medium to prevent light reflections.\u201d Additionally, during the execution of That Which I Should Have Done, I Did Not Do (The Door; hereafter The Door) (cat. 13), he apparently cut into both the floor and the ceiling of this studio to accommodate this tall work.\n\nAlbright continued to use this studio until a few months after he married and moved. In 1948, he purchased a building with good northern light at 1773 Ogden Avenue in Chicago and hired architect Andrew Rebori to convert it to a studio, in part attempting to replicate the controlled skylights from his Warrenville studio (see fig. 2). In photographs of the artist working on Poor Room\u2014There Is No Time, No End, No Today, No Yesterday, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever, and Forever, and Forever without End (hereafter Poor Room cat. 17) that date to around 1961, the Ogden Avenue studio has matte black walls and a series of covered skylights and shuttered windows.\n\nIn 1963, when the artist learned that the Ogden Avenue building was to be demolished, he relocated to Woodstock, Vermont. In a 1967 article, the gallerist and curator Katherine Kuh described the Woodstock studio as \u201can authentic Albright landmark meticulously tailored to his specific needs,\u201d with windows designed so that \u201cinch by inch, separate glass sections can be regulated to control the light.\u201d Images of the artist working on The Vermonter (If Life Were Life There Would Be No Death) (1966\u201377; Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH [see fig. 3]) show the Woodstock studio carefully organized and dimly lit (see fig. 4). The light from the north-facing windows and skylight was so meticulously controlled that the studio resembled a basement.\n\nBeginning in some of his earliest notebooks, Albright occasionally sketched ideas for various studio furniture and designs which would allow him to control his environment, the subjects he painted, and his methods of painting. Some of Albright\u2019s inventions attempted to solve complicated problems, for example, painting objects from a variety of vantage points. Describing himself as \u201cprobably the first artist who ever found out he had a pair of legs,\u201d the artist sought to make himself, his canvas, and his models movable, which he required to achieve the complicated fusion of perspectives within his compositions. Albright embraced the idea of incorporating movement in his pictures early in his career. \u201cOne must think all around an object all the time in order to make it appear solid. That\u2019s how I happen to build such elaborate sets for my paintings. The objects, or call them models, I work with are on platforms on casters, on all kinds of movable stands so that I can change their positions, change the light on them, change their relationships at will.\u201d His early notebooks are filled with observations concerning the perception of objects as the observer moves around, closer to, or away from them as well as the effect of such movement on color and shading and the balance of movement within a composition.\n\nThis interest in motion in his pictures is evident early in his career, often with a single object, like the handkerchief in Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, portrayed in a way that seems discordant from the rest of the painting (see fig. 5). Painted while draped over a platform, the handkerchief sits strangely in space amid the almost abstract patterning of the carpet. As documented in the artist\u2019s notebooks, Albright began planning these differing vantage points individually. For example, a notebook sketch for The Door (fig. 6) annotates the angle of view for each of the hanging sections of ribbon from the wreath. By the time the work was finished, the key and the individual flowers were each portrayed from a different vantage point. As the compositions grew more complex, Albright required working diagrams, like that for Poor Room (fig. 7), which enabled him to plan and track the changing perspectives. Practically speaking, this could mean that an object was viewed from a particular angle and distance with a specific concentration and direction of light. More often than not, it also meant that the canvas itself was oriented a certain way, be it upside down, sideways, tilted back in space, or some combination thereof. These diagrams evolved throughout the painting stage, often requiring the artist to make more than one per painting.\n\nAlbright designed a working strainer (visible in images of the work in process at the Ogden Avenue studio) to hold the Poor Room canvas during painting; the triptych-like construction allowed the sides of the work to flex backward (see fig. 8). A rear view of the support shows that it was constructed from three individual strainers, one for each third of the artwork, attached top and bottom to lengths of metal piping that allowed the sides to be angled to suit the artist\u2019s needs for a particular section of the composition (see fig. 9). It is assumed that this was a working strainer and that, once finished, the canvas was stretched on a more traditional secondary support. In these images, the work rests on what appears to be a homemade or artist-modified easel featuring a triangular base on casters and a slotted mechanism on the rear leg that allows the painting to tilt backward.\n\nAlbright recorded sketches in his notebooks for various easel designs beginning in 1924 (see fig. 10). While there are no notes or images to suggest that any of the early designs were ever fabricated, the artist noted that one design was constructed in the fall of 1971 (see fig. 11) and was featured with the unfinished Vermonter at an exhibition at the Strauss Gallery at Dartmouth College. This is likely the design that appears in studio images of the 1970s (see fig. 12). The easel features a square metal base on casters with a single vertical member that allows for height adjustments. A kind of plate used to mount the painting appears to be attached to a mechanism using a ball bearing, which allows a painting to be rotated to any angle (see fig. 13). Eventually Albright modified the easel so he could attach a magnifying glass to use when painting.\n\nWhen looking for live models for his works, Albright chose deliberately, sometimes selecting from among his acquaintances and neighbors or hiring nonprofessionals via newspaper advertisements. He did only one commissioned portrait, Portrait of Mary Block (cat. 20), and one posthumous portrait, of his late father-in-law, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (cat. 21). Later in her life, Ida Rogers, who sat for Albright\u2019s Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, recalled responding to a newspaper advertisement placed by Albright and his twin brother, also an artist, and being interviewed and chosen from a number of candidates. As art historian Robert Cozzolino observed, given the lengthy amount of time one could spend sitting for the painter, the model-artist arrangement was essentially a relationship agreement. As documented by curator Jan van der Marck, Albright painted at an average pace of \u201cone half a square inch each five hour working day.\u201d Still, despite the precaution of conducting initial interviews, Albright did not always find his models or his relationships with them satisfactory in the long term.\n\nAfter choosing a subject and costume, Albright carefully selected the surrounding materials, judiciously adjusting, distressing, and building items when he could not find what he envisioned. The considered assembly of components for Albright\u2019s Door, for example, is well documented. For his other epic painting, Poor Room, the path to a final setup was slightly more circuitous; he initially intended the work as a self-portrait, provisionally titled The Window, as shown in his notebooks of the period (see fig. 14). According to Croydon, the artist imagined himself in red flannel, eating an egg, and seen from the window of an old building. It took Albright about five months to compile this assemblage. He chose the bricks individually from a yard in Aurora, Illinois, for their color and texture and brought them back to his shared studio in Warrenville. Albright numbered each brick and laid them out on the floor to test the arrangement before applying the mortar. At an early stage in the process, he was photographed with the original setup and himself as the model (fig. 15) for an article on the Albright family of artists.\n\nEventually, he expanded the setup, putting the entire scene on casters, and built tension around the lantern near the center, tipping it to hint at an imminent fire (see fig. 16). Albright papered and distressed the wall behind the window and added various other props, including an ashen baby shoe and his mother\u2019s corset. Many items were repurposed from earlier works, including the bureau from Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, the chair from Three Love Birds (cat. 8), and the pocket chain and cherubs from the table legs in Picture of Dorian Gray (cat. 18; the cherubs were later painted out but are visible in a 1956 image of the work in an unfinished state [fig. 17]). Not finding a window to his liking, the artist took fragments of broken glass and wood and constructed his own, giving the construction a slight torque. As he did for The Door, Albright began The Window/Poor Room with a hand model. However, once the final position was determined, a plaster cast served as a substitute (fig. 18). The finished construction was a sprawling diorama of dilapidated, lopsided objects on a large, moveable platform that took up a good portion of the artist\u2019s studio (see fig. 19).\n\nOnce his stage was set, Albright made or gathered the materials of his art-making. The artist often prepared his canvases himself, preferring those of medium to medium-fine weights. Of the thirteen works examined for this publication, eight appear to be artist-primed with a zinc-based ground. The late Pray for These Little Ones (Perforce They Live Together) (cat. 24) is an outlier among the works studied, and was executed on an unprimed silk support. Albright\u2019s grounds tend to be white or almost white and extremely thin, sometimes barely coating the tops of the canvas weave. Marilyn Robb described the preparation of Poor Room as \u201ca single coat of zinc white and glue, put on thick, then scraped off with a palette knife.\u201d Although not visible in the verso image of Poor Room, somewhat linear, parallel striations created by the movement of the palette knife are visible from the verso on both Showcase Doll (cat. 12; see fig. 20) and The Door, suggesting the grounds were scraped or worked with the palette knife while still wet or pliable. The arduous scraping action of the palette knife during ground application abraded some threads, resulting in the kind of hairy texture seen in Three Love Birds (see fig. 21). The preparation on this painting also has a gritty texture, suggesting that his homemade ground mixture was either poorly blended or not entirely fresh, possibly containing partially dry clumps (see fig. 22).\n\nThe artist appears to have preferred commercially made stretchers as secondary supports for his works, but at times he made his own strainers. Showcase Doll has a four-member keyable stretcher stamped with \u201cFredrix,\u201d and Portrait of Mary Block bears the stamp of Devoe Artists\u2019 Materials. The Lineman (cat. 3), Self-Portrait (cat. 14), and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d (cat. 22) all appear to retain their original commercial stretchers, although none bear any indication of the manufacturer or distributor. The large, thin format of The Door may have required an artist-made strainer (see fig. 23). The strainer\u2019s initial construction comprises four butt-joined pieces; the somewhat awkward and uneven cutting of the wood, especially noticeable along the underside/inside edge of the top member (see fig. 24), supports the hypothesis that it is handmade. Onto this basic, four-member frame, four more pieces were added: two doubled the depth of the top and bottom members, and two, placed as crossbars, provide structural support.\n\nFor the most part, Albright did not complete traditional preparatory drawings, preferring instead to make working diagrams of his compositions after he had gathered his props. These diagrams included not only the placement of specific objects but also their angle of viewing, the lighting conditions, and the canvas orientation. Two known outliers to his general practice are the extant drawings (fig. 25 and fig. 26) related to his posthumous portrait of Joseph Medill Patterson, drawn after a photograph, both of which he gridded for transfer. Interestingly, the numbered grid lines in the more schematic drawing do not correspond with those visible in the infrared image of the final painting, suggesting that there is another drawing or source, now lost. The faintly visible grid lines in the fully shaded drawing, however, appear to correlate with those in the painting (fig. 27). Furthermore, in 1963 Albright allowed this painting to be photographed and published in an unfinished state, when only the subject\u2019s face was complete (fig. 28). Sweeping lines of underdrawing show the artist working through the position of the body and hands. The hands were not yet gridded at the time. It seems here that the gridding was in service of the painting stage of the work rather than the drawing. Although Mary Block sat for her portait, the infrared image (fig. 29) shows that her face is similarly gridded, suggesting that he supplemented with a drawing or photograph. Although several works in this study were painted directly from live models, including The Lineman, Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, Picture of Dorian Gray, Self-Portrait, and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter,\u201d reflected-infrared or transmitted-infrared imaging did not reveal a grid on any of the other eleven works examined.\n\nIn most cases, rather than work on a detailed preparatory drawing, Albright preferred to draw directly on the canvas. Many firsthand accounts of Albright\u2019s technique mention his preference for a highly detailed underdrawing. Charcoal is visible on the unfinished paintings; he also left it purposely visible on some works, including The Temptation of Saint Anthony (cat. 19; see fig. 30) and Poor Room (see fig. 31). In fact, regarding Poor Room, Albright remarked, \u201cI didn\u2019t finish\u2014this thing is in charcoal, which is all right, I think. It\u2019s kind of nice to leave a little piece that way so they can see how you work.\u201d Beginning in the late 1920s, the Albrights, dissatisfied with the available charcoal, began making their own under the brand name American Artists Charcoal Company (see fig. 32), firing swamp maple they acquired in Grafton, Illinois, in kilns in the backyard of their Warrenville studios. Although the company folded in the mid-1930s, Albright apparently continued to use his own charcoal well after that.\n\nThe underdrawing of The Lineman is summary in comparison with those of the unfinished Three Love Birds and subsequent Showcase Doll, both of which illustrate the extensive level of underdrawing in Albright\u2019s mature style. He could spend several months to more than a year completing it, and this long process sometimes caused complications with his models. Three Love Birds, for example, remained unfinished as the model, a young Greek girl, grew more than an inch during the eleven months of drawing and then left to get married. With The Vermonter, a project encompassing two discarded underdrawings on canvas in addition to the final work on panel, the model passed away during the twelve years Albright took to complete the portrait. In order to finish the work, the artist bought the model\u2019s clothes from his widow and constructed a dummy replacement model (see fig. 33). More characteristic of his working methods, the underdrawings for The Door and Poor Room took thirteen and seventeen months, respectively.\n\nThe two works commissioned for film projects, Picture of Dorian Gray and The Temptation of Saint Anthony, were completed in a much shorter time frame, eleven and four months, respectively. As expected, the underdrawings for both pictures are much more summary. As John P. Murphy discusses, director Albert Lewin commissioned Picture of Dorian Gray for his 1945 film of that name (based on the Oscar Wilde classic), in which the portrait would suddenly appear in dramatic Technicolor at the end of the black-and-white picture. As preparatory research for the work, Albright studied the source material thoroughly, making extensive notes and copying quotations into his notebooks. He apparently also visited asylums and hospitals for visual examples of disease. After renovations to the space that would serve as his Hollywood studio, the assembly and distressing of various props\u2014including a few dressed mannequins to stand in when both Hurd Hatfield (the actor playing Gray) and his double, Skeet Noyes, were unavailable, and the acquisition of studio klieg lights so the work would be painted under the same conditions in which it would be filmed, Albright began drawing on his pre-primed canvas. Knowing the compressed schedule of production, Albright and Lewin discussed which areas of the painting would be featured in close-ups during filming so that the painter could concentrate his efforts accordingly. An in-process image of the artist working on Picture of Dorian Gray (fig. 34) confirms what is visible in the reflected-infrared and transmitted-infrared images (fig. 35): the underdrawing is largely schematic, outlining various forms, their shadows, and auras, and does not contain the minute details and comprehensive shading seen in those of the other works.\n\nExecuted as part of a competition for a featured spot in another of Lewin\u2019s films, The Private Affairs of Bel Ami (1947), Albright\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony was inspired by the colors the artist saw in melted glass after a fire at a neighbor\u2019s house. Apparently created without a specially designed setup, The Temptation of Saint Anthony is somewhat of an outlier in Albright\u2019s oeuvre, showing the artist relying much on his own imagination and recollections from previous models. The reflected- and transmitted-infrared images show a series of stray lines that remained undeveloped throughout the work as if Albright were composing as he drew (see fig. 36). In various places throughout the work, some of these lines and false starts remain visible in the finished painting (see fig. 37).\n\nThe unfinished works indicate something of the technical nuance Albright applied to his underdrawings. Fine lines, possibly in graphite, are visible on Three Love Birds, suggesting the artist may have begun with a loose, schematic kind of drawing in a finer material to first establish his composition (see fig. 38). Multiple shades and consistencies of black throughout the unfinished works suggest a variety of black media, not solely Albright\u2019s studio-made natural charcoal. The smaller, finer particles visible in areas of all three unfinished works suggest the use of fabricated charcoal (see fig. 39). The prevalence of bone black in the drawing material for Showcase Doll may suggest the use of a black pastel or similar material in addition to charcoal. The deeper, almost velvety quality of the material in some areas also points to possible pastel (see fig. 40). In addition to the various black materials, the artist appears to have used some colored materials, including brown and ochre, possibly pastels, present in Three Love Birds (see fig. 41), and white, probably also pastel based on its appearance, present in both Showcase Doll (see fig. 40) and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d (see fig. 42).\n\nShowcase Doll also shows the artist working the charcoal with a brush after initial application. Parallel striations in the drawing show the artist using a stiff-bristle brush or sanding agent to lighten the shading in a specific area (see fig. 43); the visual result is akin to extremely fine hatching and crosshatching. In both Three Love Birds and Poor Room, the artist smoothed some areas of the underdrawing, perhaps with water and a brush, to create a wash-like effect (see fig. 44). This method appears to create a characteristic pattern on the verso of the canvas (see fig. 45), where the composition on the face is reduced to a kind of geometric blocking in of forms. This is also apparent on a 1955 verso image of Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, suggesting the use of a similar method there (see fig. 46). In the quickly executed Temptation of Saint Anthony, Albright appears to have thinly applied toning layers directly over the underdrawing throughout much of the composition, some of which similarly is visible on the reverse (see fig. 47). The unfinished works suggest that the sequence of steps between drawing and painting was somewhat fluid, as Albright went back over painted areas to quickly draw basic compositional changes (fig. 48 and fig. 49).\n\nOnce the drawing was completed and thoroughly modeled, Albright applied a fixative to the work, which allowed him to paint over the drawing without smearing it. In this period, the fixatives most commonly in use were based on new \u201csynthetics,\u201d or modified organics, like cellulose nitrate, while older techniques utilized dilute resins such as shellac or mastic or aqueous solutions of starch, gum arabic, or casein. Though his earliest use of a fixative recorded by an eyewitness dates to 1950, Albright was clearly using a fixative in all his works, as there is no smearing of the charcoal underdrawings when painted over. Furthermore, close examination in specular light reveals the slight sheen of sprayed fixative on the unfinished works (see fig. 50). Hilaire Hiler, in his 1937 Painter\u2019s Pocket Book of Methods and Materials, recommends as a fixative a cellulose nitrate solution commercially known as Zapon or Duco, nicknamed \u201cbanana solution\u201d because of its characteristic odor resulting from the presence of amyl acetate in the formula. Analysis of the canvases indicated cellulose nitrate as the fixative on Showcase Doll, Poor Room, and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d; the fixative for Three Love Birds and The Temptation of Saint Anthony may be gum based.\n\nAlbright was able to attain such a degree of detail by painting in discrete, adjacent areas worked up to completion in very thin, often wet-on-wet layers using extremely fine brushes; this pattern is best observed in the unfinished works. Albright remarked on several occasions that he preferred Windsor &amp; Newton brushes, which at one time were available as small in sizes as 0000, and he sometimes cut them down further, to a few hairs or even a single hair. Images of the artist at work often show him armed with a handful of such brushes (see fig. 51). Details abound in Albright\u2019s paintings that suggest the use of tiny brushes (see fig. 52 and fig. 53), but not as many suggest brushes with so few hairs (see fig. 54). Albright would have had to alter his paint mixtures, likely adding oil and spirits to thin them to the appropriate consistency, in order paint smoothly with such a miniscule brush.\n\nWorking on discrete areas of a painting at different times requires some method of keeping track of one\u2019s place, both on the model and on the painting. Throughout his career, Albright accomplished this by using small stickers or colored pins on his models and placing corresponding dots of paint on his canvases. The artist began this practice early in his career, and in many cases, these colored dots remain visible in the final paintings, including The Door (see fig. 55). Colored dots on some paintings still have corresponding pins or stickers on their respective still-life setups. For the complex painting Poor Room, Albright employed stickers in several different colors (see fig. 56) and also repurposed the numbers with which he had labeled the individual bricks when he moved studios (see fig. 57). In the case of Study for \u201cThe Vermonter,\u201d for example, dots on the figure\u2019s coat correspond to colored pins in the dummy the artist created with his deceased sitter\u2019s clothes.\n\nIn order to properly execute the colors and textures Albright treasured on his models, the artist chose his paint materials carefully. With tiny brushes in hand, Albright painted from a wooden palette with an array of colored pools of paint, each \u201cno bigger than a pimple.\u201d Albright recalled that, beginning during his studies at the School of the Art Institute, he ground his own pigments on a granite slab. Later in his career, he seems to have alternated between buying ready-made materials by companies such as Blockx (linked to both The Door and Poor Room), and making his own paints, sometimes grinding dry pigments in poppy or walnut oil, which yellowed less than linseed oil. Albright expressed some dissatisfaction with commercially made oil paints due to the amount of fillers included, asserting he could make colors \u201cthree times as strong\u201d as the ready-made varieties but often found the process too labor intensive and time consuming. In some works, such as The Lineman and Self-Portrait, the presence of chunks of pigment particles may be a clue that he was mixing his own paints (see fig. 58 and fig. 59).\n\nAlbright was known to make separate palettes for different elements in his compositions, storing them in a mixture of water and turpentine to keep them wet between sessions. He also stored larger quantities of specific mixtures in tubes for use in bigger projects. For Portrait of Mary Block, the artist mixed specialized shades for his sitter\u2019s lipstick, nail polish, and face powder, while for the final painting of The Vermonter, he ground tubefuls of colors for the jacket, cap, shirt, and background. In preparation for Poor Room, Albright ordered one of each of the eighty available Blockx colors. Both his notebooks and analysis of the works support the notion that, while he had a varied palette, it often included several shades of the same pigment. All thirteen paintings analyzed include zinc white, cadmium yellow, iron oxide/earth pigments, cadmium red, viridian, and bone or ivory black. Among other common pigments are titanium white, red lake, cobalt blue, and cobalt violet (see the table of pigments used in selected Albright paintings [fig. 60]).\n\nThe artist\u2019s notes indicate that his pigment mixtures could be extremely complex, often including \u201ca touch of all the primary colors red, blue, yellow, + also green, purple, orange,\u201d with or without black and white, or a small amount of all the available shades of a color, such as yellow \u201cand also the earth colors,\u201d in a single mixture. The complicated nature of Albright\u2019s pigment mixtures is apparent in cross sections of his works. A cross section from the chair at left in Three Love Birds (fig. 61), for example, shows a pink-red layer above the ground that includes zinc white, titanium white, red lake, and ultramarine blue, as well as cadmium orange, zinc yellow, and bone black; this is followed by a white layer primarily consisting of zinc and titanium whites with cadmium red and/or orange, ultramarine blue, and bone black. The dark, almost black upper layer is primarily bone black with cadmium red and zinc white.\n\nThough Albright was not known as a colorist, these complicated pigment mixtures speak to his specific use of color in his paintings. In some of his notebooks of the 1930s, Albright began experimenting with what he called \u201cafter colors.\u201d After staring at brightly colored flowers in the sunlight for a few minutes, Albright would close his fatigued eyes and record the succession of colors he perceived as his eyes recovered. When working under the bright klieg lights he used during the painting of Picture of Dorian Gray, Albright made a series of what he called \u201ccolor wands\u201d (see fig. 62). Matte black handles with brightly colored geometric shapes at one end, the easily portable wands functioned much like the flowers in producing the effect of residual color perceptions. Albright experimented with these after colors, which were usually closely related to the wand color\u2019s complementary shade, throughout the rest of his career to create halos around his objects, thereby intensifying the viewer\u2019s perception of both the original color and the after color. Albright\u2019s use of these after colors is apparent throughout the background of Picture of Dorian Gray (see fig. 63).\n\nWhile the unfinished paintings often show that Albright worked through his compositions in the drawing stages, technical examination of his paintings has revealed that, despite his elaborate and time-consuming underdrawings, many of his works also underwent major changes in the painting stages. The artist\u2019s own words offer conflicting viewpoints: he frequently asserted that he made no changes once he \u201cworked on a thing,\u201d but he also contended that when he composed a work, he left \u201croom for future changes in philosophy, for future changes in position, of light, even for the addition or removal of various objects.\u201d It seems that he often adjusted compositional elements. For example, in The Lineman, Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, The Door, Picture of Dorian Gray, The Temptation of Saint Anthony, Portrait of Mary Block, Poor Room, and Captain Joseph Medill Patterson, the hands, both as part of a figural composition and disembodied, were adjusted between the drawing and painting stages. While in some works, such as The Door, there seems to be a single point of change (see fig. 64), other paintings have undergone major compositional reworking.\n\nOne example of this extensive reworking is Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida. She remained largely unchanged, but the artist dramatically altered the furniture and accessories around her (see fig. 65). The hand mirror was originally much larger and rounder, its handle protruding from Ida\u2019s hand at a steeper angle and extending past the neckline of her garment. There were also changes to the immediate foreground, in front of the shadow of the figure and chair, where a fold of the carpet or some other fabric once extended into the picture plane, almost touching the foreground left leg of the chair. Slight variations in the color and texture of the paint in this area, as well as those around the mirror, hint to these compositional alterations even under normal viewing conditions. The X-ray reveals that the right side of the painting, currently displaying a small bureau with an array of objects strewn across its surface, was originally a square, cloth-covered table, possibly the one seen in the left foreground of a 1930 image of the artist with the work in his Warrenville studio (fig. 66). The table is more square than the bureau that replaced it, appearing narrower and extending further back in space, with the far corner barely visible inches from the exterior margin.\n\nApparently during the switch from a covered table to a bureau with drawer, the artist decided to extend the perimeter of the work on all sides. The right side was extended by more than an inch and shows evidence of painted-over tack holes and pronounced cusping from a former attachment; the newer and currently visible small dresser at the right extends to the current edge. It is unclear at what stage some of the items on top of the bureau were moved: the comb was originally placed closer to the figure, just above the knee at a similarly precarious angle; the vase was more bulbous and fluted; and the case for the powder puff was pushed back behind the comb and closed. Once moved into its current position on the bureau, the case remained closed, as seen in both the X-ray and an undated photograph of the work in progress (fig. 67). Less obvious is the artist\u2019s alteration of the folds of the fabric near the bottom of the composition, below the back leg of the chair, in which he painted out much of the original upper portion and continued the remaining area over the extended edge. The extended edges, especially along the bottom carpeted areas, appear less detailed and are largely covered by the frame. When the work is viewed unframed, these areas are slightly different in color and texture and seem incongruous with the rest of the work, but they do appear to be by the artist\u2019s hand. There were also slight adjustments to the figure\u2019s fingertips and to the hem, neckline, and patch placement on her garment.\n\nPoor Room is probably the most well documented of Albright\u2019s paintings in terms of its execution, with a series of changes to the composition apparently dictated by both circumstance and changes in philosophy. Albright was interviewed several times during its making, and the work was photographed at different stages of development. The earliest images mostly concern the original setup as a self-portrait (see fig. 68). Although the initial underdrawing was finished before the artist moved to the Ogden Avenue studio, it is unclear how much of the work, if any, was painted in Warrenville. Albright\u2019s notes indicate that reassembly of the setup and the construction of the space were not completed until the end of February 1950 (see fig. 69). According to Croydon, despite Albright\u2019s precise documentation of the original setup, the artist was forced to begin a new drawing, \u201cforfeit to the first buildup of oil paint\u201d; this second drawing allegedly took seventeen months. Given that the studio was newly finished, it is likely that the first underdrawing is the one featured in Marilyn Robb\u2019s Art News article published that summer (see fig. 70 and fig. 71).\n\nBy the time the work was photographed again, in 1954 (fig. 72), it was partially painted. Several compositional changes are visible on the right side of the picture: the angle of the window has been entirely changed so that almost no brick is visible between the window frame and the vertical grill member, the grill members themselves are portrayed more three-dimensionally and appear wider with respect to their surroundings, various shards of glass have been added on the ledge beneath the window, and at the far right a large branch obscures many of the bricks. Additional changes in this area, most notably the angle of the bird\u2019s nest near the right edge and the drape of the lace curtains and the amount of shutter they cover on the right side of the window, are visible when compared with a 1956 photo of the painting in an unfinished state, taken when the painting was exhibited at the Venice Biennale (fig. 17).\n\nThe 1956 image also helps decipher many compositional changes visible in the transmitted-infrared image of the final painting (fig. 73), especially on the left side of the window. The drape of the lace curtains has been altered along almost its entire length, eventually draping over the outside of the hand at the lower left. The chair leg once extended over the curtain near horizontal center, jutting slightly outside the window onto the frame. The position of the hand and some of the bracelets has been adjusted, as has the red-and-blue feather over the mirror near top center. The hair below the hand has been more carefully articulated in longer individual clumps and strands. On the right, inside the window, the small cherubs near the lower right have been removed.\n\nInterestingly, some of the early compositional changes between the 1950 and the 1954 and 1956 images are not readily visible in any of the technical images, most notably, the leaf on the windowsill at right (moved and crumpled in the final painting), the bricks at the far right (later obscured by the branch), and the placement of the bricks along the top of the window. Looking at the 1950 and 1956 images together, there appears to be less detail and shading in the 1956 version, especially noticeable in the hand, hair, and lace curtains and in the shading of the branches at far left. There is no evidence in microscopic examination that Albright added a white toning layer over his underdrawing to create a brighter base layer for his painting; in fact, some changes between the 1956 state and the final painting are still visible on the surface (see fig. 74). The lack of visibility of certain details from the 1950 state in both the technical images and the 1954 and 1956 images suggest that Albright\u2019s second drawing campaign took place on a new canvas.\n\nWhile on a break from Poor Room, Albright executed his only commissioned portrait, that of Mary Lasker Block. With a Parisian dress, her own jewels, a cigarette case with twenty diamonds, a rose, and a travel clock, Block sits in front of the back side of the set for Poor Room. As mentioned, Block sat regularly over the two years it took to paint the portrait. Transmitted-infrared imaging (fig. 75) revealed myriad changes to both the background and the figure. Both the lace and red curtains appear to have been completely reworked, possibly more than once, and the bricks may have once been visible at the far left, in addition to a patterned backdrop over the figure\u2019s right shoulder. The position of Block\u2019s shoulders, the length of her sleeves, and thickness and position of her right arm were all adjusted, as were the details of the chair. The area with the most changes, however, appears to be the lower right quadrant above Block\u2019s lap, where the transmitted-infrared image appears jumbled such that some of the changes remain obscured. Block\u2019s hands and gloves were moved, and more of the chair arm and table may have been visible. The elaborate cigarette case appears to be an addition over the stem of the rose, and the details of the clock and the wood grain in the table appear altered. Albright signed the work, considering it finished, in 1956; the original signature, in white, painted block letters, is still slightly visible in stereomicroscopic examination (see fig. 76 and fig. 77). It is unclear what prompted the reworking, or if the addition of certain features like the cigarette case is linked to the campaign of adjustments that motivated the redating.\n\nAlbright\u2019s only known posthumous portrait, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (fig. 28), was photographed in an unfinished state and featured in the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1963. Its caption helps confirm what is visible in the infrared image of the painting: \u201cThe face is almost completed, the rest of the figure sketched in. The background wall will be green, the captain\u2019s favorite color, and on the shelves against it will be his globe and some of his favorite books.\u201d In preparation for this portrait, Albright measured a bookcase and several of Patterson\u2019s books specifically, filling pages of his notebooks with individual measurements and a few scaled-down options for the background (see fig. 78). Although the only indications of the background in 1963 are the greenish color to the right of the figure\u2019s face and various slanted horizontal lines indicating the intended placement of the shelves, it is clear even under normal viewing conditions that many of the mentioned features were fully painted before Albright opted for the dark, relatively monochromatic background in the final painting. The infrared image of the work shows many of the books placed on two shelves across the background and the globe (see fig. 79); the placement of books along the lower shelf suggests that the couch from Patterson\u2019s sister in Wyoming was also a later addition. Interestingly, although much of the composition does not register in the X-ray, many of the features heightened with white drawing media in the 1963 image are visible, especially on the figure\u2019s body. The initial posture of the figure was shifted around the almost-complete, stationary head: his left shoulder was higher and less broad, coming down much closer to the body. Other features are only obvious in the 1963 image, including the placement and design of the tie, the tie pin that was later removed, and the item or chair arm on which the figure rests his hands.\n\nAlbright\u2019s propensity to change his compositions extended throughout his career. The latest of the works examined in this study, Pray for These Little Ones, shows a number of compositional changes in the painting stages of execution, as shown by the X-ray (fig. 80). In addition to adjustments in the various folds of lace, especially along the top and in the center of the composition, there are a number of more substantial changes. The composition itself comprises a number of seemingly random objects, including a pin cushion (see fig. 81), persimmons and kumquats, dried flowers and twigs, a worn brown doll\u2019s shoe (see fig. 82), a pink camellia flower with leaves, a small oval dish, and a red fabric swatch with needle and thread, all nestled in and around a rustic wooden platter framed with fine lace. A heavier, floral-patterned lace (see fig. 83) covers the bottom portion of the platter, intermingling with the real flowers in that area. Throughout the left side of the composition, there are the deconstructed remnants of two fans, their elaborate handles just below the pin cushion and various pieces of folded fan paper at the upper and lower left. At the upper left, the section of fan now almost entirely tucked behind the tomato-shaped pin cushion once protruded nearly to the corner of the painting; the broken fan handle further down the left side was rotated about 45 degrees closer to horizontal, exposing a different section of the wooden platter. In the lower left corner, there clearly have been several changes, but the exact forms are harder to discern. Here, some of Albright\u2019s preparatory working diagrams (see fig. 84 and fig. 85) help confirm what is visible in the X-ray: rather than the shriveled persimmon currently visible, the artist originally placed a kumquat with a defined after-color shadow. The shards of mirror were once larger, the twig was in a different position, and it appears the bottom corner of the wooden platter was visible, not yet covered by the crumpled fan paper present in the finished work.\n\nThe piecemeal nature of Albright\u2019s painting process is clearly visible in the unfinished works; however, there is evidence of the artist working in broader strokes. While Albright did not varnish his paintings, many of the works, when viewed in ultraviolet illumination, show some evidence of translucent layers and oil-rich glazes, although the artist repeatedly disdained this practice, arguing that it was \u201ca pretense to show more than is actually there.\u201d While in some cases the artist used translucent colors to add nuance to his sometimes dark, nebulous backgrounds, as in Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (see fig. 86) and The Temptation of Saint Anthony (see fig. 87), in many works he appears to have used oil-rich, often brownish toning layers over heavily patterned and detailed surfaces such as lace or bricks to create soft folds and broad shadows, as seen in Portrait of Mary Block (see fig. 88), Poor Room (see fig. 89), Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (see fig. 90), and Pray for These Little Ones (see fig. 91).\n\nAlbright\u2019s care for his materials and process extended past the completion of the paintings to the creation of the frames, which he made for himself as well as for his father and brother throughout his career. Of the studied paintings, The Lineman, Showcase Doll (fig. 92), Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, Self-Portrait (fig. 93), Picture of Dorian Gray, The Temptation of Saint Anthony (fig. 94), Poor Room (fig. 95), and Pray for These Little Ones (fig. 96) have artist-made frames, while Portrait of Mary Block (fig. 97), Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (fig. 98), and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d (fig. 99) appear to have traditional frames with artist-toned finishes and/or liners. Many of the frames, like the taurus-profile frame on The Lineman (fig. 100), show a heavy Arts and Crafts influence, with characteristic soft carving and individualistic decorative motifs.\n\nUsing a different take on singular embellishment, the frame on Picture of Dorian Gray (fig. 101) features a pair of lions on the top center cartouche and a carved scroll with the painting\u2019s title and artist\u2019s full name at the bottom. So as not to let the frame escape the evidence of decay so often seen in his paintings, Albright used punch tools here, as well as on the frames for Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida, The Door, and The Temptation of Saint Anthony, to add imitation wormholes to the front and exterior sides; upon close inspection, the artificial nature of these holes is clear, as some of them are square (see fig. 102).\n\nProbably the most elaborate of Albright\u2019s frames, the original frame for The Door is unfortunately lost. Executed in augmented perspective, with adjustments to the width to echo those in the painting, the frame reportedly included writhing figures in silver leaf and a casket fabric lining for which he had to obtain a permit from an undertaker. The heavily embellished frame apparently upstaged the painting, so that many of the initial reviewers spoke more about it than the work itself, forcing Albright to discard his original treatment for the more traditional frame in which it is still housed (see fig. 103). The current frame seems to be a repurposed frame onto which Albright cast the corner cartouches and inner and exterior moldings.\n\nWhile the writhing figures featured on the original frame for The Door are now lost, it is possible they looked similar to those featured on the elaborate frame for Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (see fig. 104). With a format based on the design of an eighteenth-century French Regency frame, Albright purposely curved the sides outward slightly to accentuate the sense of perspective. The carved wood frame features several small figures: an almost crawling figure on the top center cartouche (see fig. 105), with its pendent figure seen from the rear at center bottom (see fig. 106), while along the sides various figures cling to, drape on, and hang from the ornamental outcroppings (see fig. 107). Many of the decorative motifs appear to be taken from traditional French frames, however; Albright has repurposed, jumbled, and adjusted them to suit his needs. The crosshatch recut pattern, also known as quadrilage, is usually employed at a miniature scale to give textural nuance to a particular area but here has been greatly enlarged. The artist also uses the popular ribbon-and-reel motif often found post-eighteenth century along the inner molding, and combined it with the crosshatch recut pattern between cartouches. The traditionally symmetrical rosettes at the corners and lower center are purposely mismatched. Ida\u2019s frame shows there is a playfulness in some of Albright\u2019s frames that, if observed, can balance some of the more macabre subject matter in the paintings themselves. Unlike the original frame for The Door, however, the details of the frames may be overlooked for their contents.\n\nDespite the intense level of detail in Albright\u2019s works, the paint layers themselves are amazingly thin. With a structure often composed of an artist-primed canvas, using zinc white and glue, followed by an intense but inherently dry and powdery underdrawing layer, a spray fixative, and delicate paint layers, the pictures have tended to have specific and recurring condition issues throughout their lives. Perhaps in part due to the hygroscopic nature of the canvas and glue-based ground, or the overall thinness of the paint structure, many of the canvases are prone to buckling, despite repeated flattening and retensioning treatments. There does not appear to be enough material to hold the fabric supports in place over time. And in order for Albright to execute the fine detail for which he was known, he had to thin his paints using spirits or oil and spirits, at times to the point of creating underbound paint layers. Sometimes the paint appears to have been so thinned that the colors flowed into one another upon application (see fig. 108). Additionally, the dry nature of the mostly charcoal-based underdrawing creates a point of weakness within the overall structure with regard to adhesion. Between these factors, many of the works are prone to blanching, cracking, and flaking, resulting in the need for past treatments including lining, consolidation, and varnishing.\n\nHappily, Albright cultivated relationships that would ensure many of his works were destined for the museum environment (see the introduction by Sarah Kelly Oehler). In addition to his works, Albright gifted the Art Institute a selection of his studio props, preparatory working diagrams, scrapbooks of press clippings, and many of his notebooks, especially those concerning paintings in the museum\u2019s collection. Although the primary archives collection was donated by his widow posthumously, Albright had prepared the notebooks for this purpose, adding annotations and labels to the books to denote specific sections and pages pertaining to individual paintings, with their collection status and plate number in the Croydon monograph specified. Such foresight has allowed for the present study.\n\nIt is interesting to compare the methods of the current examination with Albright\u2019s own interests, especially with regard to the relatively new technology of his time, the X-ray, something that had fascinated him ever since his experience as a medical draftsman during World War I (see fig. 109). The artist said, \u201cI became fascinated with my chance to study the human body as if with a magic eye. I could, by studying closely the record on each [X-ray] plate, imagine that I saw every human body as though it were translucent.\u201d Viewing Albright\u2019s paintings with the same translucency brings to light the complicated planning and execution of his works, which, despite the thoughtful assembly of props and models; specifically designed studio space and furniture; working diagrams of spatial relationships, lighting, and canvas configurations; and specifically chosen and artist-made art materials, are full of evidence that Albright was not a slave to his models or his plans. Indeed, he continued to refine his compositions until and even after they were finished. It seems both ironic and fitting that Albright\u2019s \u201cmagic eye\u201d could be used to uncover the methods behind his seemingly magical technique.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">\u201cGrandeur in Decay,\u201d Time, 84, no. 26 (Dec. 18, 1964).\n\nKatharine Kuh, The Artist\u2019s Voice: Talks with Seventeen Artists (New York and Evanston: Harper and Row, 1960), 24\u201325.

This selection includes works well documented in contemporary literature, unfinished works, and those illustrating the artist\u2019s experimentation with materials. The Lineman (1927; cat. 3) is one of the earliest Albrights in the Art Institute\u2019s collection and, along with the well-documented Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (1929\u201330; cat. 7), illustrates the development of the artist\u2019s style. Three Love Birds (1930; cat. 8), Showcase Doll (1931/32; cat. 12), and Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d (1965/66; cat. 22) are all unfinished and confirm some contemporary accounts of his working methods. The 1935 Self-Portrait (cat. 14) provides a counterpoint to the discussion of Albright\u2019s only posthumous and commissioned portraits, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson (1962/64; cat. 21) and Portrait of Mary Block (1955/57; cat. 20), respectively. Picture of Dorian Gray (1943/44; cat. 18) and The Temptation of Saint Anthony (1944/45; cat. 19), both works related to major motion pictures, were painted over shorter periods, while That Which I Should Have Done, I Did Not Do (The Door) (1931/41; cat. 13) and Poor Room\u2014There Is No Time, No End, No Today, No Yesterday, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever, and Forever, and Forever without End (1942/43, 1948/55, 1957/63; cat. 17) each took more than ten years to complete. Picture of Dorian Gray and Poor Room were also well documented in the contemporary media, including images of the works in their unfinished states. The late Pray for These Little Ones (Perforce They Live Together) (1973/74; cat. 24) is a rare example of a work executed on a silk support. Examinations included X-ray, reflected-infrared, transmitted-infrared, ultraviolet imaging, and in-situ X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) analysis on all paintings. Cross-sectional analysis, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), and Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) analysis were conducted on selected paintings and samples.\n\nBasic biographical details, including the dates and locations of many of Albright\u2019s various studio spaces, are outlined in Robert Cozzolino, \u201cIvan Albright: A Chronology,\u201d in Courtney Graham Donnell, Susan S.

Study for \u201cThe Vermonter\u201d is artist-primed with a lead white\u2013based ground. The 1935 Self-Portrait and Picture of Dorian Gray are commercial preparations, with zinc-based and lead-and-zinc-based grounds, respectively. The hardboard used for Captain Joseph Medill Patterson\u2014primed front, back, and on the exterior edges\u2014has the only titanium-based ground observed; it was likely a commercially or industrially prepared support. The grounds were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), in some cases supplemented with scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). For more detailed results and conditions used, see analytical reports for the individual paintings, and Kimberley Muir, Maria Kokkori, and Francesca Casadio, Albright analysis results, June 2018, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe secondary support for this work suggests that the artist was unsure how to best work with the fragile textile: the silk is loosely draped around Foamcor and attached with masking tape. The support was confirmed to be a mixture of natural and manufactured silk with microscopic fiber analysis by Inge Fiedler, Feb. 21, 2018. According to Croydon, Albright traveled to the Far East and was inspired by Japanese art executed on silk sized with glue. The sample was not analyzed for the presence of glue sizing. See Croydon, Ivan Albright, 267.\n\nThe only tinted ground clearly observed was the gray one used for Showcase Doll. The Door appears to have a tinted second ground or gray imprimatura layer in stereomicroscopic examination; analysis of the only sampled cross section proved inconclusive. Further analysis would be needed to confirm the layer structure and composition. The presence of zinc white and bone black in Showcase Doll confirmed with SEM/EDX analysis. See Muir, Kokkori, and Casadio, Albright analysis result.\n\nRobb, \u201cIvan Le Lorraine Albright Paints a Picture,\u201d 46; The ground medium for Poor Room was not analyzed. The ground for Three Love Birds, an artist-applied ground, was identified as predominantly zinc white bound in glue, while the ground for the commercially prepared Self-Portrait was identified as predominantly zinc white in oil. See Francesca Casadio, reflected FTIR analysis summary results, June 14, 2018; and Muir, Kokkori, and Casadio, Albright analysis results, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is not clear whether Three Love Birds retains its original stretcher, as it was retensioned in an undocumented treatment and the current stretcher has no artist inscriptions. The stretchers for Picture of Dorian Gray and The Temptation of Saint Anthony were replaced in earlier conservation treatments with no documentation of their previous secondary supports.\n\nPretreatment documentation for Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida suggests its original stretcher was a four-member mitered stretcher (likely commercial) without crossbar or manufacturer\u2019s marks. The stretcher for The Lineman was reinforced with crossbars during the 1996 treatment. See Louis Pomeranz, inscriptions on verso of Ida pre-lining photograph, Aug. 1955; and Faye Wrubel, treatment report, The Lineman, May 7, 1996, in their respective conservation object files, Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA a pencil line denoting the straight edge appears just inside a rather crudely cut edge facing the verso of the painting.\n\nThese extra pieces seem to have been added as part of the original construction: the additional top and bottom pieces are incorporated into what appears to be the original arrangement of tacks along the tacking margins on the side and verso.\n\nCroydon, Ivan Albright, 175.\n\nGridding is a common practice used by artists to transfer a design from one medium to another, such as from a photograph to a drawing or from a drawing to painting. Rather than relay an entire composition at once, the artist can copy the contents of one square at a time, resulting in a more accurate transfer. With regard to the original source material for the Patterson portrait, Albright asserted that he had met his father-in-law only once before his death and based the portrait on photographs.

Artist Mitch O\u2019Connell visited Albright at his studio during the execution of The Vermonter and documented the event in his blog entry \u201cIvan Albright!,\u201d May 30, 2011.\n\nPoor Room was executed in three campaigns (1942/43, 1948/55, 1957/63), punctuated by the artist\u2019s work on other paintings, travel, and the construction of his Chicago studio. When the setup was dismantled to be moved from Warrenville to Ogden Avenue, despite the artist\u2019s preparation (numbering and labeling each of the bricks, among other things), the reconstruction was not close enough to the original. Although he had already spent a year on the drawing, Albright was forced to re-execute his underdrawing over another seventeen months. The Door: Croydon, Ivan Albright, 85.

In other works, where they may have been heavily covered by charcoal, such fine lines would be highly camouflaged if not invisible with current imaging methods.\n\nThanks to Harriet Stratis for her expertise on common drawing materials to help visually distinguish vine and fabricated charcoal and pastel among the various media on the unfinished works.\n\nBone black identified by SEM/EDX.

Nitrocellulose, according to Hiler, can also be used as a varnish, applied over shellac with an airbrush, or atomizer as was available at this time.

There are also red and white colored spots at regular intervals throughout the hands but not anywhere else in the work. Such spots typically correlated to similarly colored ones on Albright\u2019s setups and props, so it is unclear what they could refer to here. Many of these spots and grid intersections also appear to be pinholes, some with accompanying incised marks. Even if the artist had turned to a live model to execute the hands, the use of dots to mark his place would have been impractical; one wonders whether he had a color photograph or made a plaster cast. In the other works examined, the dots seem to be related to the nuanced articulation of textures and colors in the painting stages of execution. The two works that made use of plaster-cast hands, The Door and Poor Room, both show the use of colored placeholder dots, but neither have such markings on the hands themselves. At normal viewing distance, the spots on the hands in Captain Joseph Medill Patterson tend to blend with the surrounding knobby texture, but their function in the artist\u2019s process remains unclear.\n\n\u201cMore Than a Portrait,\u201d 56.\n\nAlbright, interview by Cummings, 60.\n\nThe specific oil of Albright\u2019s paints was not analyzed; further analysis would be necessary to confirm this assertion. Albright commented that he had used Blockx, as well as Winsor Newton paints, and \u201cknew about\u201d Shiva and Persley. See Albright, interview by Cummings, 60. According to Croydon, Albright used Blockx for both The Door and Poor Room; Croydon, Ivan Albright, 105.
