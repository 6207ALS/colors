    "transcript": "<p>Annelise Madsen: This is a painting called &quot;Street in Venice&quot; that Sargent did in 1882. So just a short time after he finished his professional training in Paris, he goes to Venice for two important occasions early in his career at this moment of transition between student and professional. And he creates a series of genre scenes, scenes of everyday life. I'm Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. A woman is striding down a street or an alley and Sargent is interested in capturing the way that she's moving down the street and you see Sargent's skill in showing the movement of her shawl and her skirt kind of kicking up as she walks forward. Well, Sargent's working in a pretty somber palette here, but he still gives us a sense of the sunlight that is filtering through and you have these kind of punches of high-keyed color. You see these emerald greens, these peaches, magenta, that give you kind of a taste of Sargent's use of a more bold palette. So this painting came to Chicago just a few years after Sargent painted it, in 1888, and it came to a trade fair called the Interstate Industrial Exposition that was launched in the 1870s, in 1873, just two years after the Great Fire of 1871. The city was devastated, but it rebuilt quickly and on the heels of this investment in rebuilding the city physically, there was also a new interest, a new investment in building the city's cultural profile.</p>\n",
