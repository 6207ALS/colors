    "description": "<p>Graphic designer James Goggin has spent over 10 years developing the performance project <em>Pop Culture Colour Theory</em>, a body of research on the immaterial yet evocative concept of color. This research includes examples from his own practice and teaching as well as iconic uses of color in the history of art and design by artist Yves Klien, architect James Stirling, and many others. Brought to life with a custom soundtrack and multi-screen projection, Goggin draws connections among a broad spectrum of serious and not-so-serious thinking on color, from research in the hard sciences to images drawn from pop culture and entertainment.</p><p>Artists Connect is a new series of in-gallery programs that highlight the creative process. Artists, poets, dancers, and musicians engage with works of art, making connections to their own practice and inspiring new ways of understanding the Art Institute\u2019s collection.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p><p> </p>",
