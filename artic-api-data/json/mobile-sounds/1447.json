    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  The elaborate carving of this thirteenth century Indian deity exemplifies sculpture of the Hoysala dynasty. Madhuvanti Ghose spoke in the galleries about the subject of this sculpture.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: The goddess Saraswati was popular and venerated by the Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, all of the old religions of India. In fact, Saraswati was a river which now has gone into the deserts of northwest India as a river under the earth, under the soil, rather than a river that is visible. The Vedas are full of references to this ancient river Saraswati. Possibly because of this reason, she is soon personified as a goddess. And she symbolizes learning and all of the arts. The prabhamandala or the back of the sculpture is exquisitely carved. You see this beautiful this vegetal motif which actually represents the water coming out of the mouth of two crocodiles or makara\u2019s which are on either side.<br>Narrator:  One crocodile is located by Saraswati\u2019s raised left hand which holds a noose.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: And then out of the mouth of these crocodiles come out this cruel like feature which is, in fact, representing the waters and the vegetation in the waters. And it\u2019s all then being consumed by this monster mask or Kirtimukha which you see just above the crown of the goddess Saraswati.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  This sculpture originated in a Jain temple.</p>\n",
