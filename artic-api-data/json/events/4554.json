    "description": "<p>This performance is the second of three live opening performances for Anne Imhof's exhibition, entitled <a href=\"/exhibitions/9226/anne-imhof\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sex</em></a><em>. </em>No registration is required, and viewing is on a first-come, first-served basis. The performance takes place from 12:30 to 4:00 p.m., but visitors can come and go from the gallery.</p><p>Anne Imhof (born 1978, Giessen, Germany) has emerged as one of the most provocative and pioneering voices of her generation. Her work gives form to a sense of alienation and detachment that increasingly shapes our society. In this performance, Imhof and her collaborators continuously shift between and explore binaries, including male and female, hope and desperation, pain and pleasure, and ultimately, life and death, dealing with these seemingly irreconcilable forces and merging what appears to be incompatible.</p><p><a href=\"/exhibitions/9226/anne-imhof\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the exhibition and performance</a></p><p>Additional performances:</p><p>Thursday, May 30, 3:30\u20137:00<br>Saturday, June 1, 12:30\u20134:00</p><p>This exhibition is the second of three chapters in a project commissioned by Tate Modern, London; the Art Institute of Chicago; and Castello di Rivoli Museo d\u2019Arte Contemporanea, Rivoli-Turin.</p><h3><strong>About the Performance</strong></h3><p>This performance was developed with Eliza Douglas and in collaboration with Billy Bultheel, Frances Chiaverini, Josh Johnson, Mickey Mahar, Enad Marouf, Stine Omar, and Lea Welsch.</p><p><strong>Cast:</strong> Billy Bultheel, Eliza Douglas, Sacha Eusebe, Josh Johnson, Enad Marouf, Stine Omar, Franziska Presche, Nomi Ruiz, and Kizito Sango<br><strong>Music:</strong> Billy Bultheel, Eliza Douglas, Anne Imhof, and Ville Haimala <br><strong>Composition and Vocals:</strong> Eliza Douglas<br><strong>Composition and Arrangements:</strong> Billy Bultheel<br><strong>Mixing and Production:</strong> Ville Haimala<br><strong>Lyrics:</strong> Eliza Douglas and Anne Imhof<br><strong>Special Guest:</strong> Nomi Ruiz<br><strong>Costumes: </strong>Eliza Douglas<br><strong>Dramaturgy and Choreographic Assistance: </strong>Enad Marouf<br><strong>Stage Management:</strong> Joie Iacono<br><strong>Exhibition Architecture: </strong>substance &amp; inhalt<br><strong>Photography:</strong> Nadine Fraczkowski<br><strong>Producers: </strong>Paola Ravagni,&nbsp;Laura Langer, and Jos\u00e9 Segebre<br><strong>Editor: </strong>Moritz Nebenf\u00fchr<br><strong>Assistants: </strong>Charlotte Kuhn, Viviana Abelson, Luis Einhauser,&nbsp;and Tom\u00e1s Nervi</p><p>Special thanks to Zo\u00eb Stupp.</p>",
