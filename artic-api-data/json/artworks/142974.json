    "description": "<p>Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person\u2014Julius Caesar\u2014appeared on coins. While the front side depicted the sovereign\u2019s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler\u2019s accomplishments or aspirations.</p>\n<p>On this coin, Octavian celebrates his triumph over the forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra in 31 BC; a defeat so thorough that both committed suicide rather than be humiliated as prisoners of Rome. With the inscription on this coin, Octavian announced boldly \u201cEgypt [is] captured.\u201d</p>\n",
