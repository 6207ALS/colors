    "description": "<p>Although he was famed as a painter, Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault feared that he could never rival the work of his predecessors. Thus, he embraced the invention of lithography in the late 18th century as an opportunity to become the master of a new medium. In lithography a grease crayon was used to draw on a smooth stone, a process more similar to painting and drawing than other forms of printmaking. The development of G\u00e9ricault\u2019s work mirrors the exploration of lithography\u2019s possibilities; here, for example, the artist experimented with the use of subtle contrast.</p>\n",
