    "transcript": "<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Robert Delaunay\u2019s \u201cRed Tower\u201d isn\u2019t a red tower at all. It\u2019s the Eiffel Tower in Paris and for many, many years, and I think even still today, it\u2019s a great icon of modernity. The Eiffel Tower was built in 1889 for the Paris World\u2019s Fair and it was the tallest building in the world until the 1930s-- until 1930.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Stephanie D'Alessandro, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern Art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Delaunay was an artist who was very inspired by Cubism, the idea of looking for geometric shapes in many ways to help describe things in the natural world in a more systematic and regular kind of way. But at the same time he was interested in fracturing forms and dissolving these kinds of solids. I think one thing that\u2019s amazing about this picture is the way that the Eiffel Tower seems to be busting through the surface of this picture. It\u2019s so powerful and dynamic and I think Delaunay in many ways accentuates that with these beautiful rays of light that are fractured and shining through the spaces of the tower. And look up on the right-hand side, how amazing it seems, almost like they\u2019re wings-- like the building is going to almost fly right out of this urban space. It\u2019s a wonderful celebration of modernity in so many ways.</p>\n",
