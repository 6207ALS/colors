She posed for several other, similar lithographs in late 1893, including The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) and Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73), as well as two that were only printed posthumously (cat. 71 and cat. 74).\n\nWhen he finally sent this image to the Ways for printing in July 1894 (letter 57), Whistler was apparently mindful of his agreements to provide both The Art Journal and The Studio with lithographs suitable for publication. Although he had already drawn Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81) for publication in The Art Journal, he seems to have flirted with several alternative choices in early July, including this lithograph (see also cat. 82). Whistler understood the problems surrounding the machine printing of large editions for periodicals, and he insisted that such editioning be done only from supplementary stones in order to protect the original matrix from wear. He also knew from experiments conducted by the Ways that drawings with stump work ran the risk of losing their subtle, nuanced tones in the retransferring process. For this reason, despite his enthusiasm for the delicate tonalities and atmospheric effects he could achieve with the stump, the first two drawings he produced in early July 1894 (cat. 82 and cat. 83) relied exclusively on line, as does Little Draped Figure, Leaning. Although none of these three lithographs were ever published, the artist\u2019s letters to the Ways and to D. C. Thomson, editor of The Art Journal, make it clear that his concern to produce images suitable for large editions was a determining factor in the techniques he selected for these drawings.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid Japanese vellum (317 \u00d7 225 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (316 \u00d7 221 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid Japanese vellum (340 \u00d7 244 mm); SC, cream laid Japanese vellum (316 \u00d7 226 mm), signed.
