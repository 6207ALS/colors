    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Edouard Vuillard based this tranquil scene on the view from a balcony in a village house near Paris where he often spent the summer.  Vuillard made the painting as a decoration for the dining room of a Paris art dealer.  He used distemper, a mixture of powdered pigments bound by hot glue and water.  The distemper's soft, chalky colors and a craggy paint surface are perfect for depicting a mass of foliage.  Vuillard's painting also draws in 16th century Flemish tapestries for inspiration in its grand scale and its arrangement of figures seen between the leaves.  The painting is dominated by a great, spreading oak tree.  Beneath it is a lush, jungle-like tangle of garden plants, a harmonious mixture of greens, blues and yellows.  As we look at the painting, figures emerge from the pattern of foliage, sunlight and shadows.  A little girl turns to her dog or cat, while a woman behind her seems about to open the garden gate.  In the sunlit lane beyond, we just glimpse the fruit seller of the painting's title, and a woman hurrying home with a baguette.  What more do you see in the painting?</p>\n",
