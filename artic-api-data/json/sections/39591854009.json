In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 52.1, fig. 52.2, and fig. 52.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa Suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see fig. 52.4 [Kornfeld 21]) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin (see cat. 52.1) and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. The analysis that follows of what the print depicts relies on a 1921 impression (cat. 52.2), which conveys all of the information that Gauguin inscribed and carved into the woodblock. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nWhile Noa noa, the title page to the suite, is traditionally called plate 1, Te po (The Night) can be considered the first image of the narrative sequence of the prints because of the inclusion here of Gauguin\u2019s monogram, PGo, within the sphere of glowing light at the print\u2019s upper left. This cartouche functions much like the initial letters in early European manuscripts and incunabula signaled the opening of sections and chapters. In Te po, we move from the depiction on the title page of daylight and the activity of food gathering in a fecund natural setting\u2014daily existence as Gauguin documented it in his sketchbooks\u2014to the mysteries and fears of nighttime, sleep, and dreams, a dimension that reflects the interior life and belief systems of Tahitians.\n\nTe po is full of ambiguities. The sky is dominated on the left by a spherical shape, which illuminates a line dividing the sky from a mountainous horizon; at the bottom is a stream in which a fish swims. Compounding the mystery of whether the setting is indoors or out-of-doors is the presence at the bottom right of a burning oil lamp, which could be used inside and out. The central figure, entirely covered except for the head, left shoulder, and extended upper right arm, seems to slumber. However, close examination of the face reveals that the eyes may be half-open, indicating the sleeper\u2019s awareness of presences hovering nearby.\n\nWhile the petaled orb in the upper left, which Gauguin fashioned as a cartouche, would seem to reference the moon, its form can be linked directly to an image conjured by Charles Morice in verses written for Noa Noa. The poem speaks of the sun as the \u201cfleur des isles\u201d (flower of the [Tahitian] islands) as well as the \u201csoleil de r\u00eave\u201d (sun of dream[s]). Morice asked whether the sun actually shines on real land and people, or whether they are the product of his dream (\u201cmon r\u00eave\u201d). His description of the sun as old and vanquished (\u201csoleil, veilli, vaincu\u201d) is perhaps echoed in the listlessness of the petals surrounding the cartouche in Te po. This blurring of forms further imbues the image with a sense of mystery\u2014it seems to ask, \u201cWhat is reality, what is dream?\u201d\n\nTo suggest the nocturnal universe where Tahitians believed creatures and forces invisible by day revealed themselves, Gauguin fed his imagination with native and non-native references. Because Christian missionaries had destroyed many indigenous objects related to and reflecting religious beliefs of the region, the artist often drew upon Asian and Euro-Christian traditions to help him invent what he could not find visual equivalents for in Tahiti. In the case of the sleeping figure in Te po, he looked to a fresco in the papal basilica of San Francesco in Assisi then thought to be by Giotto di Bondone and now attributed to an anonymous follower of the early Italian Renaissance master. A photograph of this composition was one of a group of miscellaneous materials\u2014photographs, reproductions, prints, and drawings either from or reflecting various cultures, past and present\u2014that the artist often referred to while in Polynesia and that he called his \u201csmall circle of comrades.\u201d The depth of Gauguin\u2019s engagement with this photograph is indicated by the fact that he would eventually paste it onto page 236 of his 1896\u201397 manuscript Diverses choses (Various Things) (fig. 52.5).\n\nAmong the frescoes (fig. 52.6 left) is a scene illustrating two apocryphal stories: the arrival of Saint Mary Magdalen at Marseilles and the miraculous recovery of the royal mother and her son abandoned on a desert island (fig. 52.6 center). The recumbent figure in Te po is based on the depiction in the second scene of the shrouded royal mother lying on a tiny rocky outcropping at the composition\u2019s left (fig. 52.6 right). Like the woman in the fresco, the central figure in Te po lies on what seems to be hard ground in a mountainous setting and close to water. At the far left, wavy lines indicate foamy waves breaking over the rock on which the figure rests.\n\nThe identity of the wood-block print\u2019s main protagonist as female is confirmed by the image that directly inspired it. It is further underscored by the figure\u2019s presence in a composition that recalls Gauguin\u2019s 1892 Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 52.7 [W 457]). In this painting, the artist showed his young mistress, Tehura, as he claimed to have found her one night, terrified by a spirit of death (tupapau) she believed to be lurking nearby, which he depicted as an old woman seen in profile behind the girl.\n\nAs indicated above, two sources of light in the print illuminate the dark\u2014at the lower center, a round glass oil lamp, its wick aflame, and at the upper left, the sphere whose rays resemble petals. The shroud that covers the recumbent figure seems to glow from within, while light picks out the edges of other forms in the shadows. Adding a sense of foreboding is the silhouette of a horned devil\u2019s head that the shadow cast by the lamp assumes.\n\nAt the lower left, hovering over the plate\u2019s title, Te po, is a fishlike form representing a tii, a spirit that, while belonging to a mystical realm, was considered inferior to the gods in the hierarchy of Polynesian deities. The creature resembles the bottom-dwelling monkfish. A rather large animal, it possesses a huge flat head, gaping mouth, and long tail (see fig. 52.8). Gauguin included a fish with a similar head, but upended and with jellyfish-like tendrils, at the left of a composition in his 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (fig. 52.9). He would repeat this scene, in a more summary way, in his manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 52.10).\n\nBehind the reclining female are three figures that may be there to watch over her. That at the far left represents Gauguin, recognizable by the shape of his head, his mustache, and the way he leans his head on one hand (apparently a typical pose for him, since he assumed it in a photograph and in a self-portrait; see fig. 52.11 and fig. 52.12 [W 415]). His presence in Te po suggests his role as a raconteur, tasked with relating Tahiti as fact and Tahiti as dream. This is underscored by the artist\u2019s decision to incorporate his monogram within the shining, petaled orb, as if to say that his role was to shed light on Tahitian customs and beliefs through his written account Noa Noa and the wood-block prints that were to accompany it. Gauguin used his mistress the way a ventriloquist employs a puppet, channeling Polynesian cosmology and related subjects through the lens of her image and stories, as well as that of Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 study of South Seas religious beliefs, which he read. The resulting representations are an amalgam of images and ideas that, in the end, are Gauguin\u2019s own.\n\nNext to Gauguin is a ghostly presence, or tupapau, a spirit of the dead, whose face is partly obscured by one hand and shadow and whose body is barely articulated. Its form recalls that of a Peruvian mummy in the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro, Paris, that Gauguin sketched several times (see fig. 52.13, fig. 52.14, and fig. 52.15).\n\nMost clearly delineated is the figure at the right, a malevolent spirit (varau\u2019ino) whose face and torso confront the viewer directly. Gauguin was fond of this motif; one finds it in a number of his paintings, in particular Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) and a graphite study for it (fig. 52.16 [W 458, Field 1977 29]), and fig. 52.17 [Pickvance 64]). The devil motif figures in two other paintings from the same year, Barbaric Tales (fig. 52.18 [W 459]) and Parau hanohano (Terrifying Words) (fig. 52.19 [W 460] ). Gauguin executed variations of the latter painting in a wood relief of 1891/93 (fig. 52.20 [Gray 134]), three cover or title-page designs from 1893 (fig. 52.21, fig. 52.22, and fig. 52.23), a zincograph of 1893/94 (fig. 52.24 [Kornfeld 24]), and a pen-and-ink sketch of 1894 (fig. 52.25; woodcut monograph stamp, bottom right [Kornfeld 28]). Later he would paste a cutout of the devil from the zincograph onto the inside front cover of his 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After) (fig. 52.26).\n\nThe recumbent-female motif features in studies from life found on page 68 of the 1891\u201393 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook) (fig. 52.27). Here a masculine-looking figure stands above her, much as Gauguin placed himself above the sleeping protagonist of Te po. A roughly contemporary watercolor (fig. 52.28) features a row of three reclining figures above another sleeping woman. The image of a female in repose first appeared in the right foreground of Gauguin\u2019s 1892 canvas Te fare hymenee (House of Song) (fig. 52.29 [W 477, Field 1977 22]), in which two figures sleep in the foreground while a large social gathering takes place in the background. The artist incorporated the motif as well into two other paintings from that year: in Moe moea (The Dream) (fig. 52.30), a supine woman wearing a pareu occupies the entire width of the composition; an oil lamp at the upper left illuminates her and a second figure sleeps in the middle ground; and in Reclining Figure in Candlelight, one finds a composition very close to that of Te po, except in reverse.\n\nOn page 60 of his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, Gauguin pasted a fragment of Te po (fig. 52.31) and on page 63 mounted a watercolor version of Te fare hymenee (fig. 52.32). This watercolor served as the model for a late wood-block print, Interior of a Tahitian Hut (fig. 52.33 [cat. 92.2]). Included in various contexts, most of these reclining women were not intended to embody the sense of mystery and disquiet that Gauguin achieved in Te po. Significantly, Gauguin returned to the subject in plate 10 of Noa Noa, Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60), in which a reclining nude lies with her back to the viewer, signaling perhaps how isolating the experience of fearing spirits of the dead can be.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The title of this plate, Te po, inscribed in large capital letters at the bottom left, is a noun (with article) meaning \u201cthe night,\u201d which particularly fits the obscurity of Gauguin\u2019s images. In addition, p\u014d designates an ontological realm beyond tangible realities. In Le mariage de Loti by Pierre Loti (pseudonym for Julien Viaud), published in 1879, the narrator is struck by the \u201cvast number of mystical words derived from the old Maori religion\u201d found in a dictionary of the Tahitian language and mentions the translation of p\u014d as \u201cnight, the ancient past, an unknown dark world, hell.\u201d P\u014d was opposed to ao, \u201cday,\u201d within a dualistic worldview summarized as follows by the anthropologist E. S. Craighill Handy in 1927:\n\n. . . the Polynesian dualism placed on the positive side nature superior, the sacred and divine, the psychic, superior power (mana), the male principle, light, life, occult knowledge, the east and day (ao), and the strong, right side of man; while on the negative side were included nature inferior, the common and unsacred, the physical, the passive, receptive female principle, darkness, destructive influences and death, ignorance, the west and night (po), and the left or weak side.\n\nThis title makes clear that this work (and by implication the Noa Noa Suite as a whole) is not a genre scene. It seeks to give visual form not only to \u201cthe delightful realities of the present,\u201d but also to \u201cthe myths of the past\u201d\u2014and maybe to show that these \u201cmyths\u201d are alive in the present. The nocturnal scene features a reclining female figure, covered with what seems to be a blanket, rather than clothing, and appearing to sleep. Peter Zegers identifies a stream with a fish at the bottom and observes that the setting is ambiguous (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works): the ascending line suggests the ridge of a mountain, therefore an outdoor scene, while the burning oil lamp can also be associated with an interior.\n\nThe luminous sphere in the upper-left corner is equally ambiguous. Given the nightly atmosphere, it should represent the moon, but the petal-like shapes surrounding it evoke depictions of the sun as well as the flower most closely associated with it, the sunflower. The fact that Gauguin chose to place his monogram within this sphere implies a special link, which can be conceptualized in several ways. Zegers interprets it as expressing the artist\u2019s self-appointed mission of shedding \u201clight on Tahitian customs and beliefs\u201d (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). The sunflower, presenting its blossom to the sun, was an emblem of painting as an art of imitation, used as such for example in a famous self-portrait by Anthony van Dyck (fig. 52.34). Gauguin had an additional reason for identifying with this plant: his descent on his mother\u2019s side from a Peruvian family and claim that this genealogy might include indigenous blood, together with the fact that the sunflower had reached Europe from the Americas via Peru and played a part in the pre-conquest cult of the sun. In 1888, planning a stay in Martinique, he had explained the attraction he felt for the Tropics to a friend: \u201cThe Inca, according to the legend, came directly from the sun and I shall return there.\u201d The flower also evoked for him the memory of Vincent van Gogh, whom he had depicted as \u201cthe painter of sunflowers\u201d (fig. 52.35 [W 296, W 2002, 326]). The connection was based on Van Gogh\u2019s own identification with the flower, which was adopted by the Dutch artist\u2019s admirers and led to his being represented as one (with martyr\u2019s aureole) on the catalogue cover of his 1892 posthumous exhibition in Amsterdam (fig. 52.36).\n\nAdditionally, the visual oxymoron of a dark sun calls to mind the artistic and literary reception of Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s print Melancholia I (fig. 52.37), whose comet falling within a rainbow (also in the upper-left corner) was consistently described and appropriated as a \u201cblack sun\u201d in the nineteenth century. Most famously, the French writer G\u00e9rard de Nerval placed himself under the sign of \u201cthe black sun of Melancholy\u201d in his poem \u201cEl desdichado\u201d (\u201cThe Miserable One\u201d) and used this motif for a comparison between Europe and the Tropics in his Voyage to the Orient (1851); although the world he discovered in Cairo struck him as \u201cthe perfect antithesis\u201d of the one he had fled, he wrote that he did not always feel happier there, because \u201cthe black sun of melancholy . . . sometimes also rises above the luminous plains of the Nile.\u201d\n\nWithin the body of work realized by Gauguin during his first stay in Tahiti, the main antecedent of Te po is the painting Te fare hymenee (House of Songs) (fig. 52.38 [W 477]), which depicts a traditional nightly social gathering in a communal long house, with two women sleeping in the foreground. The print focuses on one of these figures and introduces an ambiguity of scale, since the curved shapes situated behind her and upon which her head and right arm seem to rest resemble hills or mountains more than pillows, sleepers, or dogs. This can be partly accounted for by the artistic source that Gauguin employed for this figure, a fourteenth-century fresco in Assisi then believed to be by Giotto, of which he possessed a photograph (fig. 52.39). Because of the symbolic character of the scene and of the artist\u2019s use of hierarchical proportions, its female protagonist resembles a giant lying on a diminutive island. The suggested analogy between the woman, self-contained in her red garment, and the island surrounded by the sea may have appealed to Gauguin when he detached the sleeping Tahitian from those who are awake.\n\nIn Te po, the three figures sitting behind the reclining one are not other Tahitians gathered for a h\u012bmene\u2014a polyphonic chant named after religious hymns\u2014but otherworldly beings. The burning lamp may refer to ghosts (t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u) since, in his 1893 Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline), Gauguin wrote that Tahitians had \u201ca constant fear of them. At night a lamp is always burning.\u201d But its apotropaic efficacy appears doubtful, as it shares sinister features with the creatures it is meant to keep at bay. Peter Zegers observes rightly that the shadow it casts assumes the silhouette of a horned devil\u2019s head (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works) and the lamp itself, while probably inspired by the upper part of a glass oil lamp, resembles the spherical explosives with a fuse sticking out that the anarchist bombings had by then turned into Western symbols of terror. Even the way in which the flame interrupts the outline of the woman\u2019s garment suggests that her protective envelope is not impregnable and may introduce a sexual connotation.\n\nZegers identifies the three figures in the background as representing (from left to right) Gauguin himself, a t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u derived from a Peruvian mummy, and a v\u0101rua \u2018ino or \u201cevil spirit\u201d (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). Gauguin\u2019s presence, according to Zegers, \u201csuggests his role as a raconteur, tasked with relating Tahiti as fact and Tahiti as dream.\u201d This supports the argument for considering Te po as the second plate of the Noa Noa Suite, immediately following the title page (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). It may not be the only self-representation of the artist in the series, however, and the position with the head resting on one hand, while typical of Gauguin, is also a main attribute of the representations of melancholy, included in countless allegories and self-portraits from D\u00fcrer\u2019s Melancholia I to the late nineteenth century and beyond. Gauguin\u2019s uncanny characters also recall iconographically more easily identifiable triads such as the antique Moirai and Parcae, or the incestuous family of the Devil, Sin, and Death in Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost.\n\nStephen Eisenman opposed the \u201cphysicality and mortality\u201d of the reclining woman to the \u201cspirituality and eternality\u201d of the \u201cold and ghostly spirits at right.\u201d A comparison with the artist\u2019s 1892 painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 52.40 [W 457]), which also features a reclining young woman\u2014in this case naked\u2014confronted with a \u201cspirit of the dead,\u201d illuminates the nature of the relationship between these unlikely companions. As Gauguin explained, the title can mean either that the terrified woman thinks of (or believes in) the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u, or that the spirit thinks of her or watches over her (see cat. 60). \u201cWatching over\u201d is an apt description of the passive but vigilant attitude of the spiritual trio in Te po, and the ontological reversibility established by the title Manao tupapau may also apply to the wood-block print: the spirits, even though immaterial, are no less \u201creal\u201d than the living human being. This also can be said of the fish, which hovers at the limit of recognizability and is hardly more substantial than the shadow-devil preceding its progression to the right\u2014especially in Gauguin\u2019s hand-colored impression of the print (cat. 52.1), which greatly accentuates the ghostly character of the whole scene. According to Zegers (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), this fish could represent a ti\u2019i, one of the \u201cspirits inferior to gods\u201d listed by J.-A. Moerenhout and which served as an \u201cintermediary and demarcation line between organic and inorganic beings\u201d (see cat. 54, Commentary).\n\nOne way of understanding the relationship between the reclining woman and the supernatural beings surrounding her is to think of them as elements of her dream. As early as 1881, Gauguin had demonstrated his interest in dreams and his ambition to include oneiric images in his paintings with The Little One Is Dreaming (fig. 52.41), a depiction of his daughter Aline asleep under pseudo-wallpaper that suggests the movements of her imagination. For French oneirologists such as Alfred Maury, whose research was widely disseminated, the dream represented a psychic regression to earlier stages of development, both of the individual and of the species. These conceptions, on which Sigmund Freud built his notion of the conservation of archaic modes of thought in the subconscious, are compatible with the understanding of p\u014d as \u201cancient times,\u201d preceding the colonization and Christianization of Polynesia, or even as \u201cthe primeval darkness that . . . existed before the earth was created.\u201d The \u201cevil spirits\u201d are, to some extent, the ancient gods supplanted by Jehovah who return under cover of the night. Robert Louis Stevenson concluded from his 1888 voyage over the Pacific:\n\n. . . in the whole field of the South Seas . . . all men believe in ghosts, all men combine with their recent Christianity fear and a lingering faith in the old island deities. So, in Europe, the gods of Olympus slowly dwindled into village bogies; so to-day, the theological Highlander sneaks from under the eye of the Free Church divine to lay an offering by a sacred well.\n\nGauguin would have agreed with the Scottish author\u2019s comparison of Polynesian beliefs with European \u201csuperstitions.\u201d In 1888 he had painted in Brittany Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Struggling with the Angel) ([W 245, W 2002 308] (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). It may seem strange that he included his own image among the \u201cspirits\u201d in Te po, but this is consistent with the incorporation of his monogram into the \u201cblack sun\u201d and with the fact that, in the 1901 version of Noa Noa, the narrator telling the anecdote behind Manao tupapau wonders whether his Tahitian mistress, whom he finds in the dark on his return from Papeete, does not take him \u201cfor one of the demons and specters . . . with whom the legends of her race fill the sleepless nights.\u201d Like Francisco Goya, who depicted himself assailed by \u201cmonsters\u201d engendered by \u201cthe sleep of reason\u201d (fig. 52.42), Gauguin saw as part of his task the evocation of the nocturnal side of experience, whatever the latitude.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . . An entrance space led to the studio. . . . This rather vast room, painted entirely in bright chrome yellow\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014created an immediate impression of strangeness and unpredictability. On the walls, smeared with barbaric canvases.)\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), pp. 123\u201324. Colta Ives identified the man at the lower-left corner of the photograph as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle, Paris. Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten wood-block prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the wood-block prints do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), p. 92.\n\nBetween 1893 and 1895, Gauguin worked closely with Morice on his planned publication of Noa Noa. Based on discussions with the artist, the stories he related, and his Tahitian paintings, Morice wrote poems for the publication that Gauguin copied onto page 52 into his manuscript. The third stanza of the poem \u201cLa Vivo\u201d reads: \u201cO drapeau de soleil que l\u2019oc\u00e9an d\u00e9ploie / Triomphal dans les ciels splendides de midi / Fleur des \u00celes, es-tu le R\u00e9el Paradis? / O vaste fleur de faste! O fleur de jeune joie!\u201d (This sunlit streamer that the ocean unfolds, / Triumphs over the magnificent noon skies. / Flower of the Islands, are you a Real Paradise? / Vast bloom of light! The bloom of youth\u2019s delight!). Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, 1893\u20131901, p. 52. Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, given by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, 1927, RF 7259. A second poem, \u201cLa vivo\u2014le soir,\u201d is closely related to Te po, as the following lines demonstrate: \u201cLe vent de l\u2019\u00e9ternel \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u2019endort dans l\u2019air Vesp\u00e9ral / Le soleil, vieilli, vaincu, r\u00e9cule / Devant la jeune lune au bord du cr\u00e9puscule / Se dressant, radieuse, et leurs feux, un moment / Sur la cr\u00eate des flots qui dansent, mollement. S\u2019entrebaisent\u2014et sur la t\u00eate solitaire / De l\u2019Arorai, temple et sommet de la terre / D\u2019ou le Rideau est bois d\u00e9robe \u00e0 tous les yeux / La gloire, la douleur et le s\u00e9cret des Dieux\u201d). Gauguin did not include this poem in his manuscript. Rather, it appeared in the version of Noa Noa that Morice prepared without Gauguin\u2019s involvement (much to his dismay) and published in La Plume 289 (May 1, 1901), pp. 64\u201365. Whether or not Gauguin knew this poem at the time he and Morice worked together on Noa Noa, it clearly reflects ideas and images they had shared.\n\nGauguin wrote to the artist Odilon Redon before his departure for Tahiti, \u201cGauguin is finished here; he will be seen no more. You see that I am an egotist. I am taking along photographs, drawings, a small circle of comrades who will speak to me about you every day\u201d (\u201cGauguin est fini ici, on ne verra plus rien de lui. Vous voyez que je suis \u00e9goiste. J\u2019emporte en photographies, dessins, tout un petit monde de camarades que me vous causeront tous les jours\u201d). Lettres de Gauguin, Gide, Huysmans, Jammes, Mallarm\u00e9, Verhaeren . . . \u00e0 Odilon Redon, ed. Roseline Bacou and Ar\u00ef Redon (J. Corti, 1960), p. 193.\n\nThe full story is as follows: the governor of Marseilles and his pregnant wife embark on a pilgrimage at the behest of Mary Magdalen, traveling by sea to Rome. After his wife dies in childbirth, the distraught governor docks his ship alongside an island in order to bury her. The ground is hard, forcing him to place her body on a cloth and put their still-living child at her breast. In Rome the bereaved pilgrim meets Saint Peter and spends two years traveling to sacred sites. Finally, on his journey home, he returns to the island, where he finds his son alive (having been miraculously nursed by his still-dead mother); the governor prays to the Magdalen and witnesses his wife restored to life. The apocryphal story was one of many recorded beginning in the mid-thirteenth century by Jacobus de Voragine and published in his The Golden Legend, Readings on the Saints. See William Granger Ryan\u2019s translation (Princeton University Press, 1993), pp. 374\u201383.\n\nGauguin turned to the writing of Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout in matters related to the Tahitian pantheon of gods. Moerenhout observed, \u201cThe Tiis would have some similarities with our devils or demons\u201d (\u201cLes Tiis aurient en ceci, quelques rapports avec nos diables ou demons\u201d). Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, p. 461.\n\nJacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, p. 461.\n\nNot having sold at the Durand-Ruel exhibition, this 1892 canvas was in Gauguin\u2019s studio while he was engaged in his Noa Noa project. The study belonged to a portfolio containing miscellaneous drawings, now dispersed, which Gauguin entitled \u201cDocuments Tahiti 1891 1892 1893.\u201d See Exposition Gauguin. Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, preface by Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (Galerie Marcel Guiot, 1942), no. 81, pp. 38, 41 (ill.).\n\nParau hanohano was included in Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Paul Gauguin (Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893), no. 11 (as Faire peur [To Frighten]), but it did not sell.\n\nThe texts incorporated into these cover and/or title-page images are difficult to read because the ink has faded. The first (fig. 52.21) is inscribed and dated within the composition Catalogue / [Tah]iti 93; the second (fig. 52.22) is inscribed within the composition Parau Parau no / Gauguin; the third (fig. 52.23) is inscribed, dated, and signed within the composition O Tahiti / An 92\u201393 / Paul Gauguin.\n\nThe artist passed over this work when making selections for his November 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel.\n\nBased on study of color reproductions, the attribution to Gauguin of both Moe moea and Reclining Figure in Candlelight seems questionable.

On this point, see Dario Gamboni, Paul Gauguin: The Mysterious Centre of Thought, trans. Chris Miller (Reaktion, 2014), pp. 356\u201358. However, the downward direction may also be interpreted as a movement toward the earth and the scene below, as in depictions of the ancient Egyptian sun god. For a discussion of the sunflowers and their association with Gauguin\u2019s Peruvian ancestry, see Douglas W.

See also Nicholas Wadley, ed., Noa Noa: Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti, trans. Jonathan Griffin (Phaidon, 1985), pp. 28\u201332.\n\nOne can only speculate about Gauguin\u2019s knowledge of the story depicted, a miracle performed by Mary Magdalen and related in Jacobus de Voragine\u2019s Golden Legend (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, n. 6), and on its relevance for Te po.\n\nAs early as July 1892, when Gauguin had been in Tahiti for less than a month, he wrote to his wife that he had attended h\u012bmene and enthused about their musical harmony.
