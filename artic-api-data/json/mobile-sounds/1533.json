    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Without a little background, it might be hard to understand the scandal this casual-looking restaurant scene caused when it was first exhibited. So let's have a closer look.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The man in the painting was James B. Moore, a lawyer who enjoyed the company of artists and writers. The fashionable woman beside him has been identified as the wife of restaurant owner Olly Mouquin. Is she turning away from the man in boredom? Or has something outside the picture caught the eye of them both? The artist, William Glackens, deliberately left their relationship ambiguous. In addition, the public objected to the casual proximity of the patrons in the restaurant, and to the undisguised display of alcohol on an otherwise almost empty table. A critic in the Chicago Post commented with disapproval, &quot;The man does not look like a prohibitionist.&quot; Glackens' painting was called sensationalist and vulgar. But with its loose and rapidly rendered brushwork, asymmetrical composition and vivid colors, it places us in the thick of a lively evening among New York's bohemians.</p>\n",
