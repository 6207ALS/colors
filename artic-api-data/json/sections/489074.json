Ryerson, 1922.4427a\u2013c\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">These curved marble fragments, which are adorned with figural relief decoration, once formed part of the rim of a much larger circular table, measuring at least 80 cm (31 1/2 in.) in diameter. The three fragments were previously accompanied by a now-missing fourth fragment, the appearance of which is attested in a photo published in 1923 (fig. 21.1). All of the fragments are bordered on the outer edge with an astragal adorned with an ovoid-beaded border, a variation on the much more commonly employed bead-and-reel motif. On the inner edge is a plain, raised band, adjacent to which are traces of the flat, polished table surface enclosed within the decorative rim.\n\nIn terms of their subject matter, all three fragments incorporate scenes of animal combat. The leftmost fragment (a) includes traces of three figures (fig. 21.2): on the far left is the posterior end of a stag, to the right of which is a ram with its head bent to the ground, perhaps in anticipation of an impending fight. At the far right is a now-headless animal with a body type and hooves comparable to those of the ram, thus suggesting that it is also a ruminant. The center fragment (fragment b) appears to have previously been connected with fragment c on the far right, based on their similar iconography as well as the matching diagonal break between the two fragments (fig. 21.3). At the center of fragment b is a small, wispy tree that separates the animals into two different scenes. On the left is a large bull, which lowers its head in preparation to charge, while on the right is a slender animal, perhaps a dog, which nips at the heels of the adjacent figure in fragment c, where the scene continues (fig. 21.4). Here there is a second dog on the far right, which assists in the attack on the boar at the left. The boar is identified based on the mane of bristly fur running down the center of the back of the head, its large snout with prominent teeth, and hoofed feet. The now-missing fourth fragment appears to have included another delicate tree at its center (see fig. 21.1), to the left of which stood a charging bull resembling that in fragment b. To the right of the tree was a ram, which sat calmly with its forelegs folded beneath it.\n\nThese fragments probably came from the same table as four similar fragments in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in Paris, three of which incorporate comparable scenes of animal combat. A reconstruction drawing published in Catherine Metzger\u2019s study of the table rim fragments in Paris and Chicago sheds light on the possible appearance of the circular table and the distribution of motifs throughout the rim (fig. 21.5). All four fragments in Paris (identified as fragments A, B, C, and D) include the same form of astragal on the outer edge with an ovoid-beaded border (fig. 21.6). Further, fragment a in Chicago, with its leftmost side depicting the posterior end of a stag, was determined to join with fragment D in Paris, which represents two stags locking horns in battle. In contrast to the scenes of combat, the fourth fragment in Paris incorporates a pastoral scene of a shepherd sitting on a rock. The selection of this motif, along with that of the seated ram in the now-missing Chicago fragment, indicates that the subject matter of the rim was not limited to images of battling animals and perhaps included bucolic punctuations on the scenes of animalistic aggression.\n\nRelief fragments comparable to the aforementioned examples have been found in diverse parts of the empire, including modern-day Italy, Algeria, Tunisia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus. Although there is considerable scholarly debate regarding the precise period when the tables from which they come were created, the extant fragments are most commonly dated to late antiquity, based not only on formal and stylistic considerations but also on the use of both secular and Christian religious iconography. Secular subjects include the hunt, animal combats, marine and pastoral scenes, and mythological imagery such as scenes from the life of Achilles. Christian religious subjects, which are thought to have been adopted at a later date, frequently feature scenes reflecting the themes of salvation or divine intervention on behalf of individuals in danger.\n\nThis iconographic variety has led to questions about the functions of the tables to which these reliefs once belonged, which were either circular or sigma shaped. While numerous sepulchral and liturgical functions have been proposed for the marble slabs with Christian iconography, those with secular imagery (as in this case) are generally thought to have been employed in dining contexts in elite Roman residences. Scenes of the hunt and animal combat were popular in such settings, as they conveyed messages of an elite, cultivated lifestyle that was characterized by the possession of considerable land, livestock, and leisure time for hunting, a mark of well-being and heroic courage. In an elite residence the table would likely have been set within a semicircular couch, also known as a stibadium, which would have accommodated a relatively intimate group of up to seven to nine guests. This arrangement is illustrated in a painting from the Tomb of the Banquet in ancient Tomis (Constan\u021ba) in Romania, which depicts five male banqueters reclining on a stibadium, at the center of which is a large, round table, perhaps of the type under discussion (fig. 21.7). This combination of dining furniture encouraged the type of small gathering that had long been favored in the triclinia of the late republican and early to mid-imperial periods, albeit in a form updated for the late Roman audience.  \nKatharine A.

By 1975 the whereabouts of the fourth fragment were unknown, as discovered following correspondence in 1975\u201376 with Catherine Metzger, conservator at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, who published a study in 1977 of the Louvre\u2019s table rim fragments that also featured a discussion of the Chicago fragments; see Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d pp. 53\u201356, esp. pp. 54 n. 2, 56, on the missing fourth fragment. See also the correspondence with Metzger (June 27, 1975\u2013Feb. 8, 1978) in the object\u2019s curatorial file, Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOn the popularity of the bead-and-reel motif in comparable marble fragments, see Kitzinger, \u201cMarble Relief of the Theodosian Period,\u201d p. 24.\n\nBoth M.C. and Metzger identified the figure on the left as a ram and that on the right more generally as a sheep; see Art Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 38; Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 55.\n\nOn the identification of this figure as a dog, see Art Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 38; Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 56. One might also consider the possibility that the sinuous curve of the tail, when combined with what appears to be a tuft of fur at its tip, might instead suggest a feline, specifically a lioness. On the other hand, it is possible that what appears to be the tufted tail might instead be a leaf or branch on the small, schematically rendered tree.\n\nBoth M.C. and Metzger suggested that it is not possible to identify the animal in fragment c that is recognized here as a boar; see Art Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 38; Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 56. However, this identification is apparent upon close examination.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 38.\n\nReconstruction drawing of the circular table, incorporating Louvre, Ma 3421, and Chicago, 1922.4427a\u2013c, in Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 55.\n\nOn Four Fragments of a Table Rim: Animal Combats and a Pastoral Scene (Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, Ma 3421), see Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d pp. 53\u201356; Metzger, \u201cQuatre fragments de rebord de table.\u201d The potential connection between the sets of fragments in Paris and Chicago was noted shortly after the acquisition of the latter by the Art Institute in 1922; see Art Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 39; Michon, \u201cRebord de plat chre\u0301tien,\u201d p. 174. However, it was not fully investigated for more than fifty years, when it was published by Metzger in 1977; see Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d pp. 53\u201356. On the Louvre reliefs, see also Michon, Rebords de bassins chr\u00e9tiens, pp. 31\u201333, cat. 8, pl. 1.2.\n\nThe connection between Chicago\u2019s fragment a and the related fragment in Paris with stags battling (fragment D) was verified in part through the production of a plaster cast of the Paris fragment, which was found to join with the Chicago one. See the curatorial file, Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMetzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 53 (identified as fragment A).\n\nThe Chicago table rim fragments were said to have come originally from Mesopotamia, an attribution that is no longer thought to be valid; see Art Institute of Chicago (M.C.), \u201cRim of a Byzantine Basin,\u201d p. 38. The associated fragments in Paris are said to have been found in Athens; see Michon, Rebords de bassins chr\u00e9tiens, pp. 31\u201333, cat. 8, pl. 1.2. On the possibility that all of the fragments can be attributed to the same Greek workshop, see Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d p. 56. On the diverse findspots of the known marble fragments of such tables, see Michon, Rebords de bassins chr\u00e9tiens, pp. 7\u201375; Kitzinger, \u201cMarble Relief of the Theodosian Period,\u201d p. 22 n. 9; Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs,\u201d pp. 49 (specifically on the findspots of the various fragments in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre), 56.\n\nNotable studies of such marble fragments include the group of similarly titled publications: Michon, \u201cRebords de tables byzantins en marbre\u201d; Michon, \u201cRebords de bassins chre\u0301tiens orne\u0301s de reliefs\u201d (1915); Michon, Rebords de bassins chre\u0301tiens; Michon, \u201cRebords de bassins chre\u0301tiens orne\u0301s de reliefs\u201d (1916); Michon, \u201cRebord de plat chre\u0301tien.\u201d See also Chalkia, Le mense paleocristiane; Cicikova, \u201cMensa sacra\u201d; Giveon, \u201cAlexandrine Decorated Basin Rims\u201d; Kitzinger, \u201cMarble Relief of the Theodosian Period\u201d; Metzger, \u201cRebords de tables orn\u00e9s de reliefs\u201d; Nussbaum, \u201cZum Problem der runden und sigmaf\u00f6ringen Altarplattern\u201d; Roux, \u201cTables chr\u00e9tiennes en marbre\u201d; Roux and Marcad\u00e9, \u201cTables et plateaux chr\u00e9tiens en marbre\u201d; Snyder, \u201cSo-Called Puteal in the Capitoline Museum at Rome\u201d; Thomas, \u201cBruchst\u00fcck einer fr\u00fchchristlichen Marmortischplatte.\u201d\n\nFor an overview of the various dates that have been assigned to similar fragments, see Kitzinger, \u201cMarble Relief of the Theodosian Period,\u201d p. 32 n. 59.\n\nOn secular subjects, see Kitzinger, \u201cMarble Relief of the Theodosian Period,\u201d p. 23.

Generally, see also Michon, Rebords de bassins chre\u0301tiens.\n\nIt has also been suggested that these types of relief fragments belonged to shallow basins.
