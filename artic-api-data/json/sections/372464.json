Whistler probably made the drawing in January 1896, when he also drew his only other lithographic portrait of a child, Little Evelyn (cat. 146). These two images seem to have prompted Whistler\u2019s friend Marcus Huish of the Fine Art Society to draft a notice announcing that Whistler would accept commissions for portrait lithographs. The advertisement, which Huish sent to the artist for his approval on March 9, mentioned children\u2019s portraits in particular. The announcement was doubtless intended to stimulate commissions at a time when Whistler\u2019s financial resources were taxed to the limit as a result of his wife\u2019s illness. Although the artist had alluded to such a scheme himself in January, when the drawings were made, by March he decided against advertising in the manner suggested by Huish, and he made no further portraits of children in lithography. He explained to Huish that \u201cthe time has rather gone by\u2014I have taken a studio\u2014and shall I fancy be at other work directly.\u201d\n\nWhistler made many additions to the stone after the original drawing was transferred. No proofs have been located to indicate what the image looked like prior to these changes. Despite the artist\u2019s efforts to revise the portrait, Little Dorothy was printed in only a few impressions; most of these were pulled on proofing paper and left unsigned. It is possible that the girl\u2019s parents were dissatisfied with the likeness and failed to order more than one or two impressions. Nevertheless, Whistler thought enough of the image to have the stone preserved by the Ways, and Rosalind Birnie Philip commissioned a large posthumous edition of the subject in 1903.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove paper (307 \u00d7 211 mm), signed; MWC, ivory wove proofing paper (286 \u00d7 223 mm).
