This liber amicorum (friendship album) contains 22 drawings and texts from artists and writers who visited the Grays between about 1970 and 2008.</p>\n<p>The gallery represented several of the artists, including David Hockney and Claus Oldenburg, while others, like Ellsworth Kelly, were simply visitors. A few of the drawings were made by authors in the Grays\u2019 orbit, among them Susan Sontag and Tom Wolfe. Other artists who contributed drawings to the Guest Book include Magdalena Abakanowicz, Jim Dine, Roy Lichtenstein, Louise Nevelson, and Saul Steinberg.</p>\n",
