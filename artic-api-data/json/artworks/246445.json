    "description": "<p>London-based artist Rosalind Nashashibi\u2019s meditative films merge everyday observations with a sensuous and at times fantastical cinematographic vocabulary. Commissioned for the quinquennial exhibition documenta 14 (Athens/Kassel, 2017), Nashashibi\u2019s tender and dreamy film Vivian\u2019s Garden depicts the relationship between \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists Elisabeth Wild (born 1922, Vienna) and Vivian Suter (born 1949, Buenos Aires)\u2014mother and<br>daughter\u2014in their adjoining houses located in Panajachel, a remote town in the rainforest outside Guatemala City. Wild and Suter have a fluid relationship, seamlessly trading roles of mother and daughter. Also present are villagers from a nearby indigenous community, who work in their homes as caretakers and housekeepers. The environment they share offers both terror and refuge from catastrophic weather, harassment, and crime. The<br>filmic portrait, which is presented adjacent to the exhibition of Suter\u2019s el bosque interior in the museum\u2019s Kenneth and Anne Griffin Court, focuses on the artistic, emotional, and economic lives of the household, offering a delicate look at the complex postcolonial relations within Suter and Wild\u2019s domestic space. In the fractured moments, incomplete conversations, and intimate interiors that constitute Nashashibi\u2019s approach to filmmaking, Vivian\u2019s Garden presents a mesmerizing view into lives filled with moments of abstraction<br>and lush beauty.</p>\n",
