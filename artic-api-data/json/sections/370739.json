In their 1908 biography of the artist, the Pennells recalled how the artist had drawn their portraits during afternoon visits to their lodgings on Buckingham Street. Firelight was singled out: \u201cWhistler made four portraits of J. [cat. 141, cat. 142, cat. 143, and cat. 144] and one of E., each the work of an afternoon. He worked on into the darkness, especially in the portrait of E., done while the firelight flickered on her face and on his paper.\u201d Always fascinated by the effects of firelight, Whistler had devoted several recent lithographs to the depiction of a Lyme Regis blacksmith shop illuminated by furnace light (cat. 125, cat. 127, and cat. 128). In his portraits of the Pennells, as in the smithy images of October 1895, he utilized networks of parallel lines to build the dramatic, flickering shadows surrounding his sitters.\n\nWhistler wrote an apologetic dedication on the impression of Firelight that he gave to the Pennells (now in the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Pennell Collection). Nevertheless, he must have been satisfied with the image, for it was one of five lithographs that he added to the Fine Art Society\u2019s exhibition in late January 1896, when the retrospective had already been underway for over a month.\n\nThere was no posthumous edition of this lithograph. Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s personal animosity toward the Pennells prompted her to order Goulding to erase this stone (see also cat. 143, cat. 144, and cat. 145).\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (332 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 226 mm), signed; SC, cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 220 mm).
