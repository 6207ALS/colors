    "description": "<p>For over fifty years, Ray Metzker has made innovations in photographic form with a meticulous graphic sensibility. A student of Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design, Metzker had his first one-man show at the Art Institute in 1959, which exhibited his master\u2019s thesis, \u201cMy Camera and I in the Loop.\u201d In the mid-1960s, he became frustrated with the limitations of the single image, and began his Composites as a way to explore, as he wrote, \u201ccomplexity of succession and simultaneity, of collected and related moments.\u201d Influenced in part by Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s gridded motion studies, he printed multiple images in careful graphic sequences. In <em>Composites: Philadelphia</em>, Metzker employed an entire roll of film, rewinding and reshooting (and thus double-exposing) the backlit nude silhouette to produce a work that relates images to one another across time.</p>\n",
