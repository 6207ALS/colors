    "description": "<p>You Are Beautiful began in 2002 as a sticker that spreads a hopeful message through public art. Their goal? To be a positive force and transmit a simple idea: Everyone deserves to feel good with who they are. Soon they were shipping little stickers around the globe, in over one hundred languages. Since then, the project has actively combatted negativity by distributing millions of stickers and grown into large-scale, metal and wood installations, murals, as well as collaborations with many designers, students, and artists, worldwide. The&nbsp;community-based message always includes your voice, &amp; they invite you to keep sharing hope with your world.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p>It's true, this message is magnetic. Slap up the message with this 10 pack of magnets!<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Have fun tossing, slapping, and placing these thin magnets on most any metal surface! Printed in USA &amp; China and packaged with love in Chicago.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2 x 1.5 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Flexible foil</li></ul>",
