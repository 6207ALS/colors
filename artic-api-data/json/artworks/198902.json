    "description": "<p>This elegant cup was made in England in 1590. Its elaborate silver-gilt cover and stem enhance the surface of an unexpected material: an ostrich egg. Ostriches and their eggs were very rare in Europe at the time, and not much has changed\u2014when the cup was sold to the Art Institute, it had to go before the British export review board to obtain a separate license for the egg itself, because ostriches are now an endangered species.</p>\n<p>Eighty years after the cup was made by John Spilman, Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraeten painted it for the grandson of John Whitfield, the original owner of the cup. The painting prominently features the cup, along with other objects that were being recorded for posterity. In much the same way as we might videotape items in our home to make a record for an insurance company, the painting records the cup\u2019s existence, as does the will of Whitfield\u2019s grandson (also named John Whitfield), which details the items in the painting: \u201ca large medal of the King of Sweden, his mother\u2019s locket of diamonds in three parts, his grandfather\u2019s sealed ring, his stricking [sic] watch, the Estrich [sic] cup, and Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Glass, which was his grandfather\u2019s.</p>\n",
