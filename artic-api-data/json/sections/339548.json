In 1877 he married Helen (Nellie) Ionides, a member of the Anglo-Greek shipping family whose father and brothers were among James Whistler\u2019s early patrons. Dr. Whistler established a practice in Wimpole Street and became a highly respected surgeon, eventually helping to found the London Throat Hospital.\n\nThe two brothers appear to have been very close, and, according to T. R. Way, the artist had a \u201cchildlike faith in his brother\u2019s skill as a physician.\u201d When Beatrix Whistler became ill in the late summer of 1894, Dr. Whistler traveled to Paris to examine her and to confer with her physicians. He diagnosed her condition as cancer, advised against surgery in Paris, and recommended that she come to London for treatment. Whistler was at first unable to accept his brother\u2019s prognosis of Beatrix\u2019s illness as terminal, and the two men quarreled bitterly.\n\nWilliam Whistler must have made his trip to Paris in late September or early October 1894. During the visit, the artist drew his brother\u2019s portrait twice (see also cat. 111) in the drawing room of the Whistlers\u2019 home at 110, rue du Bac. Neither of the images was signed, and both were temporarily forgotten. In late October Beatrix sent them to the Ways to be transferred and printed. When Whistler received the first proofs from London, he was pleased with them and ordered \u201c12 more of the Doctor in the unfinished chair\u2014This is really fine\u2014I wish I had sent it to you when [the papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal was] quite fresh\u201d (letter 128). The portrait of the \u201cDoctor in the unfinished chair\u201d was mentioned several times in Whistler\u2019s letters of November 1894. He liked the image and asked the Ways to increase the number of proofs from twelve to thirty, recommending that the image be printed on \u201csmall old Dutch\u201d paper (letter 129).\n\nIn July 1895 Whistler agreed to have one of his lithographs published in a new periodical, The Pageant, edited by Gleeson White and Charles Hazelwood Shannon. The latter selected The Horoscope (cat. 30) and The Doctor as candidates for publication, and Whistler, who generally favored inclusion of his recent work, opted for the portrait of his brother. The machine-printed edition for The Pageant seems to have been pulled in August 1895 by the Ways. The first issue of the periodical, however, was delayed and did not appear until November 1896.\n\nThe Doctor enjoyed considerable visibility during Whistler\u2019s lifetime. It was one of six lithographs that represented the artist at the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d exhibition held at the Champ de Mars in Paris in 1895. It was also included in the 1895\u201396 exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs at the Fine Art Society, where, somewhat surprisingly, no impressions of the portrait were sold. When Whistler died in 1903, twenty-four impressions of The Doctor remained in his estate.\n\nChicago: SC, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 207 mm). Glasgow: HAG (13), cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 192 mm), signed; cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm), signed; cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 195 mm); cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm); ivory laid paper (324 \u00d7 207 mm), in cardboard folder signed and inscribed on cover, in Whistler\u2019s hand, The Doctor; cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 188 mm), signed; cream laid paper (217 \u00d7 196 mm); cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 196 mm).

Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 196 mm), signed; NGA, cream laid paper (218 \u00d7 195 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Another impression is found in Boston, BPL.\n\nPublished edition.The Doctor was published in the first issue of The Pageant in November 1896. Impressions for the periodical edition were machine printed from supplementary stones and can be identified by the medium-weight, off-white, smooth, glossy, and highly calendered wove paper on which they appear. Larger sheets of the same type of paper were used to produce a numbered edition of the periodical. These sheets were adhered along the gutter onto the following page; they were not sewn into the binding itself. As a result, sheet sizes are very inconsistent, although they are always significantly smaller than the sheets on which the text was printed, and to which they were adhered.\n\nChicago: AIC (3), off-white wove paper (291 \u00d7 217 mm), bound; off-white wove paper (292 \u00d7 228 mm); off-white wove paper (253 \u00d7 185 mm), signed Whistler; Palmer, off-white wove paper (254 \u00d7 190 mm). Glasgow: HAG, off-white wove paper (252 \u00d7 183 mm). London: BL, off-white wove paper (252 \u00d7 180 mm), bound; NAL, off-white wove paper (252 \u00d7 184 mm), rebound. Washington: FGA (library), off-white wove paper (253 \u00d7 187 mm), bound; LC, off-white wove paper (252 \u00d7 184 mm).\n\nRemarks: Impressions from the periodical edition are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, MFA; Cleveland, CMA; New York, MMA and NYPL; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.
