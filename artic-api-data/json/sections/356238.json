In The Old Smith\u2019s Story George Govier is seen standing in the light from the furnace, where his older son, Samuel, works the bellows. The distinctive figure of the elderly Govier appears in several lithographs (see cat. 121 and cat. 123), including The Master Smith (cat. 120), where he is shown posing for the artist as he pauses for a drink. The title of the present lithograph suggests that the old smith enjoyed spinning the occasional yarn during Whistler\u2019s visits to the workshop.\n\nAlthough The Old Smith\u2019s Story is not mentioned by title in the correspondence between Whistler and his printers, it was probably one of three transfer drawings that the Ways processed and proved on 8 October 1895 (app. II.4). The other images in this group were The Blacksmith (cat. 127) and The Brothers (cat. 128), both drawings made at the Govier smithy. Whistler received the first proofs of these three subjects, along with proofs of John Grove (cat. 126), by October 10. On that day he wrote to the Ways expressing his disappointment with the images; he instructed the printers to pull no further impressions and added: \u201cDont show them either to anyone\u201d (letter 145). Although Whistler eventually revised The Blacksmith and The Brothers, he never reworked The Old Smith\u2019s Story, and the lithograph was not included in the Fine Art Society exhibition, which opened in mid-December 1895.\n\nLike a number of other Lyme Regis drawings made on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, impressions of The Old Smith\u2019s Story reveal a textured pattern, suggesting that Whistler placed the thin transfer paper over a rougher surface when he drew the image.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 228 mm), signed.
