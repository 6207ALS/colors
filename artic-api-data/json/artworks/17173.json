    "description": "<p>Alcaraz was one of the most famous Spanish cities for the weaving of carpets and other fabrics until the mid-seventeenth century. An exhibition of Alcaraz carpets was held in 1649 in an effort to convince King Philip IV (1605- 1665) to excuse weavers from having to go to war. The king did not change his mind and the production of carpets in Alcaraz came to an end. This type of carpet, called a &quot;Wreath Rug,&quot; began to be produced during the sixteenth century. Such carpets introduced Renaissance floral and border motifs along with a more subtle color palette. This carpet has been cut down. The original would have had seven or eight wreaths on each side.</p>\n",
