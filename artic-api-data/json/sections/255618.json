In 1912 T. R. Way recalled that this lithotint was drawn not at the site, as Limehouse had been, but rather \u201cat one sitting from memory\u201d in the printing offices on Wellington Street. By this date Whistler would have had no trouble recalling the silhouettes of the Battersea side of Chelsea Reach, since it was the view he enjoyed from the windows of both houses he had occupied on Lindsey Row since 1863. He painted the subject under a variety of lighting and atmospheric conditions beginning in 1859 and continuing through the nocturnes of the 1870s. The spire of Battersea Church, the slag heap of the plumbago works, the lighted clock tower of the Morgan Crucible Company (known as \u201cMr. Ted Morgan\u2019s Folly\u201d), and several warehouses and tall chimneys are easily recognizable in the lithotint, despite their reversal during the printing process. Comparable silhouettes are found in Whistler\u2019s painting Nocturne in Blue and Silver (YMSM 113) of 1871/72, now at the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. (1878\u20131879: Early Studies and Lithotints fig. 8).\n\nWhistler worked on a rectangular area of half-tint prepared by the printers, and brushed the Battersea image on the stone in tusche washes of various strengths, much as he would have worked with watercolor washes on paper. The tops of the warehouses, clock tower, church spire, and smokestacks seem to have been softened, perhaps by blotting the wash, to enhance the hazy atmosphere shrouding the distant riverbank. Whistler used the strongest wash to paint in the barge and bargeman in the middle foreground and the ripples in the water at lower right. Finally, after the washes dried, the artist scratched in the distant lights and their reflections. He also scraped around the figure on the barge, between the boat and its reflection, and in the butterfly signature.\n\nWhistler seems to have judged the strength of his washes remarkably well in creating this subtle nocturne. Proofs of the first state, printed on ivory or off-white paper, do have a slightly streaky appearance, a few accidental spots, and some obtrusive areas of pooled wash along the left edge, yet as T. R. Way remembered in 1912, the image \u201cneeded but the slightest retouching.\u201d Subtle changes, primarily the masking of the left edge of the image, were made in the second state, which was issued in an edition of one hundred impressions on \u201cgray-tinted paper mounted upon larger sheets of French plate-paper\u201d (Way (1913)). This paper, which is actually a pale blue laid paper with evenly distributed darker blue fibers, mutes the contrasts of the washes, giving the image an atmospheric quality that is a printed parallel to the subtle harmonies of Whistler\u2019s painted nocturnes. It is not clear if the entire edition was printed in 1878/79, when an unsuccessful attempt was made to enlist subscribers for Whistler\u2019s Art Notes series, or if most impressions were pulled in 1887 for the revamped portfolio project, Notes. The existence of a number of proofs signed in graphite on the plate paper with Whistler\u2019s name rather than the butterfly monogram suggests that at least part of the edition was printed in 1879, when it was still his practice to sign his work this way.\n\nA variety of black inks, ranging from soft gray-blacks to darker, more opaque blacks, was used in the printing of Nocturne. Some impressions are rather grainy in appearance, which suggests that the stone began to clog slightly as printing progressed.\n\nThe left edge has not yet been masked to eliminate irregularly pooled washes. Although Way (1912) recalled that Nocturne was \u201cat first proved upon a very delicate Japanese paper, mounted on plate paper,\u201d impressions of the first state have been found on a variety of papers: plate paper, unmounted Japanese, mounted Japanese, and ivory wove.\n\nChicago: AIC, off-white plate paper (192 \u00d7 277 \u00d7 288 mm), signed; MWC, ivory Japanese paper (198 \u00d7 288 mm), signed. London: BM, cream chine (Japanese paper, 173 \u00d7 266 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (269 \u00d7 377 mm). Washington: FGA, ivory plate paper (261 \u00d7 371 mm); NGA, ivory wove paper (193 \u00d7 279 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Another impression is found in Cambridge, Mass., FAM.\n\nPublished edition. One hundred impressions of Nocturne were issued in Notes portfolios. The image size has been slightly reduced through the masking of the left margin to eliminate most of the pooled washes along this edge. A small vertical streak near the butterfly monogram has also been removed. With the exception of a single example in the Cincinnati Art Museum, all known impressions of the second state were printed on a blue laid paper with blue fibers (chain line interval 27\u201328 mm) and mounted on white wove plate paper, which has often discolored to ivory. The blue paper is roughly the same size in all impressions, having been cut to the approximate dimensions of the image. In fact, the paper is often one or two millimeters smaller than the composition, which has resulted in overprinting onto the secondary sheet.\n\nChicago: AIC, blue laid chine (172 \u00d7 258 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (282 \u00d7 392 mm), signed; MWC, blue laid chine (170 \u00d7 258 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (341 \u00d7 498 mm); Palmer, blue laid chine (170 \u00d7 259 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (309 \u00d7 458 mm). Glasgow: HAG, blue laid chine (171 \u00d7 258 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (380 \u00d7 545 mm), in a Notes set of 6. London: BM, blue laid chine (170 \u00d7 258 mm) mounted on white plate paper (301 \u00d7 405 mm), in a Notes set of 5; V&amp;A, blue laid chine (171 \u00d7 259 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (333 \u00d7 449 mm), in a Notes set of 5. Washington: FGA, blue laid chine (171 \u00d7 257 mm) mounted on white plate paper (380 \u00d7 504 mm), signed Whistler; LC, blue laid paper (171 \u00d7 257 mm), chine removed from secondary support; NGA (2), blue laid chine (171 \u00d7 257 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (363 \u00d7 550 mm), signed Whistler; blue laid chine (170 \u00d7 259 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (343 \u00d7 503 mm), in a Notes set of 5.\n\nRemarks: Impressions in Notes sets of 6 are found in Boston, MFA; and New York, NYPL. Impressions in Notes sets of 5 are found in Boston, BPL; and New York, MMA. One of 2 impressions in Cincinnati, CAM, is printed on cream Japanese paper mounted on white plate paper. Inscribed Thos. Way 6 Gough Square and II in red and blue crayon by Thomas Way, the image shows signs of clogging, and may be a proof pulled by the printers to check the condition of the stone late in the printing of the second state. Other impressions are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA (signed Whistler); Cleveland, CMA; New Haven, YUAG (signed Whistler); and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
