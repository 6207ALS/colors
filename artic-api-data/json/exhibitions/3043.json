    "short_description": "Across the continent of Africa unique and often surprising ceramic vessels have been created for domestic and ritual uses. Potters still practice centuries-old techniques, making wares by hand and firing them in the open to produce vessels of amazing durability. The most striking examples embody an immediacy of form and a deceptive simplicity that can only be achieved through a deeply ingrained understanding of material, process, and embellishment. This exhibition and its accompanying catalogue will showcase a virtuoso group of African ceramics from the Keith Achepohl collection.",
