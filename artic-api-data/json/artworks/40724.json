    "description": "<p><em>The Story of Meleager and Atalanta</em> is based on the version of the legend that appears in Ovid\u2019s <em>Metamorphoses</em>. Meleager was the son of Oeneus, the king of Calydon. One day the goddess Artemis, enraged by Oeneus\u2019s failure to honor her appropriately, sent a wild boar to ravage Calydon\u2019s fields. Meleager organized a hunting party to kill the animal. Atalanta, the daughter of the king of Arcadia, was the only woman in the group. As soon as Meleager laid eyes on her, he fell in love. Atalanta wounded the boar with an arrow and Meleager killed it with a spear. The prince honored the princess for drawing first blood, declaring her queen of the hunt and offering her the boar\u2019s head. Meleager\u2019s uncles were jealous, and tried to steal the trophy. Blinded by love and rage, Meleager killed them. The tapestry shows Meleager returning the boar\u2019s head to Atalanta.</p>\n",
