    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In twelfth century Japan a cult developed around Jizo, the Buddhist figure seen here. This wood sculpture with applied colors and gold presents Jizo with a shaved head wearing the garb of a monk. His delicately carved and painted face expresses compassion as well as dignity. Jizo\u2019s raised left hand holds a wish granting jewel. His right hand holds a staff with small rings. Monks carried the shakuj\u014d or monk\u2019s staff to signal their approach while absorbing the rule of silence as they begged for alms. The sound also warned insects and other tiny creature in the path before a monk could step on them fulfilling the Buddhist precept of compassion for all living things. Jizo personifies one of the compassionate spirits known as a bosatsu or bodhisattva. He saved souls from the sufferings of hell. He also provided for children and unprotected women making him one of the most beloved and approachable deities in Japanese Buddhism.</p>\n",
