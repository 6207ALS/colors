Ryerson Collection, 1933.1150\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Charing Cross Bridge, London was executed on a pre-primed, no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size linen canvas. The painting appears to retain its original stretcher. The number 30 stenciled on the back of the stretcher probably refers to the stretcher size. The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. A warp-thread match was determined with two other paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection: Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155) and The Customs House at Varengeville (cat. 35 [W1455], inv. 1933.1149), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of fabric. The painting has a heavily brush marked surface. Crisp brushstrokes introduced in the earlier paint layers remain visible on the surface through the thin, fluid brushstrokes applied on top. In some places, the canvas texture remains prominent through light applications of paint that deposited mainly on the peaks of the canvas weave. The artist also appears to have scraped or wiped the upper paint layers in localized areas, revealing colors from underneath. In some places, small areas of interlayer cleavage have resulted, due to poor adhesion between the layers. The artist made a significant change in the perspective of the scene. The technical examination shows that major compositional elements, including the bridge supports, the bridge house, the embankment, and the buildings were all originally painted further left of their positions in the final painting. In addition, more of Westminster Bridge, in the distance, was originally included, its arches initially extending further to the left edge of the canvas. The painting was originally signed at the lower left corner. This signature was then painted over, probably in conjunction with further reworking of the painting, and then signed again in the lower-right corner.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 40.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1901 (lower right, in blue paint) (fig. 40.2). Some of the strokes of pale-pinkish-purple paint were still wet when the signature was applied. These strokes may represent finishing touches added by the artist before signing the painting.\n\nAt the lower left corner, there are traces of another signature that was subsequently painted over (fig. 40.3). This signature was also executed in blue paint (fig. 40.4). It is difficult to make out the second half of the signature, which may indicate that the paint was at least partially scraped or wiped away before subsequent paint layers were applied. It is not clear whether the painting was also dated in this area, but microscopic traces of similar blue paint extend sufficiently far to the right to suggest this possibility. It looks like the signature was dry when the yellowish-green paint from the water was applied on top. It is clear that some wiping or scraping of the paint surface, similar to that observed elsewhere in the painting (see Application/technique), occurred after the signature was painted out. The paint appears flattened and abraded in areas, with underlying layers exposed at the surface. There are small, localized areas of associated interlayer cleavage where separation has occurred between the upper, yellowish-green paint and the lower paint layers including the signature (fig. 40.5). The pale-pink and pale-purple strokes of the water were applied after the abrasion and interlayer cleavage had occurred.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond closely to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size stretcher (65 \u00d7 92 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.4V (0.6) \u00d7 20.9H (0.7) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155) and The Customs House at Varengeville (cat. 35 [W1455], inv. 1933.1149).\n\nThere is mild cusping along the top and bottom edges of the canvas, moderate cusping on the left edge, and more pronounced and irregular cusping along the right edge.\n\nThe painting appears to retain its original stretching. The canvas is attached with iron tacks spaced 5.5\u20137.5 cm apart. The cusping corresponds to the placement of the original tacks. There are a few additional small holes on each tacking edge, which appear to be more recent. Excess canvas wraps around the back edge of the stretcher on all sides.\n\nThe painting appears to retain its original stretcher (fig. 40.6). It is five membered with a vertical crossbar and keyable, mortise and tenon joints. All ten keys are present (lower crossbar key broken but still functional). Dimensions: outer depth, 2.0 cm; inner depth, 1.8 cm; stretcher-bar width, 6.0 cm (left, right, and bottom), 6.4 cm (top); crossbar depth, 1.3 cm; crossbar width, 6.2 cm.\n\nThe number 30 is stenciled on the back of the stretcher (fig. 40.7). This probably refers to the standard-size stretcher.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 20 to 105 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 40.8).\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark and possibly red or brown particles visible under magnification (fig. 40.9).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting was densely built up over most of the surface, as evidenced by the relative radio-opacity of much of the paint layer in the X-ray (fig. 40.10). The paint layers are continuous, completely concealing the ground layer, except near the edges of the work. The thick buildup of paint is partly related to the fact that the artist made significant changes to the placement of the major compositional elements. The vertical supports of Charing Cross Bridge, as well as the bridge house, the embankment in the lower right corner, and the towers of the Houses of Parliament were all originally painted to the immediate left of their final positions. The outlines of the earlier forms are most clearly seen when the painting is viewed in transmitted light (fig. 40.11). With the use of transmitted infrared, the horizontal line of the railroad tracks can be seen to continue straight across to the right edge of the canvas, underneath the bridge house in the final painting (fig. 40.12). In addition, the perspective of Westminster Bridge, faintly visible in the distance, was also altered slightly: the arches painted in the earlier composition are offset from their position in the final painting; and, in the earlier painting, five or six arches were depicted, continuing further to the left edge of the painting, underneath the area later covered by the steam from the train (fig. 40.13). These changes suggest that the artist shifted his viewpoint of the scene and that the steam train on Charing Cross Bridge may not have been conceived for the first composition or, at least, was not incorporated early in the painting process.\n\nOverall, the painting is relatively flat with no impasto. It does, however, have a heavily brush marked surface (fig. 40.14). Much of this texture was introduced in the early painting stages; for example, the crisp horizontal strokes that run through broad areas of the sky (fig. 40.15) and the crisscrossed strokes in the water (fig. 40.16), the texture of which remain evident through the subsequent buildup of paint layers applied on top. These underlying strokes appear to be related to the earlier composition, as they seem to conform to the edges of the painted-out forms. For example, the horizontal brush marks in the sky, which pass underneath the towers of the Parliament buildings in the final painting, seem to stop on either side of the earlier towers that were painted out (fig. 40.17). Further texture was incorporated into the paint surface through the artist\u2019s use of different paint applications and treatments. For example, a corrugated texture was created in some areas through the successive buildup of paint layers that were lightly applied and deposited mainly on the high points of the canvas weave (fig. 40.18, fig. 40.19). In some areas, slightly thicker and more fluid paint applications provide a relatively smooth, flat surface, obscuring much of the texture of the layers underneath (fig. 40.20). In localized areas, including the steam from the train, the fluid paint was worked wet-into-wet (fig. 40.21, fig. 40.22). In other areas, the artist appears to have lightly scraped or wiped the upper layers, breaking up the paint surface by locally revealing colors from underlying layers (fig. 40.23, fig. 40.24). This is especially visible in parts of the sky, where the abrasion reveals the peaks of the lighter-hued, horizontal brushstrokes from underneath (fig. 40.25, fig. 40.26). Often, in association with the scraping or wiping, some interlayer cleavage has occurred (fig. 40.27). For the most part, the underlying paint looks like it was already dry when it was painted over, as the ridges of the brush marks remained undisturbed. This probably resulted in weak adhesion between the layers, leading to separation when the artist worked back into the surface (fig. 40.28). The edges of the interlayer cleavage losses appear soft, suggesting that the upper paint layers were still somewhat fluid when the cleavage occurred (fig. 40.29). Some final paint strokes were applied over these localized areas of interlayer cleavage, including parts of the final signature, and the isolated purple strokes that skip across the surface of the sky. There are several small inclusions (possibly dried paint picked up on the brush) embedded in the paint layer.\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 and 2.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1993 and left unvarnished (see Conservation History). It has a soft yet variable surface, with relatively matte passages as well as areas of smooth, fluid paint application that have a slightly glossy sheen. In 1971, the painting was reported to have a discolored and yellowed, soft resin varnish layer; its origin is unknown.\n\nThe 1972 pretreatment notes state that there were scattered abrasions, especially in the left sky and foreground, which had previously been overpainted. There is some evidence of this in the 1971 pretreatment UV photograph in the sky at upper left, but more apparent is the minor inpainting visible in the sky, right of center and at the upper right edge. All of this retouching appears to be related to the interlayer cleavage resulting from the artist\u2019s technique of scraping or wiping the paint surface (see Application/technique).\n\nIn 1972, discolored surface films and overpaint were removed. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Paint losses were inpainted. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 1991, the synthetic varnish layers and previous retouching were removed. Three small interlayer cleavage losses in the sky at upper left were inpainted.\n\nThe painting is in near-pristine condition. It is unlined and appears to retain its original stretcher and tacking. The canvas is stretched taut and is relatively planar, except for mild draws at the upper left, lower left, and lower right corners. The paint layer is in excellent condition. Small areas of interlayer cleavage throughout the painting appear to be related to the artist\u2019s technique (i.e., possible scraping) (see Application/technique). There is mild abrasion in the ground and paint layers at the edges, with minor, associated retouching along the left edge. Other areas of retouching\u2014in the sky at upper left and near the lower left corner\u2014appear to be related to the interlayer cleavage losses. There are localized areas of fine cracking, which are only visible under magnification. A few localized areas of microscopic wrinkling were observed in areas of more-fluid paint application. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches with cabochon centers on a quadrillage bed, leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding and a nonoriginal independent fillet liner. The frame has both water and oil gilding. The liner has been painted gold. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the cast foliate on the ogee and sight molding, and the scotia sides. Red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. No bole was applied to the quadrillage bed of the ogee face. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The frame has an overall light brass tone with an even toning wash, on top of which casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes and dark flecking were applied. The frame has a glued poplar substrate that is mitered and nailed with glued half-lap braces with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized, running undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 40.30, fig. 40.31).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Oct. 30, 1905, for 8,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Adrien H\u00e9brard, as agent for the Prince de Wagram (Alexandre Berthier, 4th Prince de Wagram), Paris, Dec. 20, 1905, for 15,000 francs.\n\nSold by the Prince de Wagram (Alexandre Berthier, 4th Prince de Wagram), Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 4, 1914, for 15,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Nov. 11 or Dec. 9, 1915.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

The Art Institute currently uses a title that is based on the title used by the catalogue raisonn\u00e9.

Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains cobalt blue and lead white; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CharX\\_33\\_1150\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings examined for this project, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a more sketchy state, with areas of ground left exposed. John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171, notes that \u201cMonet\u2019s stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 [. . .] insisted on several occasions that, in the studio, \u2018[Monet] signed his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_analytical report,\u201d June 12, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Charing Cross Bridge, London, 1901(W1527/1933.1150),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1281, W1455, W1527,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nIron was confirmed by XRF; see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CharX\\_33\\_1150\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from the cross sections.\n\nPLM analysis identified intact microfossils. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 12, 2014.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. Trace amounts of iron were detected in the area of the ground analyzed by XRF. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 12, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 7, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CharX\\_33\\_1150\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe X-ray reveals another contour, which echoes the edge of the embankment, even further to the left.\n\nNo tool marks were observed, making it difficult to speculate on how the artist achieved this effect.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were re-examined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 12, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1150\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 17, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CharX\\_33\\_1150\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
