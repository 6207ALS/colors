    "description": "<p>Charles Frost (1856\u20131931) established a sixteen-year architectural partnership with Henry Ives Cobb in Chicago in 1882. The firm produced such notable buildings as the Union League Club and the Newberry Library, as well as several buildings for the University of Chicago. In a subsequent partnership with Alfred H. Granger, Frost was well known for designing railway stations in the Chicago region. This single volume letterpress copybook contains Frost\u2019s copies of bills for services rendered, contract prices, cost breakdowns for contractors\u2019 bids, and other financial matters between 1922 and 1930. At this late period in his life, Frost\u2019s work was mainly the remodeling of buildings which he had designed earlier in his career.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Frost,%20Charles%20S.,%20Letterpress%20Copybook/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Frost,%20Charles%20Sumner/field/creato;%20additi;%20contri/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Find all Charles Sumner Frost digital images.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
