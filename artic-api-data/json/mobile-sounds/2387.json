    "transcript": "<p>MATT WITKOVKSY: Posters were the most prestigious and closely supervised mass-media art form. This is because posters were a key way to get across Soviet policy aims and ideas. They were printed in up to several hundred thousand copies at a time and plastered across the country. In the late 1920s posters by the husband-and-wife team of Gustav Klutsis and Valentina Kulagina helped to spread news of a new, state-sponsored worker ideal: the shock worker.</p>\n<p>KATE TAHK: A shock worker is a super-productive worker. It\u2019s a worker who exceeds their production quota by, usually, a dramatic amount. And it\u2019s from the root of udar, which is like a blow, or \u201cto strike,\u201d in Russian.  Udarnik. Or udarnitsa, because \u2026 women get a separate word, and there\u2019s also female shock workers. They\u2019re just as important.</p>\n<p>MATT WITKOVKSY: Klutsis and Kulagina deeply understood their role as modeling ideal behavior with these posters. Slogans provided models in the sense of standards to follow or aspire to. And Klutsis and his friends actually modeled for their posters. It\u2019s Klutsis\u2019s own hand that we see reproduced lots of times in the poster commanding \u201cWorker Men and Women: Everyone Vote in the Soviet Elections.\u201d And it\u2019s Klutsis with fellow designer Sergei Sen\u2019kin who are the miners in the poster \u201cThe Struggle for Fuel and Metal.\u201d</p>\n",
