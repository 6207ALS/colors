    "description": "<p>In this print, Shutend\u00f4ji, the legendary demon who preyed on young women, is assisted through his palace after a banquet. The long months of the year are on his garment, and the short months appear on the garments of the assistant on the right. This is a particularly luxurious print, with many elements created in gold and silver leaf (the latter has now tarnished to black).<br>Komatsuya Hyakki is virtually unknown in the history of ukiyo-e, yet he was an important figure of his day. He was the proprietor of a pharmacy in Edo, and he was a poet, author, artist, and patron in premier cultural circles. It seems that Hyakki may have been an important influence on Suzuki Harunobu, the artist of most of the prints on display in this exhibition. The two probably exchanged images by themselves and other artists, and Hyakki is thought to have possibly commissioned designs from Harunobu.</p>\n",
