    "short_description": "Britain\u2019s triumph over France in the Seven Years\u2019 War marked its emergence as a global power. The Franco-British Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Britain control over India, which in turn encouraged British citizens to travel to the subcontinent. In the later 18th century, a series of British military victories in India intensified interest in the new colony among the British public.",
