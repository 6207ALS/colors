    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator Janice Katz.</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: So in this gallery, which we\u2019re calling \u201cEarly Ideals of Beauty,\u201d is where we start to get<br>images of these bijin, these beauties, a singular beauty on each hanging scroll. In this painting, we see<br>one particularly high-ranking courtesan who is shown walking towards the right, gathering her heavy<br>robes up in one hand. Her outer robe, in particular, has this incredible lavish detail. Several patterns are<br>going on, of chrysanthemums against the dark ground as well as mulberry leaves against the gray<br>ground. The dark ground that is around the chrysanthemums was originally silver. It\u2019s a silver pigment<br>that has oxidized and turned darker over the years. The red robe that she wears under her outer robe is<br>painted with these interesting lines, short lines, throughout, probably to indicate some kind of heavy<br>fabric, tufted fabric like a velvet of some sort.</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: So red is a color that one often finds on the inside inner robes, and it really sets off the<br>paleness of her skin and the scene, in many ways, as something that is erotic. I mean, red is the color. If<br>a kimono had red in it, it was considered colorful; if it did not have red, even if it had other colors, it was<br>considered not colorful.</p>\n",
