Columns of writing which separate the Horus-sons at the ends read, \"Utterance by Osiris the august house-mistress Wenuhotep, deceased, daughter of the priest...Thothhirthaw. \" 2.) The deceased on a lion bier (note the lion's head, tail, and legs). Above is the winged sun disk, emblem of Horus of Edfu, the hawk god who appears at each end of the band. Below are grouped the four canopic jars. The inscriptions which begin here are continued farther down, after skipping the next register. That at the mummy's left prays for a royal offering of Osiris, presided over the West, the great god, lord of Abydos; may he give an offering. As space gave out here, the text breaks off abruptly witout the usual detailed list of wants. At the right Wenuhotep's mother is named: Her mother, the house-mistress Bast [     ], deceased, revered in the presence of the great god, the lord of the sky. 3.) The sun god in his barque, worshiped at either side by an ape.",
