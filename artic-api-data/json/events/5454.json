Together they will discuss Tiravanija\u2019s&nbsp;installation&nbsp;<em>(who\u2019s afraid of red, yellow, and green), </em>currently on view at <a href=\"https://wrightwood659.org/exhibitions/rirkrit-tiravanija-whos-afraid-of-red-yellow-and-green/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wrightwood 659</a>.</p><p>This immersive installation of Tiravanija\u2019s signature culinary work transforms Wrightwood 659\u2019s second-floor gallery into a communal dining space where visitors are periodically offered Thai curries and encouraged to share a meal together. The installation includes a large-scale mural referencing protests against Thai government policies, and images of protest from DC and Chicago, concurrently drawn on the walls by local artists over the course of the exhibition.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rirkrit Tiravanija: (who\u2019s afraid of red, yellow, and green)</em> is organized by the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, and presented by Alphawood Exhibitions at Wrightwood 659.</p><p>This program is presented in partnership with Wrightwood 659, a private, non-collecting initiative devoted to architecture and socially engaged art. Located at 659 W. Wrightwood Avenue in Chicago\u2019s Lincoln Park neighborhood, the intimate space was designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Tadao Ando, who transformed the interior of a 1920s building with his signature concrete forms and poetic treatment of natural light.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum. </strong>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
