    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: If you look at the top three rows of animals depicted on the side of this wine pitcher you can see here and there an animal with a raised head. Its tail is curled across its back, its mouth agape. This creature is a lion. The picture was made in the Greek city-state of Corinth in the seventh century B.C.E. But the Corinthian artist who created these animal figures had probably never seen a lion in person. He copied it from art imagery that had migrated from the East. Prior to this so-called Orientalizing period, Greek phases tended to have mostly geometric designs. The introduction of animal and human forms occurred as trade increased between East and West. Located along a narrow strip of land on the Aegean Sea Corinth was a major hub of sea trade. This exposure and contact between two worlds revolutionized the way Greek artists depicted their world.</p>\n",
