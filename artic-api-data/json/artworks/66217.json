    "description": "<p>Initially trained as a painter at the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Munich, Frank Eugene began incorporating photographs as preliminary studies around 1894 to assist in the execution of his portraits. As his interest in photography flourished, he often manipulated his negatives by paint or etching. His work caught the attention of Alfred Stieglitz, who gave him his first solo exhibition, devoted an issue of <em>Camera Notes</em> to his work, and invited him to join the Photo-Secession, a group of photographers striving for recognition in the fine arts. Though the identity of the subjects in this photograph and the exact nature of their (seemingly intimate) relationship are unknown, it is likely that the models are seated in Eugene\u2019s studio. The chiaroscuro effect and Eugene\u2019s rich, matte platinum print illustrate the Pictorialist aesthetic prized by the members of the Photo-Secession.</p>\n<p>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n",
