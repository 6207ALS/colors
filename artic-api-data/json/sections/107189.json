This was perhaps a reworking, intended to unify the composition. The contraption is decorated with a grinning, skull-like head, a motif that appears in other works by Ensor. His 1883 drawing The Clownish Peasants (fig. 1) includes in its background a balloon bearing a face and a streamer labeled \u00c0 l\u2019aventure, while in his Tribulations of Saint Anthony a hot-air balloon hovers in the sky above the saint (fig. 2). The features of the face give it a lively, almost human, presence, but they are rendered macabre by the balloon\u2019s apparent deflation.\n\nOdilon Redon included floating, balloon-like heads with faces in the drawing Guardian Spirit of the Waters (fig. 3) and in several of his prints, including The Eye like a Strange Balloon Moves toward Infinity (fig. 4), plate 1 of the series Homage to Poe. Although this latter work was owned by Belgian writer Jules Destr\u00e9e, it was not exhibited by Redon at the 1886 salon of Les XX (Les Vingt; 1883\u201393). Yet another balloon-like head appears in Sad Ascent (fig. 5), part of the series Dans la r\u00eave (In Dreams). Three lithographs from an edition of this series owned by Issac Israels were shown at Les XX in 1886 (this did not, however, include Sad Ascent).\n\nBy the later nineteenth century, hot-air balloons were colorfully decorated and often used for advertising and self-promotion (see fig. 6, fig. 7, and fig. 8). They also appeared frequently in late-nineteenth-century magazines and posters and were the subject of cabaret songs. Aristide Bruant\u2019s \u201cV\u2019la l\u2019ballon!,\u201d for instance, commemorated the large balloon on view at the 1878 Universal Exposition. See sheet 3B for further discussion of hot-air balloons. SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 James Ensor (Belgian, 1860\u20131949). The Clownish Peasants, c. 1883.
