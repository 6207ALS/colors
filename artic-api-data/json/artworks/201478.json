    "description": "<p><em>Sister Tuesday</em> is one of a series of sculptures by self-taught artist Leslie Bolling, each one a sensitive rendition of the daily labors of African American men and women. He hand carved figures in soft poplar wood, here adding gold pigment to suggest the metallic surface of bronze. Although he considered his practice a hobby, his work soon drew the attention of art world critics and patrons of the Harlem Renaissance. He exhibited throughout the decade, and in 1938 helped found and taught at the Craig House Art Center, a Works Progress Administration community organization in his hometown of Richmond, Virginia, which was the only one in the segregated South open to African Americans.</p>\n",
