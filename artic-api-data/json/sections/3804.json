Part of a larger development taking root across France that came to be known as the \u201creturn to order,\u201d Matisse\u2019s new naturalism took its most prominent form in portraits, including the more than fifty paintings of the Italian model Laurette (see cat. 23 and cat. 26) that he had completed by the end of that year. By the spring of 1918, when he likely made Woman with a Shawl, in a Garden, he was firmly focused on the human form, though he had yet to find another professional model. His new stylistic approach is visible in the restrained pencil line of the Art Institute\u2019s work and his attention to descriptive detail. The drawing presents a woman\u2014whose costume nearly covers her entire body but whose form Matisse relates to us through the careful folds of her shawl and skirt\u2014seated on a bench in a garden. The organic curves of the model and scenery contrast with the rectilinear tripod that stands upright on the opposite side of the composition.\n\nRelated in style is Young Girl with Long Hair. The model for this drawing is Antoinette Arnoux, who began to work with Matisse in January 1919. It is among the fifty studies of the model that Matisse selected for reproduction in his book Cinquante dessins par Henri-Matisse, which he self-published in 1920. Young Girl with Long Hair shows Arnoux with her long, thick hair falling around her shoulders. Matisse clearly took pleasure in his model\u2019s youth and freshness. She is dressed in a simple, sleeveless shift. Her full, pouting lips form a focal point just above the hand on which she rests her chin.\n\nMatisse\u2019s drawings from this time vary dramatically in technique, and his many studies of Arnoux, made in 1918 and 1919 in Nice and Issy-les-Moulineaux, range from highly detailed, descriptive images to linear depictions of great simplicity. Young Girl with Long Hair falls somewhere between these two extremes. Executed in pencil, it is a naturalistic rendering of the subject. Matisse applied the graphite in long, bold strokes that emphasize the weight of the young woman\u2019s tresses and the round volumes of her arms. He modeled the body using strong, parallel hatching, the marks often blunt like the lines of an etching. However, this is not the only way he employed his pencil at this time nor with this subject. Another frontal portrait of Arnoux from this period (fig. 27-28.3) reveals the artist taking a more nuanced approach. One is almost unaware of individual marks; instead, Matisse defined the planes of the face and the waves of hair with a highly refined network of careful graphite strokes. In both works, the model\u2019s almond-shaped eyes, full mouth, and luxuriant hair provide the essence of the image. While the subject is the same and the compositions similar, the effects are quite different. As art historian Victor I. Carlson observed, \u201cThe drawings of Antoinette mark an unexpected stylistic change in the artist\u2019s draftsmanship. Never before had Matisse so openly delighted in his fluent command of his materials.\u201d\n\nIn late 1917 and early 1918, Matisse visited Pierre-Auguste Renoir at his home at Les Collettes, Cagne-sur-Mer. He particularly admired Renoir\u2019s treatment of the female nude, and it is noteworthy that Matisse sought out the older artist in the months prior to commencing his own intensive work with Arnoux for the Cinquante dessins project. Indeed, this was a time during which Matisse was re-evaluating Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. His canvases dating from the early years in Nice reveal an obsession with the effects of light and color, a fascination that prompted him to look again at the works of Pierre Bonnard, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Claude Monet, and Renoir. In so doing, he was also trying to assess his own place within modern art and, with the publication of Cinquante dessins, to establish his personal contribution.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro and Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work was titled Woman with Shawl in Art Institue of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, ed.
