    "description": "<p>Bisa Butler creates arresting portraits\u2014composed entirely of vibrantly colored and patterned fabrics\u2014that reimagine and celebrate narratives of Black life.&nbsp;</p><p>Butler often works with photographs as source images, reimagining the figures captured as attentive portraits with layers of color and stitched details. She strategically selects fabrics, using the history or imagery of the prints to reinforce the stories she wants to communicate in each quilt. Layering materials and meanings, Butler brings to life personal and historical narratives of Black life and invites viewers to look closely and think deeply about the potential and purposes of portraiture.</p><p>Butler\u2019s work has been shaped by a variety of influences and experiences, key among them family photo albums, the philosophies of AfriCOBRA (the African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists, established in Chicago in the late 1960s), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33562/romare-howard-bearden\" target=\"_blank\">Romare Bearden</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93903/the-return-of-odysseus-homage-to-pinturicchio-and-benin\" target=\"_blank\">collages</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/56742/faith-ringgold\" target=\"_blank\">Faith Ringgold</a>\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/160098/bessie-s-blues-from-the-series-american-collection-number-5\" target=\"_blank\"> mixed-media quilts</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/20027/gordon-parks\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Parks</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223911/pastor-ledbetter-chicago-illinois\" target=\"_blank\">photographs</a>.
