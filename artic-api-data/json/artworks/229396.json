    "description": "<p>Street artist, graphic designer, and activist Shepard Fairey created this visionary portrait of then Senator Barack Obama in 2008 as a form of grassroots activism to support Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign. Fairey based the work on an Associated Press photograph by Mannie Garcia, which he transformed with his signature high-contrast stencil technique, inspired by the political message and bold graphics of Soviet Socialist Realism. First disseminated as a street poster, the image was later used to create thousands of stickers and T-shirts and was widely circulated online.</p>\n<p>Emblazoned with the word \u201cHope\u201d and featuring reds and blues that complement the campaign logo designed by Sol Sender, Fairey\u2019s portrait was quickly adopted as an official image of Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign. New Yorker art critic Peter Schjeldahl called the poster \u201cthe most efficacious American political illustration since \u2018Uncle Sam Wants You.\u2019\u201d</p>\n",
