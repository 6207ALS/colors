Robinson, 1949.1228\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent bubbly aquamarine, translucent gray-blue, and opaque white and brick-red glass. Cup fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves a small segment of the outsplayed rim and double carinated profile. The mosaic pattern is formed from sections of a single cane in a gray-blue ground with a central red dot and a concentric white ring surrounded by a ring of ten white dots. There appears to be a matrix of bubbly aquamarine glass between these canes that reads as occasional streaks. The gray-blue cane ground is the predominant color.\n\nSmall segment of rim preserved, all other edges are broken. The back and edges retain a light-brown weathering crust and incrustation; the interior has been repolished and pits in the surface still retain this same weathering product.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 87 Fragment of a Cup, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
