    "copy": " Gustave Caillebotte's Paris Street; Rainy Day This masterpiece by Gustave Caillebotte represents the changing urban milieu of late 19th-century Paris. Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions.   Joan Mitchell's City Landscape In City Landscape , a tangle of various colors\u2014pale pink, scarlet, mustard, sienna, and black\u2014evokes the streets of a bustling metropolis. The spontaneous energy conveyed in the composition is at odds with Mitchell\u2019s slow and deliberate process.   Pablo Picasso's The Old Guitarist In the paintings of Picasso\u2019s Blue Period (1901\u201304), the artist restricted himself to a cold, monochromatic blue palette, flattened forms, and emotional, psychological themes of human misery and alienation. This painting re\ufb02ects the 22-year-old Picasso\u2019s personal struggle and sympathy for the plight of the downtrodden.   Vincent van Gogh's The Bedroom Vincent van Gogh painted three versions, including this one, of his bedroom in the \u201cYellow House\u201d in Arles, France. To Van Gogh, this picture symbolized relaxation and peace. However, to our eyes the canvas seems to teem with nervous energy, instability, and turmoil\u2014an effect heightened by the sharply receding perspective.   Buddha Shakyamuni The largest Buddha in the mainland United States, this monumental granite sculpture originally would have graced a monastic site at Nagapattinam. This Buddha is seated with his legs in the meditating posture of padmasana, or lotus position, and with his hands resting on his lap.   Marc Chagall\u2019s America Windows Delve into the story of these stained glass windows that Chagall created to celebrate the arts of music, painting, literature, theater, and dance and the United States as a place of cultural and religious freedom.   Georges Seurat\u2019s A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884 Spend some time with Seurat\u2019s timeless pointillist masterpiece and learn more about its enduring mysteries, revolutionary technique, and underlying color theory.   Archibald John Motley Jr.\u2019s Nightlife Dig deeper into Motley's electrifying portrayal of a Chicago jazz club and discover more about its dazzling color palette, compositional tricks, and the fellow Art Institute artwork that inspired it.   Coronation Stone of Motecuhzoma II See all sides of this remarkable Aztec object marking Motecuhzoma\u2019s coronation and understand its many symbols\u2014from the plants and animals that indicate dates to the central x-shaped element that conveys the Aztecs\u2019 understanding of their place in the cosmos.   Edward Hopper\u2019s Nighthawks Take a closer look at Hopper\u2019s classic American painting and consider how some of its unsettling elements\u2014clashing colors, lack of depth, and no diner door!\u2014are key to its abiding appeal.   Olowe of Ise\u2019s Veranda Post Experience the beauty and majesty of this Yoruban post originally meant for the Nigerian king\u2019s palace and discover how its many characters\u2014an imposing queen, the seated king, a trickster god, and a junior wife\u2014all work together to ensure the success of the kingdom.
