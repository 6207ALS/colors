    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the years following the end of World War Two, American art and design began to show a very modern esthetic. Materials that had been restricted to industrial use, like chrome and aluminum, now became essential elements of forward-looking designs. Motifs such as circles, spheres and rods, brought to mind models of atomic structures. A perfect example is the electric clock on the wall in front of you. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE:  It was one of the most popular designs of its time. George Nelson later rather ruefully commented that as a sort of all-time bestseller for Howard Miller, the Howard Miller Clock Company, suddenly it was decided by Mrs. America that this was the clock to put in your kitchen. Why the kitchen? I don\u2019t know. But every ad that showed a kitchen for years after that, had a ball clock on it. Of course the clock's primary design was for offices, but it did become popular in the home and primarily in the kitchen.</p>\n",
