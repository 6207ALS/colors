    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:<br>Judith Barter, Field \u00acMcCormick Chair &amp; Curator, American Arts.</p>\n<p>JUDITH BARTER:<br>\u2018Nighthawks\u2019 is a really fascinating painting. It's such an American painting.  The Americanness is in many of the details: The \u2018Phillies Cigar\u2019 ad above the diner. The salt shakers, the heavy-duty porcelain mugs. The napkin holders. The big coffee urns in the back. The soda jerk, with his cap on. It\u2019s what America was like and what America liked in the '30s and '40s.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:<br>But look closer. There\u2019s something unrealistic\u2014and off-putting\u2014about Edward Hopper\u2019s scene.</p>\n<p>JUDITH BARTER:<br>It looks real, but it\u2019s not. There's no sense of real depth. When you try to go deep into this picture, it pushes you back to the surface. He uses acid greens against bright yellows and oranges\u2014the red dress of the woman with her orange hair. These set your teeth on edge, but they do work together; he was a brilliant colorist.] And if you look at the diner, there's no way in or out except through that orange door that ostensibly goes to the kitchen. So it's sort of a hermetically-sealed environment with these four people in this diner at night.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:<br>And\u2026no one is talking. To many, \u2018Nighthawks\u2019 evokes a sense of loneliness. But Hopper himself disagreed with this interpretation. In an interview, he said.</p>\n<p>[EDWARD HOPPER ARCHIVAL AUDIO]:<br>I think those are the words of critics. It may be true, it may not be true. It\u2019s how the viewer looks on the pictures. What he sees in them.</p>\n<p>JUDITH BARTER:<br>What I see in Hopper is a sense of everyman. That any of us could be sitting in this diner. it's really the idea of we are individuals, but we have a collective consciousness as well. I think people just relate to the everydayness of it. They can put themselves in these pictures.</p>\n",
