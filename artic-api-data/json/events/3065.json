    "description": "<p>The theme for this month's Intersections is the relationship between visual culture and public opinion. Artists have looked to popular news sources and lifestyle magazines as sources for their work because of the power of mass produced visual culture to shape public opinion and ideas. At a time when the proper role of traditional journalism has been called into question, we\u2019ll use images produced about the Vietnam War to delve into questions of truth, politics, and persuasion.</p><p>In this new interactive lecture series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Educators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p> </p>",
