Frequently, he turned to the biblical story of the fall of man; the many times he depicted Eve, in various guises and in many media, evidences his fascination with the subject. The present work features an Eve with Polynesian facial features.\n\nOne of the most influential readings of Gauguin\u2019s representations of Eve is that of Henri Dorra, who divided them into two categories: a \u201cfallen\u201d Eve, who has succumbed to temptation, and an \u201cinnocent\u201d Eve, who is unaware of her sexuality. Though this polarity is questionable\u2014Gauguin\u2019s views on sexual conduct were extremely liberal\u2014there are formal aspects of this Eve that place her with those who have \u201csinned.\u201d Her facial expression expresses melancholy as she looks away from the viewer. This\u2014and her tense hands, one covering her genitals with a cloth and the other touching her cheek\u2014indicates that she is aware of her nudity. It is possible, however, that Gauguin\u2019s representation implies no negative moral judgment on Eve\u2019s conduct. Instead, in a period during which European artists such as he saw non-Western women as sexually liberated, his decision to depict his Eve as Tahitian confronts European ideas of right and wrong.\n\nTechnical examination revealed that the paper support of Tahitian Eve originated in one of the sketchbooks that Gauguin took on his first Tahitian journey (see Technical Study). Like many other pages from the artist\u2019s Tahitian sketchbooks, this sheet was removed from its original binding at an undetermined time.\n\nGauguin drew Tahitian Eve: Words of the Devil in two distinct layers. Initially, he mapped out the figure using a vibrant, violet-colored ink, now faded to brown (see Technical Study). He then added a second layer of marks in dark-black ink, giving the figure a second outline rather than tracing over his initial line. He filled in areas such as the hair with bold black hatching, a strategy that has the effect of flattening the figure\u2019s form, whether intentionally or otherwise. So too the diagonal hatch marks on her body might indicate a shadow, but they do not provide modeling or help create the illusion of three-dimensionality. Instead, extending from the figure\u2019s legs into the space between, the lines seem to function primarily as a decorative element. A short line connects the back of the subject\u2019s heel with the middle of her foot, which could indicate that she is standing on a rock or some other surface. While it may seem strange that Gauguin drew over the violet with black, conservators have conjectured that he may have wished to strengthen the image\u2019s outlines in order to use the sheet to make transfer drawings. The drawing is related to a painting from 1892 entitled Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 38.2 [W 458]), as well as several later works on paper (see fig. 38.3, fig. 38.4, and fig. 38.5).\n\nThe verso (fig. 38.1) of this sheet contains text from Gauguin\u2019s Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline), which he wrote for his eldest daughter, Aline, in late 1893. The Cahier is a small scrapbook containing press clippings, personal anecdotes, and transcriptions of texts on topics such as aesthetics and criticism, alongside sketches and personal anecdotes. The text reads as follows (missing words, which are in the final notebook, are in brackets):\n\n[These meditations are a re]flection of myself. If A[line] / reads them, I believe, she [is al]so / . . . / a savage and will under[stand] me / Will my thoughts be useful to her? What does it matter / I know she loves her father and this is a remembrance / [of the many] passages down which I walk [?] on f[oot] / confronting a million things. [Thank] God / [Aline] has a lofty heart / Besides I believe I have/ faith !! / [to sacr]ifice for them; to create\u2014 Grow and multiply.\n\nUnfortunately, Aline Gauguin died of pneumonia in 1897, at nineteen, and never saw the notebook.  \nHannah Klemm and Nancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin used sketchbooks to record his many observations of daily life in Tahiti. While five of his sketchbooks remain bound, others were taken apart, their sheets removed from their bindings and often cut down into smaller sheets. Tahitian Eve certainly appears to be one of the many sheets that Gauguin removed from his sketchbooks. Not only would he remove the sheets, he would cut them down, trace them onto other sheets of paper and, on occasion, use them as the matrices for transfer drawings that he made later in his life. In the case of this sheet, it is likely that Gauguin himself removed it from a sketchbook and trimmed it. There is no doubt that there is a relationship between this sketch, the large pastel of the same figure that was pricked for transfer, and the 1892 painting derived from it. A further indication of the importance the image held for Gauguin lies in an albumen print of the pastel pasted into page 51 of his Noa Noa manuscript (fig. 38.6). In that photograph the drawing appears in an unfinished state some time after its use as a transfer drawing and before its reworking into the monumental pastel drawing now in Basel. In a manner reminiscent of Gauguin\u2019s trimming of the sketchbook sheet, the photograph shares a similar thin, vertical format, measuring approximately 238 \u00d7 99 mm with rounded corners cut at the top.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 38.7).\n\nA two-tone application of inks is evident throughout the drawing, yet it functions differently in various parts of the composition. In the face and raised arm, light-brown ink is used to locate the features and initially establish the form. Dark brownish-black ink is used in the eyes and eyebrows and to draw the contour of the mouth and proper left side of the face. Elsewhere, primarily in the torso and legs, the brown ink reads more tentatively, much like an underdrawing, and the black ink applied over and adjacent to it is more emphatic and confidently applied. Depending upon where it is located in the drawing, the brown ink is at once subordinate in some areas and in others strongly independent of the brownish-black ink (fig. 38.8).\n\nScientific analysis of the ink using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry has confirmed the presence of chromium, a major component in the manufacture of chrome logwood ink. Bottled chrome logwood inks could be purchased in a variety of tones that ranged from bright purple to reddish mauve, and brownish purple to brownish black, depending upon the amount of metal salts, such as iron, added. Higher metal-salt content would produce darker and blacker inks. The nature of the logwood dye used in the manufacture of the inks would determine the purple hue that could be obtained. However, the inherent instability of chrome logwood inks often results in the complete loss of their purple hues, as has happened in this drawing.\n\nOnly minimal amounts of iron are present here, indicative of an ink formulation that was likely quite purple in tone. Despite the low levels of iron detected, the chromium to iron ratio does vary depending on the intensity of the ink in the analyzed areas. This helps to confirm the presence of two different inks: a pale ink with low levels of chromium and a dark one with higher chromium levels. Early chroniclers of Gauguin\u2019s drawings often referenced a range of colored inks from violette (purple) to bleue (blue) to black. Present-day viewers may find it difficult to imagine what Gauguin\u2019s ink sketches would have looked like as they first emerged from a pen loaded with purple ink. A digital recolorization based on the study of unfaded ink samples provides a hypothetical rendering (fig. 38.9).\n\nThe paper is typical of a type that was often bound into Gauguin\u2019s sketchbooks\u2014poor-quality, thin, moderately sized, machine-made stock conducive to working in inks or with charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. This sheet was hand torn along all four edges, yet its physical characteristics, combined with its unusual size, reveal that it is likely a page removed from a sketchbook.\n\nThe sheet is identical in type to that used for Head of a Tahitian Woman (cat. 36) and Sketch of Maori Woman and Child (cat. 37), pages also thought to have been removed from a sketchbook, probably one dating from Gauguin\u2019s first Tahitian voyage in 1891\u201393. Although the sheets upon which all of the sketches were drawn suffered significant discoloration due to overexposure to light, the sheets of paper are of a similar tone in areas that were protected from light; they have the same surface texture, weight, and wove paper mold characteristics. In them, the paper fibers display the same mesh pattern from the mold and appear evenly dispersed throughout when viewed in transmitted light. Under ultraviolet light the sheets fluoresce dull yellow, indicative of the aged gelatin sizing in the paper. These observations support the notion that Tahitian Eve was once bound in a sketchbook, perhaps the very same sketchbook that contained Head of a Tahitian Woman and Maori Woman and Child.\n\nNumbers inscribed on the verso of Tahitian Eve and Head of a Tahitian Woman, 54 and 59, respectively, appear to have been written in the same hand, possibly that of Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio, in whose collection both sheets are known to have been a part (see Provenance). A fourth sheet, Standing Nude Woman, and a Figure Emerging from a Tree Behind Her in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre (fig. 38.10 [Pickvance 64]) was drawn in graphite on the same type of paper, and is probably another sheet from among this group. Eve is depicted in much the same pose, although slightly more animated, and drawn on a paper that is very similar, if not identical, to Chicago\u2019s Tahitian Eve. The larger Louvre sheet measures 226 \u00d7 216 mm. The Chicago sheet measures 225 mm in the vertical direction. Given these similarities it is likely that the Louvre sheet was also among the many pages removed from one of Gauguin\u2019s 1891/93 Tahitian sketchbooks.\n\n225 \u00d7 73 mm\n\nThe original paper tone was visible along the edges of the sheet that were once protected by a mat. Light exposure darkened the sheet from pale cream to light tan. The inks have degraded and appear embrittled. There are minute losses in the drawn lines, and where the sheet was creased the losses are more profound. Under magnification cracks and these minute losses are clearly visible. In anticipation of this publication, the drawing was conserved to reduce discoloration and even out the tone.\n\nThe drawing is in sound, stable condition. The sheet tone is now even overall.  \nHarriet K.

[W 458]) and to the pastel of the same title in the Kupferstichkabinett, Basel. The verso contains an inscription that is related to the notebook Gauguin wrote for his daughter Aline, Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline) from 1893 (Biblioth\u00e8que de l\u2019Institut National d\u2019Histoire de l\u2019Art, MS 227).

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available the jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nI am grateful to C\u00e9line Daher for her XRF analysis and identification of chrome logwood ink.

To clarify his working practice, the brown and purple inks on forty-two drawings executed by Van Gogh during the period 1878\u201390 were identified using fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS). Chrome logwood ink was identified.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue from the exhibition Gauguin: Aquarelles, Monotypes, Drawings held at the Galerie Marcel Guiot, Paris, from May 15 to June 13, 1942 lists a number of works drawn in pen and purple ink. Chicago\u2019s Maori Woman and Child (cat. 37) is number 55; a second drawing entitled Femme maorie stylis\u00e9e en idole is number 56. The latter is reproduced in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 sa femme et ses amis, ed. Maurice Malingue (B. Grasset, 1946), pl. 22, opposite page 176. In the list of illustrations the work is described as \u201cDessin a la plume, a l\u2019encre violette.\u201d The Art Institute drawing (cat. 37), plate 23, opposite page 177, is entitled Femme maorie stylis\u00e9e et son enfant and listed as \u201cDessin a la plume, a l\u2019encre violette\u201d (\u201cDrawing in pen, in purple ink\u201d).\n\nStanding Nude Woman, and a Figure Emerging from a Tree behind Her (1891/93; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris [Pickvance 64]).\n\nMary Broadway, condition report, treatment record, and photographic documentation, Dec. 2014; Harriet K.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
