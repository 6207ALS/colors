His bribes, paid to Julius Caesar and other Roman generals, opened Egypt to Rome\u2019s ambitions of empire. He was a weak leader, a drunkard, and no match for his Roman allies. At his death he insisted that his son share the rule with his sister, the legendary Queen Cleopatra VII, but she soon disposed of her brother in order to rule alone.</p>\n",
