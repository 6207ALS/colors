    "description": "<p>A pioneer of digital architecture, Los Angeles\u2013based architect Greg Lynn was one of the first to explore computer programming as a vehicle for creative expression. Stranded Sears Tower is one of his seminal projects. Invited to reenvision Chicago\u2019s landmark building for a 1992 exhibition, Lynn separated the nine structural tubes of the Sears Tower into individual strands, reorienting them horizontally along the Chicago River to develop a new fluid architecture. This project is even more significant because it was his last created entirely by hand, he is now known as a promoter of the \u201cpaperless\u201d studio.</p>\n",
