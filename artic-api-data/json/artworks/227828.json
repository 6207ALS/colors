    "description": "<p>Christian Schad was the first early 20th\u2013century modernist to rediscover and work with the photogram. An image made without a camera by placing an object directly on photosensitive paper and exposing the paper to light, the photogram had been known since photography\u2019s beginnings but was newly explored by the avant\u2013garde for the abstract, formal possibilities it afforded. Tristan Tzara, the leader of the Dada art movement, who first owned this work, dubbed these photograms \u201cSchadographs,\u201d a play on both the artist\u2019s name and the shadowy forms he created with household detritus. Here, the lowly materials of dust and shoestring are ennobled, transformed by the action of light.</p>\n<p>The first fine artist to revive the photogram technique after World War I, Christian Schad is also the only one who liberated his images from the factory-made, rectilinear format standard for photographs. The unusual shapes of Schad\u2019s photograms echo the sculptural wood reliefs that he made during the same period.</p>\n",
