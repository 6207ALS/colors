    "description": "<p>Los Angeles-based artist Jonas Wood creates vivid images, where space and everyday life are rendered with compressed perspective in bold graphic hues. This monograph - the first on the artist's work - brings together his most significant paintings and drawings. In doing so, it offers a unique insight into the vast array of his sources, which include family photographs, found imagery, baseball cards, and other people's art, including the ceramics of his wife, the artist Shio Kusaka.</p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Softcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.38 x 9.88 in.</li><li><strong>Pages: </strong>160</li><li><strong>Illustrations:&nbsp; </strong>200</li></ul>",
