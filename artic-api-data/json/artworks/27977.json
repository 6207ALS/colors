    "description": "<p>In his watercolors of rushing streams made in the Austrian Tyrol, Marin denoted hovering mists and the free-flowing movement of water over rocks by adding layers of wet color to stain the paper and then wiping them away, creating soft, ghostly areas of almost subliminal color. He conjured the shape of a shrub by subtracting pigment, perhaps with the handle of his brush, adding touches of blue to draw the eye into the haze. Cementing his reputation as a \u201cmaster of mists,\u201d the Tyrol watercolors earned Marin many new admirers and are still counted among his most important watercolors.</p>\n",
