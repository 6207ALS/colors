    "short_description": "<p>Charles Atlas (American, born 1949) has been a pioneering figure in film and video for over four decades. Atlas has extended the limits of his medium, forging new territory in a far-reaching range of genres, stylistic approaches, and techniques. Throughout his career, the artist has consistently fostered collaborative relationships, working intimately with such artists and performers as Leigh Bowery, Michael Clark, Douglas Dunn, Marina Abramovic, Yvonne Rainer, Mika Tajima/New Humans, and Antony and the Johnsons. Most notably Atlas served as Merce Cunningham's in-house videographer for a decade from the early 1970s through 1983, and their close working relationship continued until Cunningham\u2019s death in 2009.</p>",
