In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 59.1, fig. 59.2, and fig. 59.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see fig. 59.4 [Kornfeld 16]) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nThe ninth image in the Noa Noa suite, Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59.1, cat. 59.2, cat. 59.3, cat. 59.4, cat. 59.5) depicts two nude Tahitian females along a shore. The woman at the left sits partly on the ground and partly on her wrap, a traditional decorated pareu, or cloth. The second figure is about to plunge into the water. At the upper left corner are the trunk and branch of a coastal tree.\n\nThis wood-block print was informed by two paintings from 1892 from which Gauguin selected and combined components to create a new image. He borrowed the seated nude and diagonal composition from Aha oe feii? (What! Are You Jealous?) (fig. 59.5 [W 461]) and the woman plunging into the ocean from Fatata te miti (Near the Sea) (fig. 59.6 [W 463]). Initially, the print included both the seated nude and her foreshortened, reclining companion from Aha oe feii? Subsequently, Gauguin removed the reclining nude, leaving in its stead, to the immediate lower left of the remaining female, a black, rock-like remnant of what once was the recumbent woman\u2019s head. In the painting, the leafy branch of the coastal beach hibiscus tree (see fig. 59.7) extends over the water, creating colorful reflections on its surface. In the print, Gauguin reduced this element to a tree trunk with a single branch seen at the upper left, and he simplified the patterns in the water.\n\nThe pose of the seated nude in Aha oe feii? and in Auti te pape (where it is reversed because of the transfer process) derives, it has been argued, from that of a frontal, kneeling figure in a first-century B.C. relief at the Theater of Dionysus, Athens, of which Gauguin owned a photograph (fig. 59.8).\n\nBefore he began Aha oe feii?, Gauguin included the seated nude in an 1892 watercolor that he later pasted onto page 185 (folio 97R) of his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 59.9). He also drew her in graphite (fig. 59.10). In a preliminary sketch from 1892, the artist concentrated on details of her hands and feet (fig. 59.11 [cat. 32]). The seated female appears as well in a pastoral landscape painting, possibly dating from 1892 (fig. 59.12 [W 574]), as well as in Nave nave moe (Sweet Dreams) (fig. 59.13 [W 512]).\n\nThe sources for the woman plunging into the ocean, which, as mentioned above, features in Near the Sea, can be found in paintings, sculptures, and drawings from the artist\u2019s time in Brittany. In these works, he saw this figure as embodying the tragic folklore figure Ondine (see fig. 59.14, fig. 59.15, fig. 59.16 [W 336], fig. 59.17, fig. 59.18 [W 337], fig. 59.19 [W 338], fig. 59.20 [Gray 75], and fig. 59.21 [Gray 87]). Among these works is a pen-and-ink drawing entitled Aux roches noires (At the Black Rocks) (fig. 59.22). It was reproduced on page 1 of the catalogue (fig. 59.23 [cat. 22]) for an ad hoc exhibition of works by Impressionists and Synthetists organized by Gauguin and members of his circle at the Caf\u00e9 des Arts, run by a Monsieur Volpini, at the 1889 Exposition Universelle on the Champ-de-Mars, Paris.\n\nAt some time, either prior to or after his return to France from Tahiti, Gauguin fashioned a bark-cloth (tapa) portfolio he titled \u201cDocuments Tahiti 1891 1892 1893,\u201d intended to hold miscellaneous visual materials, predominantly preparatory and finished works on paper. He embellished the front cover with a reproduction of Aux roches noires, which he cut out of a copy of the Volpini catalogue (fig. 59.24). For this exhibition, Gauguin fashioned a suite of zincographs on bright-yellow paper (see cats. 11\u201323), images that include themes and motifs from works in various media that he had executed around 1887\u201388. Among these is Breton Bathers (fig. 59.25 [cat. 13]), which includes, in the upper-left corner, the swimmer diving into waves.\n\nElements of Aha oe feii? appear in two 1894 watercolor transfer monotypes (fig. 59.26 and fig. 59.27 [cat. 65]), both entitled What! Are You Jealous? They have a one-to-one relationship to each other and to the Auti te pape wood-block print (see fig. 59.28), which suggests that Gauguin used one of these monotypes as a matrix for the print.\n\nOn the verso of fig. 59.27 is a fragment (fig. 59.29) of a three-color lithograph, Milliners (fig. 59.30), by the French printmaker Hermann Paul. Milliners was issued as part of a quarterly offering (April\u2013June 1894) from L\u2019estampe originale, an enterprise whose goal was to support contemporary graphic art by publishing original prints for its subscribers. The April\u2013June 1894 portfolio included Gauguin\u2019s lithograph Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (see cat. 73.1). As a contributor, he most likely would have received L\u2019estampe\u2019s entire offering for that quarter. This included the Paul print, which Gauguin apparently did not appreciate, given that he recycled it to print the Art Institute\u2019s monotype Aha oe feii? (cat. 65). The date of the portfolio establishes that Gauguin might have executed the wood-block print sometime between April and June.\n\nGauguin\u2019s fondness for the seated nude in Aha oe feii? is evident from the several instances in which he integrated the motif into varied narrative contexts and settings in paintings he executed toward the end of his life (see fig. 59.31 [W 579] and fig. 59.32 [W 596]). One example, closely related in pose to the figure\u2019s counterpart in Aha oe feii?, appears at the right of a transfer drawing of two females (fig. 59.33 [Field 1973 42]). For this sheet, the artist traced an earlier work (fig. 59.10), and the transfer process reversed the image.\n\nA wood-block print dating to 1898/99 demonstrates that the image of a woman crashing into waves continued to interest Gauguin a decade after he had explored the Ondine theme while in Brittany. At the Black Rocks\u2014Memory of Brittany (fig. 59.34 [cat. 91.2]) is a direct visual quote, although reversed, of the drawing featured on the first page of the 1889 Volpini exhibition catalogue (fig. 59.22 and fig. 59.23). At some point, Gauguin pasted an impression of Aux roches noirs between two other prints on page 186 (folio 97V) of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 59.35).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">As in Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51), Te atua (The God) (cat. 53), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56), Gauguin left an uncarved border all around Auti te pape. A device he had employed in polychrome reliefs such as Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (Be in Love and You Will Be Happy) (fig. 59.36 [Gray 76]), it enhances the solidity of the wood block and the cohesion of the composition. It also emphasizes the materiality of the image, underscored further by the extensive printing of the gouge scoops in the light areas. Ha\u2018uti means \u201cto annoy, disturb by restless doings\u201d and can be used adjectively, while pape refers to \u201cfresh water,\u201d a river, or the juice of anything. Bengt Danielsson observed about this title that, due to the absence of connecting particles, it is \u201cimpossible to know with certitude which word is the subject and which is the direct object\u201d and proposed to translate it either as \u201cThe fresh water is in motion\u201d or as \u201cPlaying in the fresh water.\u201d The intentional ambiguity about agency is typical of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian titles (see cat. 55, Commentary, and cat. 60, Commentary), but \u201cplaying\u201d does not do justice to the basic sense of \u201cannoying,\u201d an action that may be performed in the print by the woman on the right or by the water.\n\nBathing features as a main activity of Tahitian girls in the 1879 novel Le mariage de Loti, the \u201cPolynesian idyll\u201d by Pierre Loti (Julien Viaud). Its narrator describes his young lover, Rarahu, and her friend Tiahoui as \u201ca pair of careless, laughing little beings, living almost entirely in the waters of their brook where they leaped and sported like a couple of flying fish.\u201d Gauguin also wrote about bathing several times in his Noa Noa text, starting with the first chapter, in which he mentioned the vahines participating in King Pomare\u2019s funeral procession taking advantage of the Fatana river for cooling their knees and \u201ccleansing their thighs of the soiling dust from the road.\u201d In the summer of 1892, Gauguin undertook five paintings of bathing women, two of which are combined and modified in Auti te pape. The wood-block print repeats the seated woman, leaning tree, ascending ground, and triangular area of highly reflective water of the 1892 painting Aha oe feii? (What! Are You Jealous?) (fig. 59.37 [W 461]), extending them horizontally. At the right of the print, the sinuous branch and foliage of the tree are replaced by a dark background, against which Gauguin inserted the figure of the woman about to plunge into the water; she derives from another canvas, Fatata te miti (Near the Sea) (fig. 59.38 [W 463]). Close examinations of the print and its matrix revealed that the artist had first thought of including the recumbent figure from Aha oe feii? and then changed his mind, deleting her face and torso by means of cross-hatching but leaving visible a fragment of head and hair that one may (mis)take for a stone and dried leaf (see fig. 59.39; see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 28). The seated woman\u2019s pareu, spread beneath her knee, retains the same curious outline and semicircular ornamental motif in the various avatars of this figure (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works).\n\nThe catalogue of Gauguin\u2019s 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel, Paris, where the two paintings were shown but did not sell, translated Aha oe feii? as Eh quoi! Tu es jalouse (What! Are You Jealous?). The blatant lack of communication between the two women\u00ad\u2014habitual among the human protagonists of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian works\u2014is therefore presented as resulting from a psychological estrangement between them. Yet Charles Stuckey perceptively observed that the seated one \u201cturns her eye to peer out of the picture, as if she were aware of an intruder.\u201d In Auti te pape, this tension is expressed in the physical distance between the two figures, made more emphatic by the fact that they face in opposite directions.\n\nThe new, more effective contrast builds upon a theme that Gauguin had been developing since his 1887 painting Two Bathers (fig. 59.40 [W 215; W 2002 241]). This Breton composition features two nude women, on the left an older, \u201copulent\u201d figure entering the water, and on the right a younger, androgynous-looking one who hesitates to follow the example of her companion. Several clues, including the detail of a pig descending toward the water, suggest that the scene was meant to be allegorical; accordingly, commentators have seen the act of bathing here as a \u201cmetaphor of carnal sin\u201d and of the biblical Fall (see cat. 56, Commentary) and have interpreted the contrast between the two figures as that of \u201cthe woman who gives herself\u201d and \u201cthe one who suffers from having done so.\u201d As this theme developed over several years and many works, Gauguin replaced the woman entering the water with one plunging into the ocean, \u201cperhaps suggesting sexual arousal or erotic freedom,\u201d and she became connected to the tragic folklore figure of the sea nymph Ondine (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). An odd but recurring aspect of this motif is the absence of one hand, which appears to be hidden by the woman\u2019s profile. However, when she is represented in relief, the impression is created of her hand being devoured by her mouth\u00ad\u2014perhaps in reference to the French expression s\u2019en mordre les doigts (literally \u201cto bite one\u2019s fingers\u201d), meaning \u201cto regret.\u201d In Fatata te miti, the Ondine figure extends her forearms parallel to her body, but her left hand disappears behind a strange knot of the large tree, capped by a horn-like branch, as if a fantastic animal were grabbing it. Indeed, the situation clearly recalls the way in which Gauguin, representing himself as \u201ca monster,\u201d seizes the hand of a nude female woman in the relief Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses. This may explain in part why, for no visible reason, the Ondine of Auti te pape lacks a right hand (see fig. 59.41).\n\nIn the 1889 drawing Aux roches noires (At the Black Rocks) (fig. 59.42), the reluctant figure\u2019s posture recalls that of a Peruvian mummy, with which Gauguin was much taken, in the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro, Paris (fig. 59.43). This gave her contrast with the Ondine figure a broader, dualistic significance, more forcefully expressed chromatically, compositionally, and verbally in a painting of the same year entitled Life and Death (fig. 59.44 [W 335]). Something of the same diagrammatic quality is present in Auti te pape in the grand diagonal separating the seated woman from Ondine and the terra firma from the water, and thanks to the yin-yang complementarity of the dark figure on light ground and the light figure on dark ground. The posture of the seated woman in Auti te pape is generally assumed to derive from a Late Classical male Atlantean statue, of which Gauguin possessed a photograph (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 59.8), but the artist may also have taken a more logical inspiration from the widespread Hellenistic pose of the crouching Aphrodite/Venus, representing the goddess of love at her sacred bath (see fig. 59.45). It is a more complex pose than the mummy\u2019s, subtly combining openness and enclosure. The sensuality of the woman\u2019s body is also obvious from the way Gauguin suggested its three-dimensionality, scratching on the wood block an exceptionally dense network of fine lines that, however, tends to remain invisible in his own impressions (see cat. 59.2). Nonetheless, the basic opposition of her static pose to that of the Ondine figure remains valid, leading Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers to interpret her as \u201cturning her back on a joyous bathing scene,\u201d a \u201clonely figure\u201d that \u201cseems to embody a life-negating bitterness.\u201d\n\nBut is this bathing scene\u2014reduced to the equally lonely Ondine, since the fisherman, wearing a red pareu and carrying a harpoon, at the top of Fatata te miti has disappeared\u2014entirely \u201cjoyous\u201d? The woman\u2019s extended arms, which leave her body defenseless, can be understood as expressing surprise and fear, to which the missing hand adds a further unsettling note. Her head is turned to the right, where reflections form strange patterns in the water. These shapes are a simplified chiaroscuro version of their multicolored equivalents in Aha oe feii?, which, according to Zegers, represent reflections of \u201cthe leafy branch of the coastal beach hibiscus tree\u201d (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 59.42). Henri Dorra viewed the reflections in the painting as \u201can incongruous black arabesque\u2014turning into a malevolent lizard-inspired monster of Gauguin\u2019s invention,\u201d which he interpreted as \u201can intriguing cryptogram of jealousy.\u201d He found a confirmation of his perception in Auti te pape, where the plunging woman\u2019s demeanor appeared to him justified by what she sees: \u201cTwo black forms in the water evoke fear itself: a malevolent dolphin\u2019s head and a disquieting skeletal human face that emits an eerie glow through irregular white openings for the eyes and mouth.\u201d\n\nThe identification and interpretation of these fantastic creatures is open to debate, but their intended presence is beyond doubt, given the fact that Gauguin explicitly praised visual ambiguity and included potential images in many other works. In comparison with Aha oe feii?, Auti te pape makes this presence more obvious, as a look at the wood block (fig. 59.46) confirms: Gauguin clarified the outlines of the \u201chead\u201d and \u201cface\u201d and moved the white shapes so as to make them appear more obviously as eyes and mouth(s). It is possible to trace the genealogy of these suggestive reflections, even though it is less straightforward than the origin of the two bathers. In his 1888 painting Washerwomen (fig. 59.47 [W 303, W 2002 325]), an embryonic face appears horizontally in the water at the level of the standing woman\u2019s face, above the lower torso of the woman squatting over a washboard. In the zincographic version of the same composition that Gauguin included the following year in the Volpini Suite (fig. 59.48 [cat. 20]), two dark areas situated on top of the latter\u2019s head have turned to eyes, and a large, monstrous face seems to be coalescing at the surface of the water.\n\nThese inchoate physiognomies are the direct antecedents of the two faces in Aha oe feii? and Auti te pape, and they help to identify other compositional and thematic similarities between the images of French washerwomen and Tahitian bathers. But how should their presence be understood in the latter, and especially in Auti te pape? The title of the wood-block print gains added relevance from them, since it attributes agency to the water and suggests that its restless movement is disturbing\u2014indeed uncanny. The direction of the seated woman\u2019s gaze, \u201cpeering out of the picture,\u201d as Stuckey observed, can also be related to the liquid faces behind her. The ontological status of these suggestions is by definition problematic, and they can be understood to exist \u201conly in the imagination\u201d of the bathers, to paraphrase what Gauguin wrote about Jacob and the Angel in his Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 59.49). Stuckey wrote about the phantasmagoric water in Aha oe feii?: \u201cThe structure of reality dissolves in the rippling shapes of shadows and reflections on the surface of the water, an emblem for the reverie sustained by the Tahitian paradise.\u201d\n\nA sense of threat, however, lurks in this \u201cparadise.\u201d One can relate the embryonic faces to the ti\u2018is of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (fig. 59.50)\u2014\u201cspirits inferior to the gods\u201d and sometimes \u201cguardians of all that is in the sea\u201d (see cat. 54, Commentary)\u2014and interpret them as manifesting the resilience of the Polynesians\u2019 pre-Christian worldview. But one might also understand their latent presence as an indirect, displaced manifestation of the predatory, male element that is part of the Ondine narrative. Thus, in Auti te pape, Gauguin could have replaced the fisherman in Fatata te miti with the \u201cannoying\u201d faces, and it may be relevant that in Tahitian pape means \u201csperm\u201d when associated with t\u0101ne (man). These two interpretations of the liquid faces are not mutually exclusive, and they must probably remain hypothetical: like visual ambiguity, polysemy belongs to the art of Gauguin, who intended his viewers to be active participants in his work, to wonder how much they see and how much they imagine.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This was printed by Louis Roy in spring\u2013summer 1894 as part of an edition of about 25\u201330 impressions.\n\nThis was printed by Louis Roy in spring\u2013summer 1894 as part of an edition of about 25\u201330 impressions.\n\nIn the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

Colta Ives identified the man at the lower left of fig. 59.2 as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten wood-block prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends).

Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the woodcuts do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.
