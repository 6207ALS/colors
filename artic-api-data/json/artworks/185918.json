    "description": "<p>Painter and printmaker Raoul Dufy was also a skilled textile designer. He established a clothprinting workshop in 1910 and designed textiles for the fabric firm Bianchini-F\u00e9rier until 1928. Dufy was mesmerized by the racetrack, where the fashion, speed, and members of high society intermingled with jockeys and horses, all of which are visible in this drawing. That this design is painted in only a few colors indicates that it may have been intended for one of his textile patterns.</p>\n",
