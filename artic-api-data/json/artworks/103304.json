    "description": "<p>Found in women\u2019s graves, bronze mirrors were luxurious personal possessions used in life and then buried with the dead for use in the afterlife. One side was highly polished; the other side was usually engraved with a mythic scene, such as this one, which shows the goddess Eos carrying the body of her son, Memnon, who was killed by the hero Achilles. The episode was taken from Homer\u2019s The Iliad, the epic poem that narrates the Greek siege and eventual defeat of the city of Troy.</p>\n",
