    "description": "<p>Internationally renowned architect Greg Lynn interpreted his version of classical upholstered furniture with his Ravioli chair. Known as a pioneer in the field of digital architecture, Lynn applied the same working methods and processes to expand his work into the field of industrial design, with the belief that the tools and techniques of architectural production can be translated into the design of products. Utilizing digital software, he manipulated the form of a flat square to create volume and mass to develop a piece of furniture. The fiberglass-reinforced construction of the chair is comprised of two shells with a curving perimeter designed to interlock with an ottoman. When used en masse, the chairs make a continuous undulating plane. The bulbous massing that forms the chair is highlighted by the color variations on the surface of the chair\u2019s upholstery.</p>\n",
