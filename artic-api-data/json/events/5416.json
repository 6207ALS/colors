Raised in Chicago, Hunt graduated from the School of the Art Institute in 1957, and in 1958 his work&nbsp;<em>Hero Construction</em>&nbsp;was acquired by the museum. Today that work is prominently displayed on the Woman\u2019s Board Grand Staircase. Over 150 of Hunt\u2019s public sculptures can be found throughout the United States and abroad, but his studio practice remains firmly grounded in Chicago. Working out of a repurposed Chicago Railway Systems electrical substation built in 1909, he has space to be able&nbsp;to continuously create both towering sculptures and more intimate constructions. Hunt's sculptures were recently featured in the Art Institute exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/9531/richard-hunt-scholar-s-rock-or-stone-of-hope-or-love-of-bronze\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Richard Hunt: Scholar\u2019s Rock or Stone of Hope or Love of Bronze</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Event Ticketing and Information</strong></p><p>Individual tickets are now on sale for $175.
