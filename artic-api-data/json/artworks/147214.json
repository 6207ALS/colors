He fell beneath this small tree and died two hours later during surgery. His assailant, Michael Griffin, immediately surrendered to police. He was found guilty of first-degree murder in March 1994 and sentenced to life in prison. \n\nFour months later, at another Pensacola clinic, Paul Hill, the leader of an anti-abortion group called Defensive Action, shot and killed another doctor and his escort.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
