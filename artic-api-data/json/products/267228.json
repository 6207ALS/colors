    "description": "<p>Henri Matisse created some of his most exquisite works by cutting shapes out of paper. Delightfully entertaining and playfully inventive, his \u201cdrawings with scissors\u201d are also a superb introduction to the most basic artistic concepts: color, line, and form. This engaging and accessible look at Matisse\u2019s cut-outs, arguably the highlight of his magnificent career, follows the artist as he goes in search of pure forms of expression. Illustrated with beautiful reproductions of Matisse\u2019s most famous works, the book relates an imaginary tale about how the colors and shapes created by Matisse come to life, carrying the reader off into the artist\u2019s fantasy world. It reflects Matisse\u2019s spontaneity, his love of bold colors, and his seemingly effortless ability to capture movement on paper, which make him an artist of great appeal to children. Fun and easy to follow, this exploration of Matisse\u2019s cut-outs invites children of all ages to draw with scissors just like the artist, using the sheets of paper printed in Matisse-inspired colors included in the book.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Softcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.5 x 0.19 x 11.06 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 40</li>\n<li><strong>Middle Grade (8-12)</strong></li>\n</ul>",
