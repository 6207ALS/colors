    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This magnificent wine cistern or cooler was made in Italy in the mid-16th century. It would have been filled with ice and bottles during banquets. The cistern is an elaborate and splendid example of majolica or Italian tin glazed earthenware pottery. Its exterior design, based on a celebrated Renaissance mural in the Vatican, shows a Roman battle. The interior of the cistern, meanwhile, is a witty pun on its function. It shows an epic naval disaster in which Juno, queen of the gods in Roman mythology, sunk the Trojan fleet aiming to prevent Trojan hero Aeneas form reaching Rome. So as the ice inside the wine cooler melted around the wine bottles, you would look through it to see the sinking Trojan fleet, how underwater. Notice the patterns running around the rim and foot of the cistern. These were inspired by classical decoration. So the cistern is a good example of the way in which Renaissance artists and designers turn back to antique art for inspiration but then create something totally new from it.</p>\n",
