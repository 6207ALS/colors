    "description": "Building Chicago presents the best of this country\u2019s first city of architecture. Colloquially known as America\u2019s \"second city,\" Chicago is widely regarded as this country\u2019s crown jewel when it comes to architecture. The roster of masters who have helped shape its skyline and streetscape stands as a who\u2019s who of the architectural pantheon from the last two hundred years, from Louis Sullivan, Daniel Burnham, and Frank Lloyd Wright to Mies van der Rohe and Frank Gehry. Lavishly illustrated, this volume compellingly displays the masterworks of Chicago architecture\u2014from the Chicago Tribune Tower (1925) and the Rookery (1888) by Burnham &amp; Root to the Trump International Hotel and Tower (2008) by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and the residential skyscraper Aqua (2009) by Jeanne Gang. It features the city\u2019s beloved masterpieces by Wright, including the Robie House, such milestones as the Willis Tower and the John Hancock Building, Gehry\u2019s Pritzker Bandshell, as well as a wealth of little-known treasures from Chicago\u2019s early days culled from the vast collection of the Chicago History Museum.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.38 x 11.31 x 1.5 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 304</li></ul>",
