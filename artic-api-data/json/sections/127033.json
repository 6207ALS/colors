    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">The body of the man who makes a suspect offering to Saint Anthony in folio 7C/D continues into this sheet. The long robe that covers his kneeling legs bears the inscription VIVE LE ST JULIEN ST \u00c9MILION (Long live Saint Julien and Saint \u00c9milion). Saint Julian, also known as Julian the Hospitaller, was the patron saint of travel and the city of Ghent, while Saint \u00c9milion was a Breton monk and hermit who settled in France in the eighth century. Ensor\u2019s reference to these saints, known for their austerity and rejection of the material world, renders the man\u2019s offering doubly disrespectful. The reference to Julian could also allude to Gustave Flaubert\u2019s short story \u201cThe Legend of Saint Julian the Hospitable\u201d (1877). This sheet also contains several fish that resemble those illustrated in contemporary scientific texts. The one at the bottom is a herring (see fig. 1).\n\nAn unusual medium, possibly oil-based, was used to create the pocket in Saint Anthony\u2019s robe at upper right; it stands out from the rest of the folio. As is often the case in this region of the composition, sewing holes are evident along the center fold, and there are pinholes in the top corners. This suggests Ensor may have executed a group of sheets together before mounting them to the canvas. SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 Illustration of herring, published in G.
