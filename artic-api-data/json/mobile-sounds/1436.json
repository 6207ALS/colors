    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Athens under the Roman Empire remained a center for sculpture in the Greek classical style. This Athenian relief from the mid third century A.D. was part of a stone sarcophagus. The carved scene alludes to a tragic theme of youth cut down in its prime. The standing nude male in the center is the hero Meleager resting his foot on a rock. With him are his companions on the hunt for the Caledonian boar an event that led indirectly to the death of Meleager. On the left sits Heracles with his club. A seated female figure on the right whose head has been lost represents Atalanta, the only woman in the hunting party. Notice Meleager\u2019s head with its mane of curls. This resembles several portraits of Alexander the Great. The sculptor may have based this image on a contemporary painting that equated the heroic life and untimely death of Meleager with Alexander\u2019s conquests and death in 323 B.C. Both Meleager and Alexander were believed to have died by decree of the Fates. To hear the story of Meleager now, press the green play button.</p>\n",
