    "description": "<p>Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova dominated Rome\u2019s artistic scene at the turn of the 19th century. This plaster is a partial model for his large-scale marble statue <em>Perseus Holding the Head of Medusa</em>. According to Greek mythology, Medusa was a serpent-haired creature called a Gorgon whose gaze turned anyone who beheld her into stone. Perseus killed Medusa as she slept by using a mirrored shield to approach her and sever her head, which he continued to carry as a weapon, using it to petrify his enemies. Here, Canova depicted Medusa\u2019s decapitated head, with its blank eyes, slack mouth, and cheeks caressed by snakes.</p>\n",
