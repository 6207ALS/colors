    "description": "<p><span>Change up your accessory game. Inspired by the work of pop art icon Andy Warhol (American, 1928 - 1987), our 100% silk wrap is the bold solution to your wardrobe woes.\u00a0\u00a0The image is based on a photograph by artist Karen Bystedt, taken during Warhol's time at Interview magazine. Bystedt invited contemporary street artists to interpret her images in their own artistic language, co-creating mixed media artwork, thus conceptualizing a series of collaborations that would pay homage to the mixed media form so inextricably associated with the legacy of Warhol.</span></p><p><span>Silk scarf:\u00a0 31 in. x 51 in.</span></p>",
