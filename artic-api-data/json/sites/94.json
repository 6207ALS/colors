    "title": "Building: Inside Studio Gang Architects",
    "description": "Inventive. Collaborative. Research-driven. Led by principal and founder Jeanne Gang, Chicago-based Studio Gang Architects has established itself as one of the premier architectural firms working today. Inside Studio Gang Architects presents an engaging workshop-like environment that showcases and reveals the practice's creative process as they seek architectural solutions to pressing contemporary issues. During the course of this exhibition, two Archi-Salons will engage a host of architects, journalists, and critics in discourse surrounding the contemporary practice of architecture. Held within the gallery space, the two salons will focus on different perspectives that influence current practices. These conversations will be inspired by Studio Gang\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s work, but ultimately will address larger issues in the field of contemporary architecture.",
