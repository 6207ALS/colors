    "description": "<p>English sculptor Henry Moore was already well respected in modern art circles when, in 1940, art historian Kenneth Clark asked him to become an Official War Artist to document Britain\u2019s efforts in World War II. At first Moore refused; however, soon after he himself had to hide in an underground subway tunnel during a German bombing raid, he accepted Clark\u2019s offer. Moore\u2019s first government assignment was to capture graphically the fear, pain, and anguish he witnessed in the tunnels, resulting in a powerful series of bomb-shelter drawings.</p>\n<p>By the end of summer 1941, Moore\u2019s interest in producing shelter drawings had waned, and his friend Herbert Read, a philosopher and writer, suggested he depict coal miners who, because their work was crucial to the war effort, were called \u201cBritain\u2019s Underground Army.\u201d The son of a miner, Moore felt an immediate connection to this new subject, and he returned to his hometown, Castleford, to begin the series. Years later he described the brutality of mining conditions: \u201cIf one were to describe what Hell might be like, this would do.\u201d After completing one sketchbook in the mine, Moore returned to his studio, where he filled two additional notebooks with images of miners; the Art Institute\u2019s drawings were removed from one such book.</p>\n<p>Moore\u2019s concentration on miners allowed him to focus on two themes he had not yet explored : men and the figure in motion. Previously, he had depicted principally women and children and the figure at rest. This shift is illustrated in this sketch; constricted to narrow, low tunnels, ranged one above the other, miners walk, bend, and use picks and shovels. Though his figures are not static, Moore acknowledged that their actions were so constrained by the space so that they could use only the top half of their bodies: \u201cthe lower part is stuck [to the floor of the mine] as it were to the pedestal.\u201d</p>\n",
