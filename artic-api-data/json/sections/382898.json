The Whistlers had moved into an upper suite at the elegant Savoy Hotel in early February, and there, staying near his wife\u2019s bedside, the artist recorded the magnificent view of the Thames in a series of lithographs (cat. 154, cat. 155, cat. 156, cat. 157, cat. 158, and cat. 161). This portrait and By the Balcony (cat. 160) were drawn toward the end of their stay at the Savoy; they are probably the two images transferred and proved by the Ways on 25 March 1896 (app. II.4).\n\nFrom the titles he gave to these late portraits as well as from his correspondence, it is apparent that Whistler was unable to accept the inevitable outcome of the cancer that Beatrix had battled since the fall of 1894, when her illness was first diagnosed. There is no overt suggestion of sickness in this image, although her frailty and fatigue are apparent in her face and gesture. On March 25, probably the same day this image was proved, Whistler wrote an optimistic letter to New York dealer Edward Kennedy, saying that his wife was \u201creally better.\u201d In that letter he explained that he was sending \u201ca little drawing I did the other day,\u201d and he told Kennedy: \u201cThis is for you\u2014for the Lady has said that you are to have it!\u2014\u2018la belle dame convalescente\u2019\u2014It is perhaps not a bad lithograph\u2014but I shall send others as we go on getting stronger every day.\u201d\n\nWhen T. R. Way sent Whistler a proof copy of the first edition of his catalogue of the lithographs on 1 May 1896, the image was numbered 122 but had no title, only a question mark in parentheses. Way penciled The Siesta in the margin when corrections were made for the final printing of the catalogue. By that time it must have been clear even to the artist that his wife would not recover, and the new title was used in place of \u201cla belle dame convalescente.\u201d Beatrix Whistler died on 10 May 1896.\n\nWhistler was pleased with The Siesta when it was initially transferred and printed. According to T. R. Way, \u201cthere was not the slightest flaw in the transferring to stone, and the first print satisfied him entirely.\u201d Way (1912) recorded that Whistler \u201chad some twenty proofs printed at once,\u201d and, in the second edition (1905) of his catalogue, the printer gave a total number of thirty-one impressions of The Siesta. It is clear, however, that Whistler\u2019s feelings about this image changed after Beatrix\u2019s death. He released very few impressions to dealers and collectors, and there were no proofs in his estate when he died. Perhaps, finding the portrait altogether too painful and personal, he destroyed all the impressions in his possession. Although the stone remained in the artist\u2019s estate, Rosalind Birnie Philip had Goulding erase it without pulling a posthumous edition. Her decision probably reflects Whistler\u2019s own efforts to suppress the image during his lifetime.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream Japanese paper (219 \u00d7 287 mm).
