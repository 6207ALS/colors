What tools make comfort and movement a possibility for our bodyminds? How do our care practices facilitate or limit movement? What conditions and social positions complicate our access to comfort, care, and movement?<br></p><p>*Limited seating is available.</p><h2>About the Dancers</h2><p><strong>Maggie Bridger </strong>(she/her) is a sick and disabled dance artist and scholar.
