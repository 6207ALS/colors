    "description": "<p>This publication focuses on the breakthrough Surrealist years of Ren\u00e9 Magritte (1898\u20131967), creator of some of the 20th century\u2019s most extraordinary images. Bringing nearly 80 paintings, collages, and objects together with a selection of photographs, periodicals, and early commercial work, it offers fresh insight into Magritte\u2019s identity as a modern artist and one of Surrealism\u2019s preeminent painters. Beginning in 1926, when the artist first aimed to create paintings that would, in his words, \u201cchallenge the real world,\u201d and concluding in 1938\u2014a historically and biographically significant moment just before the outbreak of World War II\u2014the authors trace central strategies and themes from this formative period, particularly those of displacement, isolation, transformation, metamorphosis, the \u201cmisnaming\u201d of objects, and the representation of visions seen in half-waking states.</p>\n<p>Edited by Anne Umland, with additional contributions by Stephanie D'Alessandro, Michel Draguet and Claude Goormans, and Josef Helfenstein with Clare Elliott<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Softcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.25 x 11.75 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 256</li>\n</ul>",
