Glass and Eleanor C. Glass, obj. 159846\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Born in Austria, Henry P. Glass embarked on his design career at the age of eighteen when he enrolled at Vienna\u2019s Technische Hochshule to study architecture and design for furniture, interiors, cars, storefronts, posters, exhibits, and displays. Citing the influence of Peter Behrens, R. Buckminster Fuller, Walter Gropius, Adolf Loos, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, and Otto Wagner, he went on to build a career making functional, modern wares celebrated for their innovative design as well as their simplicity, durability, and practicality.\n\nGlass immigrated to the United States in 1939 after being imprisoned for a time at Dachau and Buchenwald. He settled in New York, where he found work in the office of Gilbert Rohde, contributing to furniture designs for Herman Miller and to Rohde\u2019s submissions to the 1939 World\u2019s Fair. It was during this time that Glass recalls discovering his passion for \u201cdesigning things that will be used by innumerable people,\u201d which he carried through in his work for other firms and into the vision of his own company, Henry P. Glass Associates, which he founded in 1945. Indeed, many of his most famous designs\u2014including his Swingline furniture, manufactured by Fleetwood Furniture Company in the 1950s, and his foldable Cricket chair, fabricated by Brown Jordan in the 1970s\u2014were affordable, highly functional mass-produced objects made of economical materials.\n\nGlass was not only a prolific designer but also a teacher and writer, publishing a treatise in 1996 called The Shape of Manmade Things. In it he articulates his tenets for good design, centered on functionality, honesty in materials and methods, and originality. While he often utilized methods of mass production to achieve these ends, the Art Institute\u2019s coffee service is a rare example in his oeuvre that combines a precious metal with handcraftsmanship. Comprising a unique group of objects that Glass had made for his wife by an unknown Mexican silversmith to mark their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, the service reflects the same attention to utility, truth to materials and process, and innovative modern forms that characterize his industrial designs. In a space-efficient use of forms, the sleek, trapezoidal coffeepot, covered cream pot, and covered sugar dish fit compactly onto a serving tray customized for each object\u2014a design approach he also used for the matching butter and salt and pepper shaker set. Subtle hammer marks point to the handwork involved in the realization of each item, while the lids fit comfortably, although not perfectly, atop the tapering bodies. The shape of the coffee service is at once spare and dynamic\u2014emphasizing the bodies of the vessels through wide expanses of metal interrupted by sharp angles. Although not completely symmetrical, the service is balanced according to what Glass termed \u201cdynamic symmetry,\u201d an approach to pleasing compositions and visual excitement achieved by juxtaposing masses, voids, lines, shapes, colors, light, and shadow. According to Glass, the effects of dynamic symmetry could be seen in \u201ceye-catching side views\u201d\u2014just the sorts of angles that he captured in a design drawing for this service (see fig. 101.1).  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom of each (fig. 101.2)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Henry P.

His anti-Nazi activities led to his arrest in 1938, and he spent nine months in concentration camps before his wife, Eleanor, was able to arrange his release with an immigration visa on the condition that he leave the country within three weeks.

For more on the Cricket chair, see Head (2004), p. 80.\n\nGlass (1996).\n\nAccording to AnneKarin Glass, daughter of the designer, Henry Glass decided to have the set made in Taxco, Mexico, because of the city\u2019s reputation for fine silver handwork. Thus far, there is no identification of the maker associated with the M.R.M. hallmark that appears on the set, although the mark\u2019s inclusion of D.F. (Federal District) suggests that it could have also been made in Mexico City.\n\nGlass (1996), p. 26.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Coffee Service, 1962.\n\nfig. 101.1 Henry P. Glass.
