    "description": "<p>Before turning to photography, Aleksandr Rodchenko was best known for the painting and innovative graphic design he made in the early years of Soviet Russia. He was among the pioneers of photomontage, which combined text and bold color with found photographs. His first foray into making photographs was a series of six portraits of the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, whose forceful look he incorporated in book cover designs from 1925 to 1929.</p>\n<p>After Mayakovsky\u2019s death in 1930, Rodchenko was induced to turn several of his photographs into commemorative images for the newly lionized poet. The photograph\u2019s afterlife as a popular icon was far from Rodchenko\u2019s earlier aims, since he argued that the camera captures moments of a life rather than summarizes a person\u2019s character. \u201cCrystallize man not by a single \u2018synthetic\u2019 portrait,\u201d he wrote in 1928, \u201cbut by a whole lot of snapshots taken at different times and in different conditions.\u201d</p>\n",
