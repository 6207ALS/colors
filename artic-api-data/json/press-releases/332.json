This exhibition is the first museum retrospective focused on the extraordinary and underrecognized career of American designer Dan Friedman. The exhibit will feature more than 50 works that showcase Friedman\u2019s unbounded creativity through posters, books, large-scale assemblages, and iconoclastic furniture designs. Drawn primarily from the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this exhibition charts Friedman\u2019s remarkable mid-career transformation from a graphic designer to a multimedia creator whose neon-colored works defy traditional categories. His unconventional style led to diverse collaborations with some of the most prominent artists living in New York City in the early 1980s, including Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Tseng Kwong Chi. Friedman\u2019s career began with training at two prestigious schools for modern design and typography in Europe. He then went on to teach graphic design at Yale University before building his early career in corporate branding for large companies like Citibank. Despite his success, by the late 1970s Friedman became disillusioned with corporate work and immersed himself in the artistic subculture of the East Village. This experience allowed him to explore the full range of his creativity, and begin creating the wild, mixed-media assemblages and customized furniture pieces that became the hallmark of his practice. Friedman\u2019s work blurs the boundaries between art and design, inspired by everyday debris from the streets of New York and diverse references to popular culture, including corporate logos and cartoon characters. Friedman employed found objects and vibrantly painted surfaces to create lyrical, yet irreverent compositions that explore themes ranging from ecological disaster to day dreams. \u201cHe had an absurdist sensibility that oscillated between humor and tragedy,\u201d said Alison Fisher, Harold and Margot Schiff Curator, Architecture and Design, \u201can attitude that allowed him to make space for radical optimism in a materialistic, media-driven world.\u201d During the late 1980s, Friedman became increasingly invested in work addressing the political and social issues of his time, including rapidly evolving technology, environmental pollution, and South African apartheid. The most iconic of these projects\u2014his 1987 Art Against AIDS Poster \u2014was created to help combat the AIDS crisis, a disease that had a devastating impact on Friedman\u2019s artistic community in New York and claimed his own life in 1995. Building on the Art Institute\u2019s early acquisition of Friedman\u2019s work in 1989, this exhibition represents a timely, wide-ranging examination of a major, yet underexplored figure in 20th century design whose unbridled practice speaks to stylistic and political directions in art and design today. Dan Friedman: Stay Radical is curated by Alison Fisher, Harold and Margot Schiff Curator, Architecture and Design, with McKenzie Stupica, COSI Research Fellow in Architecture and Design. ",
