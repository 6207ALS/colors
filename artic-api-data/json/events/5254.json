Northrop and produced by Tiffany Studios, the <em>Hartwell Memorial Window</em> was commissioned in 1917 for the Central Baptist Church in Providence, Rhode Island. Standing over 25 feet high by 18 feet wide, the window depicts lush natural scenery and a distant view of Mount Chocorua in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. A tour-de-force of radiant materials and technical brilliance, the <em>Hartwell Memorial Window</em> is a remarkably naturalistic image of beauty and depth showcasing Tiffany\u2019s range of innovations in glass. Beginning May 29, 2021, it will be on view in the Henry Crown Gallery at the top of the Woman\u2019s Board Grand Staircase. Located near the Michigan Avenue entrance, the window will welcome visitors as they begin their journey through the museum.</p><p>This virtual event will be hosted on Zoom. We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of Zoom to enjoy this program.</p><p>If you have any questions about virtual programming, please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.</p><p>For questions related to accessibility accommodations, please email <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a>.&nbsp;</p>",
