    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The title of this elegant, gossamer-like drawing by Sol LeWitt describes exactly how it was created.  A wall is divided into four horizontal parts.  In the top row are four equal divisions, each with lines in a different direction; in the second row, six double combinations; in the third row, four triple combinations; in the bottom row, all four combinations superimposed.  The artist was inspired by mathematically-derived formulations.  For him they expressed an idea that was the essential kernel of that particular work.  But when his formulations are executed and become tangible artworks, the results are often unexpectedly beautiful.  This drawing, like many of LeWitt's works, was actually made by a team of trained draftsmen.  In a way, its full title is like a musical score that the team performs directly on the museum's wall.  This is the second time that the drawing has been made here since it entered the Art Institute's collection in 1985.  As the piece for the artist is principally about the collaborative expression of an idea, it can be removed from a wall and then remade repeatedly over time.  LeWitt's belief that a concept or idea was the most important part of making art is true as well for many of the other conceptual artists whose work is displayed in this gallery.</p>\n",
