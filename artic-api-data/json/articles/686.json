A new exhibition\u2014drawn primarily from the museum\u2019s collection\u2014takes a look at this turbulent and transformative period through the work of photographers and filmmakers who focused their lenses on the city\u2019s many distinct neighborhoods and communities, capturing them with immense pride, defiance, and nuance.
