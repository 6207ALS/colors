    "description": "<p>Bertrand Goldberg\u2019s design for Marina City (1959-67) had a lasting impact on Chicago urbanism and provided a virtually unrivaled contribution to the cultural imagination of the mid-century world. The novel mixed-use development was designed to produce a microcosm of the urban landscape or, \u201ca City with a City,\u201d with a lively 24-hour cycle of living, work, and play in the apartment towers, commercial areas, office and theater buildings. An expressive sketch of the complex illustrates a variety of geometries from rounded tower \u201cpetals\u201d to a recessed rectangular ice-skating rink. This drawing was created in 1985 when Goldberg was asked to consult on renovations to the plaza level of the complex.</p>\n",
