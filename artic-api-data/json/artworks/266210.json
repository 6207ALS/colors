    "description": "<p>This delicate fruit basket is a rare example of early American porcelain, one of only 20 known surviving works by Gousse Bonnin and George Anthony Morris\u2019s American China Manufactory. Porcelain, a kind of ceramic, originated in China, where its formula was a heavily guarded secret; it eventually emerged as a prized material in global luxury goods because of its luminosity and strength. American manufacturers were slow to develop porcelain wares because of the hazards of the materials and equipment, a lack of skilled craftspeople, and foreign price competition. Even though the American China Manufactory was short-lived, this basket represents the early advancements of this industry in the American colonies.</p>\n",
