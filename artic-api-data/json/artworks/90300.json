    "description": "<p>Jasper Johns began his career in the mid-1950s by re-creating, with great precision, such familiar images as targets, letters, numbers, and flags. Although his subject matter has become less commonplace, he continues to \u201cborrow\u201d from the public domain. <em>Perilous Night</em>, for instance, owes its title to a pivotal and expressive piece of music written by the American composer John Cage (1912\u20131992) in 1945. Both score and cover sheet are rendered on the right-hand side of the drawing with Johns\u2019s characteristically fluid handling of ink. On the sheet\u2019s left side is a freehand rendition\u2014abstracted, reversed, and turned ninety degrees\u2014of a single, terror-stricken soldier from the Resurrection panel of Matthias Gr\u00fcnewald\u2019s sixteenth-century masterwork the Isenheim Altarpiece (Unterlinden Museum, Colmar). Between the soldier and the musical score is a black imprint of Johns\u2019s right arm, evidence perhaps of the creative power that can merge two disparate images into a cogent statement. The overcome soldier witnessing the Resurrection of Christ and a piece of music marking a key transition in a composer\u2019s career both point to \u201cperilous nights\u201d that can change the course of a human life. Characteristically, Johns also explored the same subject in different media. This somberly colored drawing derives from a painting of the same name (1982; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC).</p>\n",
