    "description": "<p>Frank Lloyd Wright had substantial ties to the Art Institute during the first decade of the 20th century when he created the Prairie style\u2014the style that he debuted with the 1910 home in Chicago\u2019s Hyde Park neighborhood, the Robie House. When that structure was slated for demolition in 1957, the Art Institute\u2019s director Daniel Catton Rich was among the city\u2019s leaders who spearheaded the campaign to save it. In this lecture, architectural historian and preservationist Kathryn Smith examines these connections among the architect, the museum, and the seminal structure. She discusses the exhibitions Wright organized and presented at the Art Institute and considers the ways in which these exhibitions articulated his seminal design philosophy and persuaded his detractors.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
