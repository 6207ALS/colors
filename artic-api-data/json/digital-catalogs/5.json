The catalogue focuses on 165 significant objects, many published for the first time, including sculptures in marble, bronze, stucco, and terra-cotta; coins; glass vessels; mosaic panels; cameos; Fayum portraits; and jewelry. Groundbreaking curatorial and conservation entries include new high-resolution photography, stunning 360-degree rotating views of the objects, and in-depth technical imaging and analysis.   Edited by Katharine A. Raff; essays by Katharine A. Raff, Rachel C. Sabino, Lorenzo Lazzarini, Karen Manchester, John Twilley, Theresa Gross-Diaz, Sidney Goldstein, Sandra E. Knudsen, and Nicola Barham.   The volume is free and was made possible thanks to a generous grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. ",
