    "description": "<p>For <em>after Heysen</em>, a depiction of gum trees in the Australian bush, Rosemary Laing engaged her national identity through a reference to the work of famed Australian landscape painter Hans Heysen (1877\u20131968). The photograph\u2019s source is a 1909 drawing by Heysen, <em>Summer</em>, which adapts the French Barbizon vision of the rural idyll to the context of an expanding nation finding its way into the outback\u2014apparently without heed to the path of ecological and cultural destruction that was leading it there. In Laing\u2019s version, nature\u2019s colors are muted, as if the imperialist subtext to Heysen\u2019s drawing has had its effect, draining the real landscape of its life. But Laing should not be taken as only a critical revisionist. Her work shows placidity and quiet belonging, too. It was created during a period of national reconciliation that reached a high point in 2008, when Prime Minister Kevin Rudd offered an apology to Australia\u2019s Aboriginal people for their long mistreatment during the colonial era.</p>\n",
