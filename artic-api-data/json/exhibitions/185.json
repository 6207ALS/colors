    "short_description": "Architecture has been a favored subject of photographers since the invention of the medium in the 19th century. Despite the prevalence of architectural images, their purpose is not always apparent. One persistent problem has been the definition of such works: are they views, deliberately framed by the photographer with artistic intent, or are they commercial endeavors, intended to serve an iconic or illustrative purpose? In 1963 British photographer and author Eric de Mare designed the former type as pictures and the latter as illustrations.",
