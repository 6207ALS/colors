Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nRocky outcroppings pounded by crested, foamy waves of a turbulent ocean\u2014evoking Brittany\u2019s dramatic coastline\u2014set the stage for this scene. A towering black rock serves as a kind of canopy for a despondent, naked woman who supports her head with her hands, her elbows resting on her knees. To the left, another female nude plunges into the roiling waters.\n\nThe composition of this late wood-block print is a close variant, albeit reversed, of a pen-and-ink drawing from 1889 (fig. 91.1). Gauguin apparently thought so highly of the image that he had it reproduced on the first page of the catalogue of the exhibition he helped organize at M. Volpini\u2019s Caf\u00e9 des Arts at the time of the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris (fig. 91.2). Several years later, in Tahiti, he pasted another reproduction of the print onto the tapa cover of the portfolio Documents Tahiti: 1891, 1892, 1893 (fig. 91.3). Gauguin also used a variation of the composition as the background for an 1889/90 portrait of his friend the Dutch artist Meijer de Haan (fig. 91.4 [Rewald 58, Pickvance 41]).\n\nThe motif of the forlorn seated woman can be traced back to a fully dressed figure in Gauguin\u2019s 1888 oil painting The Wine Harvest (Human Misery) (see cat. 95, fig. 95.3 [W 304, W 2002 317]), for which Gauguin looked to a Peruvian mummy that he had sketched at the Mus\u00e9e Ethnographique du Trocad\u00e9ro, Paris, sometime before November 1888 (for the relevant pages in the sketchbook, known as the Album Walter, see cat. 95, figs. 95.7 and 95.8). This figure also recalls Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s acclaimed engraving Melancholia I (cat. 95, fig. 95.9), which would reappear in many images by the artist in 1889, including a sculpture (fig. 91.5 [left, Gray 76]), an oil painting (fig. 91.6 [W 335]), a pastel (fig. 91.7 [W 333]), and a watercolor and pastel (fig. 91.8 [W 334]).\n\nGauguin repeated the melancholy woman in several works contemporary with the present print, including his monumental Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (fig. 91.9 [W 561]). He sketched the composition in a letter dated February 1898 to his friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid (fig. 91.10) and another plate from the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (fig. 91.11 [cat. 105]).\n\nThe seemingly fearless bather relates to the many works Gauguin devoted around the same time to the theme of Ondine, a water nymph whose marriage to a mortal had tragic consequences for both. These include two oil paintings (fig. 91.12 [W 336] and fig. 91.13), two mixed-media paintings (fig. 91.14 [W 337] and fig. 91.15), a fan design (fig. 91.16 [W 338]), a design for a book cabinet (fig. 91.17), a drawing (fig. 91.18), and two relief sculptures (fig. 91.19 [Gray 75] and fig. 91.20 [Gray 87]). Gauguin also included the figure in a painting executed during his first trip to Tahiti (fig. 91.21 [W 463]).\n\nFinally, Gauguin pasted a third-state impression of At the Black Rocks into his bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, on which he worked from 1893 until his death (fig. 91.22).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.
