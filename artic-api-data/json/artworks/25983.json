An inspired practitioner of watercolor, his work focused on the natural world and the effects of industrialization on small-town America. According to Burchfield\u2019s friend Edward Hopper, \u201cThe work of Charles Burchfield is most decidedly founded, not on art, but on life, and the life that he knows and loves best.\u201d The artist kept many sketchbooks and journals; an excerpt from one of these has been linked to <em>Two Fence Posts</em>: \u201cGive effect of light coming from above\u2014blend as mass to lighter &amp; finally have only an outline of mass, which itself thins out toward the light.\u201d</p>\n",
