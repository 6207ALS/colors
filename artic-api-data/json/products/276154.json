    "description": "<p>The most comprehensive study to date of H\u00e9lio Oiticica, one of the world\u2019s foremost practitioners of neo-concretism, who is internationally recognized for his innovative and participatory work.</p><p>In his\u00a0ingeniously constructed works, H\u00e9lio Oiticica revolutionized the idea of interactive art. Accompanying\u00a0the first full US retrospective of the Brazilian artist in over two decades, and the first ever to travel the\u00a0country, this heavily illustrated volume captures the excitement and complexity of Oiticica\u2019s paintings,\u00a0sculptures, and installations. Insightful essays by US and Latin American writers cover the entirety of\u00a0his career, with special emphasis on his little-known New York period between 1971 and 1978.\u00a0</p><p>Thoroughly exploring Oiticica\u2019s most acclaimed works, such as the\u00a0<em>Parangol\u00e9s</em>\u00a0and his groundbreaking installation\u00a0<em>Tropic\u00e1lia</em>, this book also examines his involvement with music, literature, and his response\u00a0to politics and the social environment in Brazil. From his immersion in 1960s counterculture to his life\u00a0and work in New York City and final return to Rio de Janeiro, this catalog charts the development of an utterly original talent whose work is both wide-ranging and thoroughly engaging.</p><p>320 pages with 291 illustrations.</p><p>9\" x 12 1/4\" x 1 1/4\".</p>",
