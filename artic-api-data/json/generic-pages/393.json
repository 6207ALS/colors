Sackler Gallery, the Colby College Museum of Art, and the University of Glasgow\u2014the Art Institute seeks to nurture, produce, and disseminate original scholarship and critical analysis of James McNeill Whistler and his international artistic circles. In addition to the paintings, drawings, and pastels, which will be featured as the subject of this publication, the Art Institute\u2019s collection also includes nearly complete holdings of Whistler\u2019s etchings and lithographs.
