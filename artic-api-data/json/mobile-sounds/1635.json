He and other Renaissance artists were interested in bringing greater realism to their portrayals of the human body, often using classical sculpture as inspiration.  Here Botticelli depicts the whole of the Christ Child's body as he stands on the Virgin's lap.  His arms lovingly encircle his mother's neck, and his rounded face presses closely to the smooth planes of her cheek.  These details convey the three-dimensionality of their bodies, as well as the intimacy of their embrace.&quot;</p>\n",
