    "title": "Rembrandt\u2019s Journey: Painter, Draftsman, Etcher",
    "description": "Rembrandt van Rijn (1606\u20131669) is one of the most celebrated artists in history. With more than 200 works from all periods of his long career\u201420 paintings, 33 drawings, 153 prints, and 7 copper plates taken from major collections here and abroad\u2014this is the first American exhibition to explore Rembrandt\u2019s astonishing range and variety of activity as a brilliant etcher seen in the context of his paintings and drawings. Rembrandt\u2019s Journey highlights the parallel relationships among the master\u2019s paintings, drawings, and prints\u2014closely examining imagery, narrative content, and the marks of the artist\u2019s hand, as well as his approach to religious illustration in all of the media he mastered and reinvented. A closer study of the expressions, gestures, and body language of his figures will provide deeper insight into the inventive, subtle, and complex way he interpreted biblical texts and imaginatively projected himself into them. The exhibition will focus on several of the subjects to which Rembrandt returned\u2014portraits and self-portraits, everyday life, landscape, the nude\u2014at various stages of his career.",
