    "description": "<p>A self-taught photographer from Detroit, Harry Callahan became one of the most respected photographers of the 20th century and mentored a generation of students at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design. He once modestly described his subjects as \u201cnature, buildings, and people,\u201d and his photographs of architecture share a hallmark frontality and simplicity. In this image of an airplane hangar, Callahan masked off part of his 8 \u00d7 10\u2013inch negative to emphasize the building\u2019s horizontal form. The Art Institute purchased this photograph from the photographer a year after granting Callahan his first one-man museum exhibition.</p>\n",
