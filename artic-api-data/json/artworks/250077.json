    "description": "<p>Daguerreotypes\u2014brilliant photographs on metal plates\u2014memorialized families with the first widely affordable images. The technology was especially popular in the 1840s and 1850s, an era of higher mortality rates. Daguerreotypists employed the slogan \u201cSecure the shadow, ere the substance fade\u201d to encourage sitters to visit the photographer\u2019s studio before it was too late. This is one of a rare group of five images that tracks a single family over several years, including a period of mourning. Most of the images focus on the family\u2019s patriarch, Charles Coit, including a photographic portrait, a painted portrait based on that photograph, a daguerreotype copy of that painting, and finally, a daguerreotype of the entire family posing with the painting\u2014as a substitute for the father in a group portrait\u2014made after his untimely death. These family photographs thus invite meditation on mortality and the function of representation. Can a painting stand in for a person? Can a photograph?</p>\n<p>Here, we see a portrait of the youngest son, George Coit; judging from his clothing, this was probably made during the same session as the group portrait (2019.454) after his father's death.</p>\n",
