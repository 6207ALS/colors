Hercules, the hero of Greek myth, is identified by his club, a lion\u2019s hide, and the apple in his right hand. Though lifelike, the figure was not drawn from a live model but rather from statues available to the artist in Rome, especially an ancient Roman<br>sculpture of a reclining river god.</p>\n<p>The blue paper creates a mid tone between the black and white chalks, granting Hercules a greater degree of volume and naturalism and dramatically enhancing Annibale Carracci\u2019s fluid, masterful line.</p>\n",
