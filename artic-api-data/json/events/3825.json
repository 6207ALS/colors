    "description": "<p>>Guitarist Jeff Parker leads his retro-futurist jazz ensemble the New Breed in a performance responding to works of art by Charles White and artists associated with the Chicago Black Renaissance. Parker has been at the foreground of the Chicago music scene as a member of both the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians and the post-rock group Tortoise.</p><p>>Presented with Constellation </p><p>>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago. </p><p>>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event. </p><p> class=\"standard-sand\"><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p>>Jeff Parker is best known as a member of the band Tortoise and has been a prolific pillar of the Chicago jazz and experimental music scene over the past 20+ years.</p><p>>When Parker moved from Chicago to Los Angeles in 2014, he found the opportunity to reopen some home recordings and beat projects that had been dormant on his hard drive for years. By early 2015 Parker had refined several compositional ideas around his samples, and enlisted local friend Paul Bryan to engineer and play bass guitar in sessions with saxophonist Josh Johnson and drummer Jamire Williams. The recordings were conducted to capture composed passages as well as free playing that used Parker\u2019s beats and sample suites as improvisational criterion. Parker named the project the New Breed, after a clothing store his late father Ernie owned and operated in the 1970s, and finished the album by stitching the band tracks together with intermittent pieces of beat memories from his archive.</p><p>>The final presentation is a retrospective tapestry that explores Parker\u2019s past both musically and patrilineally, as a potent compositional tribute to his influences and a collaboration with his kin held together by clippings from the family photo album. The New Breed is Parker\u2019s most vibrant and comprehensively personal work yet, appropriately the first in 11 years with only his name in the lead artist column.</p>",
