The Dead Christ with Angels (fig. 6.1)\u2014shown at the Salon of 1864, a year before the exhibition of Jesus Mocked\u2014was based on Andrea del Sarto\u2019s frescoed image Christ as the Man of Sorrows (c. 1525; fig. 6.2). Manet had seen the work in Florence and recorded it in one of many drawings after this artist, whose works evidently enchanted him. The encounter with Sarto\u2019s works appears to have freed up Manet\u2019s approach to the human figure, which thereafter became more direct and natural, particularly in the expression of emotion, including religious emotion. His visionary evocation of the dead Christ with angels in the tomb drew on traditional representations of the theme. But it was essentially inspired by Sarto\u2019s representation of the lonely figure in the cave, to which he added the angels from the New Testament story.\n\nThe painting is a masterly combination of real and unreal elements, with Christ\u2019s dead body presented in a richer, more accomplished Italian Renaissance-like mode than the starker, more Northern realism of his Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers. Manet himself captured the visionary yet natural manner of his Italianate scene (see fig. 6.1) in an impressive and very original print interpretation. Using a large copperplate (cat. 7), the peintre-graveur (artist-printmaker) prepared his etching in a traditional way. A drawing in graphite, overworked with a rich mixture of techniques\u2014watercolor and gouache, pen and India ink\u2014that Manet gave to \u00c9mile Zola has previously been hailed as documenting the artist\u2019s recognition that he had erred in his painting by placing Christ\u2019s wound on the wrong side (fig. 6.3). But if Manet wished his print to show the image as he had painted it, he had to reverse the drawing he intended to trace, so that a print taken from the copperplate would appear in the same orientation as the painted canvas. It is not known whether he did in fact use a tracing from a lost drawing of his Salon composition as the basis for the print. All one can say with certainty is that a tracing taken from the print fits exactly with the drawing, which itself shows no signs of indentation, and was made on strong laid paper with a watermark that relates it both to other drawings for his major, early paintings and to his use of indirect tracing methods (see cat. 1).\n\nIn the first known state of the print (fig. 6.4), the plate was etched with fine, clear, parallel lines, and the image was then \u201cwashed\u201d with very fine-grained aquatint in two tones: one just strong enough to produce brilliant highlights on and around the body of Christ from the pure white chine paper on which the image was printed; and the second graduated to create mysterious, luminous effects in the roof of the tomb, which shade to ink-black shadows that throw the figures into dramatic relief. The three surviving proofs are of unearthly beauty. Their print technique recalls the etching style and aquatint effects in some of Francisco de Goya\u2019s later Tauromaquia prints, a fine first edition set of which was acquired for the Biblioth\u00e8que imp\u00e9riale in November 1856. Two years later, after Manet\u2019s visit to Italy, he would be granted access to the print study room, where he could learn from these masterful examples of printmaking.\n\nThe second state of the plate, represented in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, is entirely different. Heavily re-etched (see cat. 7), the print is still impressive. The loss of its visual clarity and mystical luminosity has transformed it into a very different work. The re-etching may have been prompted by the fragility of the initial, light etching and extremely fine aquatint, and/or by the desire to print an edition, perhaps with the help of F\u00e9lix Bracquemond as early as the 1860s, or with Henri Gu\u00e9rard in the 1870s. The print is not known to have been exhibited in Manet\u2019s lifetime, but it was mounted with two other etchings for the 1884 memorial exhibition and auction sale that followed it (see fig. 6.5).  \nJuliet Wilson-Bareau\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Dead Christ with Angels is identified as a late print from a plate also in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection (cat. 7). The main processes Manet used in the plate are etching and aquatint. For this impression, the printer inked the plate with a heavy hand, utilized retroussage to improve contrast, and printed the image on a laid paper with an Arches watermark.\n\nBlack etching ink (visual estimation).\n\nThe printer used an Arches paper. The Arches watermark (fig. 6.6) is visible in the center of the sheet and readable from the verso. The watermark measures approximately 14 \u00d7 121 mm.\n\nThe support is a moderately textured and moderately thick laid paper produced on a double-faced mold. Its color is between cream and beige. The chain lines are vertical and fall at intervals between 28 and 29 mm, and the laid lines are consistently 9 per centimeter. The presence of a strong horizontal grain and uniform thickness indicates that the paper was produced by machine. Fiber content appears to be consistent throughout the sheet and, except for a few stray fibers, is beaten to an equal degree. Deckles are present on the top, right, and bottom edges.\n\nSheet: 542 \u00d7 365 mm, deckle on the top, right, and bottom edges  \nPlate: 395 \u00d7 324 mm  \nImage: 328 \u00d7 277 mm\n\nInscribed: 42213 (in the upper right corner, in graphite).\n\nThis impression of Dead Christ with Angels is richly inked, with a printed ink film on the plate borders and bevel. Compared with the impression in the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., (fig. 6.7 [Harris 51, state 3]), the inking on the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s print (fig. 6.8) exhibits less manipulated plate tone (the thin layer of ink left on a plate and often worked by the artist or printer to create enhanced tonal effects). In the Washington print, the highlights in Christ\u2019s halo; the angel\u2019s wings; portions of the angel\u2019s drapery; and Christ\u2019s torso, arms, and legs are very white, suggesting that plate tone was removed from these areas. The Washington impression also includes a gradation of tone behind the angels, suggesting that this area was carefully wiped by the printer, presumably Henri-Charles Gu\u00e9rard.\n\nIn the Chicago impression, Christ\u2019s torso, arms, and legs and the surrounding drapery appear to be relatively cleanly wiped in comparison to the remainder of the plate. On the whole, the printer appears not to have used wiping to remove printing ink; he does, however, seem to have employed retroussage, which emphasizes darks. A period source describes this manipulation of the ink: \u201cafter the plate has been inked and wiped clean, it is gone over with a piece of very soft muslin, and a certain amount of ink is thus brought up out of the lines, which gives printing a soft tint around each line.\u201d\n\nThe uneven plate tone in the borders of the print and the printed evidence of scratches in the image attest to the printer\u2019s use of retroussage. At upper left, the wiping moves downward in a right-to-left diagonal and picks up ink from the etched lines. The left edge, from center downward, seems to have been wiped with a downward motion (fig. 6.9). In the lower right corner, there are subtle streaks where a clean tarlatan picked up ink from the borders. Due to the degree of inking, flaws in the plate are more evident in the Chicago impression than in other impressions. These flaws include etching-needle work in the margin at left, a mordant-saturated brushstroke at lower right, and scratches in the plate margins overall. Moreover, some scratches in the image are more pronounced than in other impressions. In Christ\u2019s proper right leg, the scratch at shin level that measures approximately 7\u20138 mm can be found in impressions in the collections of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., the Cleveland Art Museum (Harris 51, state 3), and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (Harris 51, state 3). A longer scratch that measures 54 mm and extends from the proper right knee into the drapery at proper right is visible in the New York impression and faintly visible in the Cleveland one. A scratch in the collar of the angel at left can be seen only in the Chicago and New York impressions.\n\nThe paper that Manet or the printer chose for this work had a profound effect on the overall appearance of the print. A brief survey of papers used for other impressions of Dead Christ with Angels reveals a varied selection. Third-state impressions are on Western laid paper (Baltimore Art Museum, Cleveland, and New York). Japanese paper was used for the impression in Washington, D.C. A first-state impression at the Detroit Institute of Art is on a Chinese paper. Nineteenth-century printmakers favored Asian papers as they tended to be softer and absorbed more ink. The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s impression of another Manet print, The Toilette (fig. 6.10) is on a Chinese laid paper and the etching lines are sharply defined, with greater contrast between the lighter and darker areas of the image. The paper is so absorbent that mild strikethrough of the media is visible on the verso (fig. 6.11). The heavy inking of the Chicago impression may be an effort to achieve a similar tonal effect on a Western paper.\n\nThe artwork was examined in January 2014, at which time it was noted that it may have been treated previously, as there is fluorescence in the area of a tideline in the left margin, but no documentation of treatment exists.\n\nThe paper is in fair condition with surface soiling on the recto and verso and an area of surface abrasion associated with the tideline in the left margin. A few tears, all less than 2 mm long, are present in the deckle of the lower edge. The work has been through at least two hinging campaigns: three Japanese paper hinges are present along the upper edge and remnants of a thin, long-fibered paper are present on the verso, along the right edge.\n\nFine pinholes are present in all four corners of the paper. These can be artifacts of studio practice and may not constitute damage.\n\nIn the drapery to the right of Christ, approximately 137 mm from the right edge and 280 mm from the bottom edge, a hair or surface fiber was present between the plate and the print. Although once inked, it has since detached, leaving a thin white line.  \nMar\u00eda Cristina Rivera Ramos and Rachel Freeman\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Henri-Charles Gu\u00e9rard (1846\u20131897), Paris.\n\nBy descent to his son Jean-Raymond Gu\u00e9rard (1883\u2013?).\n\nPrivate collection.\n\nSold by Robert M.

The name and address of the metal planisher\u2014CARON / 17 / RUE DES / VIEUX AUGUSTINS\u2014is stamped on the verso of the copperplate (fig. 6.1). Caron, known only by surname, was active from 1861 to 1869 at the rue des Vieux-Augustins (renamed rue H\u00e9rold in 1881), and his stamp appears on two other copperplates etched by Manet: Lola de Valence in 1863 (the Art Institute holds two impressions, 1953.274 and 1947.817) and the Marine of 1865/66 (also at the Art Institute, 1984.1115); both matrices are in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, R\u00e9serve des Estampes et Photographies, plate numbers 45 and 35, respectively. For the plate of Christ with Angels, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet: Dessins, aquarelles, eaux-fortes, lithographies, correspondence, exh. cat. (Huguette Ber\u00e8s, 1978) no. 93. It remained in the collection of Henri Gu\u00e9rard and his descendants until sometime before the 1978 exhibition.\n\nCharles Baudelaire to Manet, April 1864, in Charles Baudelaire, Correspondance, ed. by Claude Pichois and Jean Ziegler (Gallimard, 1973), vol. 2, p. 352.\n\nThe watermark NF is visible in raking light at Christ\u2019s beard. The sheet was cropped, presumably when still in the Zola family\u2019s collection, and has been reduced by approximately 1 centimeter in height and 1.5 centimeters in width, including part of the signature. Contrary to what is stated in Manet, 1832\u20131883 (Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. [Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983], no. 75), the \u201clight patch\u201d over the sleeve of the weeping angel was not missed by Manet when he added a dark wash to the background: rather, it indicates the light brown overgarment on the angel\u2019s shoulder. So it cannot be invoked as proof that the drawing served directly in preparation for the print; the reverse might well be true, especially given the free handling of the graphite underdrawing on the sheet. Nevertheless, the first state of the print does reproduce the gouache heightening seen on the drawing. See Kathryn Kremnitzer, \u201cManet\u2019s Watercolors: Transition and Translation in the 1860s,\u201d (PhD diss., Columbia University, New York, forthcoming) for further technical discussion of the drawing.\n\nSee Val\u00e9rie Sueur-Hermel, \u201cGoya \u00e0 la Biblioth\u00e8que nationale au XIXe si\u00e8cle,\u201d in Goya graveur, exh. cat. (Petit Palais, 2008), p. 145. This was the first major acquisition of Goya\u2019s prints, following the purchase of Baron Vivant Denon\u2019s superb bound set of the Caprichos (1797 and 1798) at auction in 1827. Apart from the \u201cCourses de taureaux,\u201d the group added in 1856 included thirty-nine rare working proofs of \u201cSc\u00e8nes de l\u2019invasion\u201d (the then-unpublished Disasters of War), several rare early prints, and all the published prints after Vel\u00e1zquez, among them the \u201cphilosopher\u201d figures of Aesop and Menippus, sources for Manet\u2019s own beggar-philosophers (see cats. 10\u201311).\n\nOn the etching revival, see Michel Melot, The Impressionist Print, trans. Caroline Beamish (Yale University Press, 1996). For discussion of Manet\u2019s reliance on Alphonse Legros, F\u00e9lix Bracquemond, and Henri-Charles Gu\u00e9rard, all of whom informed and or assisted with the mechanical aspects of the artist\u2019s etchings, see Michel Melot, \u201cManet and the Print,\u201d in Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983), p. 36. Gu\u00e9rard, a skilled etcher and printmaker in his own right, became Manet\u2019s friend and technical assistant in the 1870s; in 1879 he married Eva Gonzal\u00e8s, Manet\u2019s only pupil. Gu\u00e9rard remained in close contact with Manet\u2019s widow, Suzanne, from whom he received many rare proofs as gifts or on consignment. Gu\u00e9rard sold a number of these to the collector George Lucas, who acquired some of them for himself and others for Samuel P. Avery, which were gifted to the New York Public Library in 1900; see Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983), p. 82, no. 16 Provenance. The print was purchased together with the plate for $90,000 as part of a set of twenty objects from the Henri Gu\u00e9rard Collection offered by Robert Light, presented to the Committee on Prints and Drawings on December 4, 1984, and confirmed during a meeting of the Audit and Budget Committee on December 17. Thanks to Kathryn Kremnitzer and Bart Ryckbosch for their assistance with documenting the plate\u2019s provenance.\n\nFollowing Manet\u2019s death, no proof in the early state was recorded. But one of the three extant proofs passed from Edgar Degas to the Rouart family (and then to Detroit; see fig. 6.3).
