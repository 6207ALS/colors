Join educators Nenette Luarca-Shoaf and Robert Smith III to explore the insights gained when artists meld the personal and political in their depictions of home and housing.</p><p>In this new interactive lecture series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Educators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p> </p>",
