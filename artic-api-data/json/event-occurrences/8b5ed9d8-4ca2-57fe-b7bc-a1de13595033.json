There she worked among a community of Mexican and European artists who drew inspiration from the culture and geography of Mexico, developing her unique practice of juxtaposing Surrealist chance-based techniques with imagery from disciplines as wide-ranging as chivalric romance, ecology, geographic explorations, feminist critique, mysticism, psychology, and tarot.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p><p><em>Remedios Varo: Science Fictions</em>\u2014the first museum exhibition dedicated to the artist in the United States since 2000\u2014brings together more than 20 paintings Varo created in Mexico from 1955 until her death in 1963.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caitlin Haskell </strong>is the Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator in Modern and Contemporary Art and director of Ray Johnson Collections and Research.
