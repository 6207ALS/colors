It must have been one of four new drawings that the Ways transferred to stone and proved on July 21 (apps. II.3 and II.4). Throughout the month of July, Whistler had been hard at work on transfer drawings for lithographs and kept the printers busy as he sent new images for processing, along with letters of instruction, on an almost daily basis. His letters indicate that he was impatient for the Ways to print sets of twenty-five impressions of each of the new lithographs immediately upon his approval of the initial proofs.\n\nWhistler produced four lithographs depicting the Luxembourg Gardens in late 1893 and early 1894 (cat. 68, cat.&amp;nbsp;69, cat. 70, and cat. 81). Returning to the gardens in the summer of 1894, he provided a less elaborate background for the group of figures, although an unidentified building is faintly delineated in the background at upper right. The artist made more limited use of the stump than he had in the previous Luxembourg subjects, applying only slight touches in the foliage of the small tree and in the urn on the balustrade.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid Japanese vellum (193 \u00d7 339 mm), signed; cream laid Japanese vellum (198 \u00d7 335 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (190 \u00d7 242 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid paper (198 \u00d7 331 mm); SC, cream laid paper (205 \u00d7 331 mm).
