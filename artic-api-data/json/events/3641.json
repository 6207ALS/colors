    "description": "<p><strong>The theme for this month\u2019s Intersections is Neutrality. </strong></p><p>Over the holidays, many people do their best to avoid political conversations with family. There might be other times when a person, an institution, or a country try to remain neutral. But is this even possible? And what are the implications of not taking sides? </p><p>>This month\u2019s Intersections considers the position of neutrality. We\u2019ll look at artwork from the 1960s and consider what it means when artists <em>don\u2019t</em> take a stand or try to represent something from a neutral position. In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information. </p>",
