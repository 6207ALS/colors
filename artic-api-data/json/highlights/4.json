In recent years we\u2019ve sought to expand our narratives of European painting and sculpture to include regions beyond France, and this outstanding example of Danish painting will become a cornerstone of the increasingly nuanced histories of modernism on view in our galleries. On view in Gallery 246   The artist Yeesookyung (born in 1963) seeks to free Korean ceramics from the burden of perfection, an ideal imposed by long tradition. Potters in Korea are known to routinely destroy traditional ceramics considered imperfect. Fortunately, these pots find a second life in the art of Yeesookyung, who uses the shards and fragments to create flowing shapes that look like organic life forms. Translated Vase consists of green-glazed stoneware and white porcelain \u2014exemplifying the artistic achievements of the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties respectivly\u2014held together with a mixture of glue to which she adds gold leaf. (The Korean words for \"gold\" and \"crack\" sound the same) For the artist, creating these forms is a harmonious way of merging the ideals of the past with the sensibilities of the present. On view in Gallery 135   Trained in Kyoto, Japan, Katsuji Wakisaka was the first non-Finnish designer to work for Marimekko, a Helsinki-based textile company that became known for embracing the cultural exuberance of the 1960s. Katsuji brought an energetic use of color and a playful style to designs featuring a wide range of themes, from Finnish forests to children\u2019s drawings. The ultra-saturated blue, orange, purple, and red hills of his oka (straw) print present a dynamic view of the Finnish countryside while also reflecting the psychedelic color palette used in posters, fashion, and album covers of the late 1960s and early 1970s. On view in Gallery 285   This early sculpture by Elizabeth Catlett (1915\u20132012) demonstrates her confident abstraction of the human form. Notice the angular features and the way she carved deep into the stone. Catlett developed her expressive, modern sensibility through her study of African art: \u201cAfter all,\u201d she once said, \u201cabstraction was born in Africa.\u201d Incorporating aesthetics of simplification, planarity, and exaggeration, Catlett established her own approach to depicting African American subjects. On view in Gallery 264   Born in Vienna and active in Paris and Mexico City, artist Wolfgang Paalen was an influential Surrealist thinker, exhibition designer, and publisher. In 1936\u201337 he invented the technique of fumage, or drawing with candle smoke, which became his signature. Untitled (Fumage) (1938) is among Paalen's most ambitious and successful large-scale fumages, showing off his technical skill and soaring imagination. The smoke residue and oil paint blend seamlessly, creating abstract forms that suggest both aerial and aquatic creatures coming in and out of view. On view in Gallery 398   On public view for the first time in its history, Camille Claudel\u2019s Young Roman is a portrait of her younger brother, Paul. The seriousness of his expression and direct gaze capture the future writer and diplomat as if he were a young and proud Roman patrician, a gravity that contrasts with the delicate drapery swirling at his shoulders and rippling on his chest. The sculpture was painted by the artist herself to imitate the appearance of ancient bronzes. A critically acclaimed sculptor of the late 19th century, Claudel was largely forgotten after being forcibly interned in a psychiatric hospital in 1913, prematurely ending her career. On view in Gallery 201   In the 1860s, Julie Hart Beers (1834\u20131913) launched a successful career as a landscape painter, supporting herself and her family through her artwork and teaching. She seized the few opportunities available to her for training and studio space through her brothers, who were also painters, and connected with other women artists in New York City. In this composition, a lush forest frames a luminous view of the water and mountains. Beers rendered the trees with swift brushwork and employed minute flourishes to evoke two or three figures on the shoreline. On view in Gallery 170   In La Linda Nasca , Peruvian artist Kukuli Velarde (b.1962) explores the duality of Indigenous and Spanish influences on Andean culture. The low-fired clay sculpture reimagines the statue of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception in Cusco\u2019s cathedral as an ancient Nasca goddess. Crowned in a silver starred halo and adorned with iconography from ancient Nasca ceramics like those stewarded by the Art Institute of Chicago, La Linda Nasca creates a throughline from pre-Columbian traditions to the post-colonial present of contemporary Latin American art. On view in Gallery 136   Tsar Dmitry I, known also as False Dmitry I or Pseudo-Demetrius I, was the only tsar to come to power through military campaigns and popular uprisings. Supported in large part by Polish nobles, he was heavily influenced by Western tastes and politics. His Italian-made helmet, now reunited with its accompanying breast and backplate, was both highly fashionable for the time and a symbol of the tsar\u2019s power. The upper visor above the vision slits is intricately etched with the Moscow coat of arms and an imperial double-headed eagle, announcing the sovereignty of its wearer. Unfortunately, Dmitry\u2019s claim that he was the lost son of Ivan the Terrible was false. Within a year of his rule, the Russian nobility assassinated him and shot his ashes out of a cannon. On view in Gallery 239   The story goes that Saint Romanus of Antioch was martyred in 303 CE for encouraging imprisoned Christians who refused to make sacrifices to Roman gods. Here he is painted alongside Saint Barulas, a child of seven inspired by the elder saint\u2019s words. In this representation of the martyrs by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n (1598-1664), Romanus holds his tongue, torn out by his persecutors, in one hand and a book inscribed with a prayer for the faithful in the other. Painted to support the Counter-Reformation, the Catholic Church\u2019s response to the Protestant movement, Zurbaran would have aimed to make the saints accessible to everyday people. In this hyper-real, detailed depiction, the figures feel close enough to touch. Find this newly conserved painting and frame in Gallery 211   Belgian sculptor George Minne (1866\u20131941) explored the imagery of kneeling youths throughout his career. His obsession peaked in his Fountain of the Kneeling Youths , presented in 1900 at the Vienna Secession, where this plaster was likely shown alongside five counterparts. The audience was both repulsed by the gauntness of the figures and impressed with their haunting impact. Minne\u2019s deep interest in Symbolism is reflected in the mystery and ambiguity of the piece; the posture of the thin young man, kneeling with his arms wrapped tightly around his chest, suggests a closing off of the self, but whether it\u2019s from torment, grief, resignation, contemplation, weariness, or something else, is left to the viewer.
