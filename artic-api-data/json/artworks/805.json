    "description": "<p>Potent symbols, sacred words, and divine protection helped ancient Egyptians transition from the earthly realm to an eternal existence. Interactions between mortals and the gods were depicted on funerary objects including papyri, like this example made for temple singer Tayu-henut-Mut (\u201cthe mistress of [the goddess] Mut\u201d).</p>\n<p>This papyrus shows Tayu-henut-Mut standing with raised hands before an offering table, praising the enthroned god Osiris, ruler of the afterlife. Behind Osiris a scribe has carefully copied spells from the Book of Going Forth by Day. First appearing during the New Kingdom (about 1550 BCE), this religious text is better known today as the Book of the Dead, because scrolls were buried with their owners. Tayu-henut-Mut\u2019s copy includes five spells selected from nearly 200 known options to aid in her journey to eternity, including one for \u201ccausing a man to remember his name.\u201d Egyptians believed that one would cease to exist in the afterlife if their name was forgotten or no longer spoken among the living.</p>\n",
