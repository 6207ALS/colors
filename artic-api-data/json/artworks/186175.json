Two years later, they and others formed the Theosophical Society, dedicated to the exploration of spiritualism and the occult.\n\nIn 1877, Blavatsky published Isis Unveiled, which contained the doctrines, teachings and practices of Theosophy, supposedly derived from a group of masters known as the Mahatmas of Tibet. Though Blavatsky claimed that the masters asked her to act as their conduit to western people, Theosophy has always been plagued by charges that its teachings were plagiarized from a hodgepodge of religious, philosophic and scientific sources.\n\nDespite such charges Theosophy has thrived, with approximately thirty-thousand current members, of whom four-thousand-three-hundred reside in the US. An element of its appeal is the notion that all religions are attempts by man to ascertain \u201cthe Divine,\u201d and as such, each religion has a portion of the truth. Throughout its history, Theosophy has claimed many well-known artists as adherents, both in America and abroad, including Wassily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Franz Kafka, T. S. Eliot, Arthur Dove, Wallace Stevens and W.B. Yeats.\n\nThe Theosophists of Halcyon arrived in California in 1903 from Syracuse, New York. After acquiring a hundred acres, they organized the Temple Home Association according to socialist principles, with all property held in common. The Halcyon Temple was built in 1923\u201324. Its triangular shape is meant to symbolize the heart as well as the trinities that are central to many of the great religious teachings throughout history. The seven doors are symbolic of the \u201ckey number\u201d of the universe (seven days in a week, seven notes between octaves, seven colors of light). All inside dimensions and angles are multiples of seven. The temple still functions as the center of the community. Though no longer a cooperative, half of the people currently living in the town are practicing Theosophists.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
