    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This theatrical scene sets war against peace or love.  In the center, Cupid, the Roman boy-god of love, lies blindfolded.  Mars, god of war, is about to beat the boy, while his mother Venus, goddess of love, looks on fearfully.  Here Mars, who was Venus's lover, punishes Cupid for causing his mother to fall in love with the handsome Adonis.  The painting was made by Bartolomeo Manfredi, a follower of the early 17th century master Caravaggio.  Manfredi's painting is full of Caravaggio-like dramatic contrasts of light and shadow and naturalistic detail.  Notice, for instance, the hairs on Mars's hand, and the lifelike rendering of Cupid's smooth skin.  But other aspects of the painting are more idealized.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: There's also a great element of sensuality in terms of the nude flesh of Cupid, who is not shown as a young child but rather as a young nubile boy.  In contrast to that, or almost as a foil, the figure of Venus, her body and her face have a much more static quality.  They come much more from a tradition of classical sculpture.  You don't have a sense that the face of Venus was executed from a figure from life.</p>\n",
