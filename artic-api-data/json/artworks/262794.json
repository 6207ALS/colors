    "description": "<p>In this scenic composition, Julie Hart Beers contrasted the lush vegetation of a forest in the foreground with the luminous view of a waterway and mountains beyond. She employed swift brushwork to describe the setting, including flourishes to suggest two or three figures alongside a boat at center.<br /><br>Beers built a successful professional career in landscape painting beginning in the 1860s, seizing opportunities available to her\u2014because her brothers were also painters\u2014for training and studio space. She also connected with other female artists in New York City. In addition to income from the sale of her works, Beers supported herself and her family by teaching as well as leading sketching excursions for groups of women throughout New England and the Adirondack Mountains.</p>\n",
