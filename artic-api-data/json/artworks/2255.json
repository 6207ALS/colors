    "description": "<p>Geometric patterns are common in Andean textile art. Although it may appear simple at first look, this panel is far more elaborate than meets the eye: the geometric designs presented here were formed using multiple techniques, with the weaving of the blue and red half-step frets, the outlining in white embroidery, and the edging in cross-knit loop stitches. This pattern creates an overall checkerboard of color, with the juxtaposed colored surfaces further combining to create full-step frets.</p>\n",
