A.D. 41\u201354) issued coins commemorating his parents, Nero Claudius Drusus (see fig. 38.1) and Antonia Minor. This example celebrates the German exploits of Drusus, who in A.D. 9 found \u201ca grave and a name\u201d in that dangerous province. Like his brother Tiberius, who became emperor, Drusus was a stepson of Augustus and one of his best generals. He created several military bases along the Rhine. His achievement won him a posthumous grant by the Senate of the titles Imperator and Germanicus (conqueror of Germany), as attested by the obverse inscription, as well as the right of his offspring in perpetuity to use those names. In his youthful portrait he wears the laurel wreath of military victory; on the reverse, Claudius offers his father the triumph he was never able to enjoy in life. Claudius\u2019s own achievements in Germany in the year 41 and his conquest of Britain in 43, also celebrated on his coinage, may have been the impetus for the minting of this coin. Because of the close family resemblance among Julio-Claudians\u2014a resemblance that was carefully cultivated in artistic representations\u2014numismatic portraits are of less help than one might wish in identifying the many unnamed sculptures of members of the Julio-Claudian family gracing the world\u2019s museums.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Ovid, Fasti 1.597: \u201cet mortem et nomen Druso Germania fecit.\u201d Today he is called \u201cElder Drusus\u201d to distinguish him from Julius Caesar Drusus, the son of Emperor Tiberius.\n\nIncluding Mainz, where there remains a monument\u2014Dio Cassius calls it a cenotaph\u2014built in his memory by his soldiers: the so-called Drususstein.
