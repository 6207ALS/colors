After Robert Motherwell discovered Ben Belitt\u2019s translation of Raphael Alberti\u2019s <em>A la Pintura</em> (On Painting), Motherwell recalled, \u201cI had found the text for a livre d\u2019artiste, a text whose every line set into motion my innermost painterly feelings. . . . This poetry is made for painters, and this livre was made for the poetry. I meant the two to be wedded, as in a medieval psalter, but with my own sense of the modern.\u201d Just as Motherwell was inspired by poetry, Alberti found constant source material in the visual arts. <em>A la Pintura</em> was his homage to the collection of master paintings in the Prado Museum in Madrid and was dedicated to his friend and fellow Spaniard Pablo Picasso.</p>\n",
