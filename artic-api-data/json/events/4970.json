Weston Associate Curator of Japanese Art at the Art Institute of Chicago. </p><p>One of the most successful contemporary print artists, Noda Tetsuya uses a signature printing process that combines photography, silkscreen, and woodblock printing to capture the small and large moments of his daily life.

Today, the series includes more than 500 images.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"/exhibitions/9424/noda-tetsuya-my-life-in-print\"><em>Noda Tetsuya: My Life in Print</em></a><em> </em>at the Art Institute of Chicago is the largest museum exhibition of Noda's work in North American.
