Hutchinson, 1949.202\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Between 1900 and 1903, Henri Matisse repeatedly reworked the soft and likely dampened clay of one of his earliest sculptures, The Serf, in what he reported to be up to five hundred studio sessions. Outside of anatomical representation, he was searching for a constellation of elementary marks that together could evoke the human form. The artist\u2019s approach responded to the work of Auguste Rodin and Paul C\u00e9zanne. In 1899, one year before he began work on The Serf, Matisse purchased a plaster bust of the journalist Henri Rochefort by Rodin (1884\u201398; fig. 3.1) that had been in the collection of \u00c9douard Manet and C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Three Bathers (1879\u201382; fig. 3.2) from the dealer Ambroise Vollard. Both works exemplify the use of a balanced synthesis of constructive marks to represent their subjects. In Matisse\u2019s early studio nudes, including Nude Study in Blue (c. 1899\u20131900; fig. 3.3) and Male Model\u2014Sketch (c. 1900; fig. 3.4), he similarly experimented with shedding naturalism and increasingly used the simplified flat strokes of color that informed his approach in The Serf. He echoed themes from Rodin\u2019s work by using the aging Italian model Giovanni Bevilacqua (sometimes spelled Bevilaqua), who resembled Cesidio Pignatelli, a model that Rodin used for a number of early works, including The Walking Man (c. 1900; fig. 3.5). Matisse\u2019s choice confounded peers such as the painter Jean Puy, who dismissed Bevilacqua as \u201can anthropoid\u201d with \u201cthe face of an orang-outang [sic], half-hidden in his long hair and beard.\u201d Contrasting with the dynamic pose of The Walking Man, the heavy stance of the figure in The Serf remains firmly anchored to the ground. Instead of the fragmented pairing of anatomical and material marks in Rodin\u2019s sculpture, Matisse adopted a holistic approach and evoked the body by creating visual correlations between gestural modeled forms. In place of a naturalistic depiction of a collarbone or chest in The Serf, for example, he balanced concave slices above and below two lumpy masses over the figure\u2019s stomach to accentuate the downward-facing head and angled pose of the body.\n\nMatisse\u2019s work in sculpture informed his painting; however, The Serf also tested the expressive potential of abstract shapes and forms in the round. His comparably sized painting Male Model (c. 1900; fig. 3.6) shows Bevilacqua in a similar pose in wide brushstrokes of muted blue, green, and flesh tones. To accentuate the stance of the figure in The Serf, which turns diagonally from the base, the artist added thick, textured masses to the upper back and belly to balance its exaggerated profile. As Matisse wrote in his \u201cNotes d\u2019un peintre\u201d of 1908, the same year this work was cast, \u201cwhat interests me most is neither still life nor landscape but the human figure . . . I do not insist upon all the details of the face, on setting them down one-by-one with anatomical exactitude. . . . I discover amid the lines of the face those which suggest the deep gravity that persists in every human being.\u201d In keeping with his statement, the artist distilled the human figure into modeled and cut surfaces in The Serf. A 1904 photograph of Matisse in his studio next to an earlier version of the sculpture (fig. 3.7) highlights one of the most dramatic changes the artist made: removing the figure\u2019s arms. He likely had a two-part plaster mold produced from the original version of The Serf to create a plaster cast. When the artist moved to a new studio at the H\u00f4tel Biron in 1908, which was also occupied by Rodin and became the Mus\u00e9e Rodin in 1919, the plaster cast reportedly suffered damage that may have resulted in the artist cutting off its arms before producing a piece mold for sand casting. Alongside the accumulation of material on the trunk of the figure, the artist\u2019s choice to cut off the arms calls attention to the core of the sculptural body and its careful balance of light-reflecting masses that embody the stark physicality of The Serf.\n\nThis edition of The Serf, numbered 1 of 10, was cast by Bingen &amp; Costenoble in Paris in the fall of 1908 for Matisse\u2019s early supporters and close friends Michael and Sarah Stein of Paris and San Francisco (see fig. 3.8). It entered the collection of the Art Institute in 1949.  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse initially made the model of The Serf in a soft material, probably clay but possibly a commercial material such as Plasticine. A two-part plaster mold would have been made from the soft clay version, likely by a professional mold maker. The model would almost certainly have been damaged or destroyed when the mold was removed. From this waste mold a plaster version of The Serf was then cast, and with this master plaster, a professional mold maker would then carefully produce a piece mold for sand casting.\n\nThe plaster model of The Serf was damaged when Matisse moved to a new studio at the H\u00f4tel Biron in 1908. Possibly as a result of this accident, Matisse altered the form of the sculpture and removed its arms. From the final, completed form of The Serf, another piece mold was made for sand casting.\n\nThe bronze edition of The Serf was sand cast around 1908 at Bingen &amp; Costenoble, Paris. It has a dark-brown patina. X-rays of the object show evidence of the casting. The bronze cast required extensive surface finishing by foundry specialists to remove sprues and vents. The raised ridges of joins between piece mold parts were also removed, except for a vertical seam along the left side of the head.\n\nIncised: Henri Matisse 1/10 (top of base, back proper left corner) (fig. 3.9).\n\nBronze (an alloy of primarily copper and tin). ICP-OES analysis was conducted on a sample (fig. 3.10).\n\nSand-cast. The figure and the base were cast separately and later bolted together.\n\nBingen &amp; Costenoble, Paris.\n\nThe sculpture has a dark-brown patina.\n\nThe core is sandy and gray-black in color (fig. 3.11). X-rays of the object (fig. 3.12) show many thin wire core pins (fig. 3.12.1). Two metal rods, about 5 mm thick, in the interior of the proper left leg extend up into the proper left side of the torso; a one-centimeter-thick curved rod, roughly U-shaped and now positioned at an angle across the pelvis, appears to be wrapped with wire at its midpoint (fig. 3.12.2). These rods (fig. 3.12.4) may have been part of an armature for the core; the leg rods might also be core vents.\n\nAreas where the patina had been lost and adjacent intact areas had been toned with a thick, green-tinted wax at some point, possibly following a 1983 cleaning. In 1990 Art Institute conservators reduced the thick wax where the original patina was still present and inpainted the loss areas with acrylic paint.\n\nThe sculpture is structurally sound. The patina and some fine surface detail have been worn away at the top of the head, the shoulders, the shoulder blades, the stomach, the penis, and the proper left foot.  \nSuzanne R.

Mezzatesta, Henri Matisse Sculptor/Painter (Fort Worth: Kimball Art Museum 1984), pp. 38-43; Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, 1869\u20131918 (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1986), pp. 85-88; and Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cInterruptions and Returns,\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, p. 225, and idem, The Age of Picasso and Matisse, p. 20.\n\nIn the winter of 1900, Henri Matisse called on Rodin at his studio at rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9 in Paris to show the sculptor his drawings. In 1937, Matisse wrote of the encounter: \u201cI once had the good fortune to receive Rodin\u2019s advice on the subject of my drawings. . . . Yet the advice he gave in no wise [sic] suited me, and on this occasion Rodin merely showed his petty side.\u201d Matisse, \u201cDivagations,\u201d Verve 1, no. 1 (Dec. 1937), as translated in Jack Flam, Matisse on Art, rev. ed. (University of California Press, 1995), p. 126. As Maurice Denise reported, Rodin told Matisse: \u201cFuss over it, fuss over it. When you have fussed over it two weeks more, come back and show it to me again.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Gide, The Journals of Andr\u00e9 Gide, vol. 1, 1889\u20131913, trans. Justin O\u2019Brien (Knopf, 1947), p. 174. In 1956, Matisse told Raymond Escholier, \u201cI was taken to Rodin\u2019s studio in the rue de l\u2019Universit\u00e9, by one of his pupils who wanted to show my drawings to his master. Rodin, who received me kindly, was only moderately interested. He told me I had facility of hand, which wasn\u2019t true. He advised me to do \u2018fussy\u2019 drawings and to show them to him. I never went back.\u201d Escholier, Matisse, ce vivant (Fayard, 1956), pp. 161\u201362, as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 284n6.\n\nOliver Shell, \u201cSeeing Figures: Exhibition and Vision in Matisse\u2019s Sculpture,\u201d in Kosinski, Fisher, and Nash, Matisse, p. 51. Around the same time, Matisse traded one of his canvases for Paul Gauguin\u2019s Head of a Boy (1886\u201388); see Barr, Matisse, p. 39. See also Rebecca A. Rabinow, \u201cVollard and Matisse,\u201d in Rabinow, Douglas W. Druick, and Maryline Assante di Panzillo, C\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-garde, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2006), pp. 131\u201333.\n\nRecalling his early interest in C\u00e9zanne\u2019s constructive brushstrokes, Matisse recounted to Alfred H. Barr an 1899 conversation with the post-Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro in which Matisse said, \u201cA C\u00e9zanne is a moment of the artist while a[n] [Alfred] Sisley is a moment of nature.\u201d Barr, Matisse, p. 38.\n\nWhile Bevilacqua has often been assumed to be another name for Cesidio Pignatelli, recent scholarship has distinguished the two Italian models, who were both from Gallinaro in the Val di Comino. See Hilary Spurling, \u201cMatisse\u2019s Italian Models,\u201d in Matisse and the Model, exh. cat., ed. Ann Dumas (Eykyn Maclean, 2011), p. 62. Cesidio Pignatelli (1846\u20131929) and Giovanni Bevilacqua (1871\u20131968) were distinguished from each other in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pinet, Matisse-Rodin, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e Rodin, 2009), pp. 85\u201387; and identified in Michele Santulli, Modelle e Modelli Ciociari nell\u2019arte europea a Roma, Parigi, Londra nel 1800\u20131900 (Ciociaria Sconosciuta, 2011), pp. 104\u201306, 168\u201370.\n\nAs quoted in Hilary Spurling, The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse; The Early Years, 1869\u20131908 (Knopf, 1998), pp. 214\u201315.\n\nSpeaking about The Serf, John Elderfield has argued that \u201cit transposes in fact certain aspects of Matisse\u2019s C\u00e9zannism\u2014and with them the self-referential qualities developing in his painting\u2014to a sculptural motif that is indebted to Rodin in stance and gesture; and it revises Rodin\u2019s heroic monumentality to create something far more aesthetically contained.\u201d See Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, Including Remainder-Interest and Promised Gifts (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1978), p. 32.\n\nSee Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection, pp. 28\u201330.\n\nHenri Matisse, \u201cNotes d\u2019un peintre,\u201d La grande revue 2, no. 24 (Dec. 25, 1908), as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 41.\n\nArtists including Jean Cocteau had previously also rented rooms at the H\u00f4tel Biron, but by 1911 Rodin occupied the entire residence. It later became the Mus\u00e9e Rodin. Accounts by Hans Purrmann (see fig. 3.8, third from the right), who helped manage the Matisse academy in 1908, and Matisse\u2019s daughter, Marguerite, recall that the arms of The Serf fell off when Matisse moved to his new studio at the H\u00f4tel Biron. See Shell, \u201cSerf,\u201d p. 108n1. However, scholars including Albert Edward Elsen and Jack Flam have argued that Matisse may have cut the arms as an aesthetic decision. Elsen speculates that the artist made the choice \u201cperhaps to liberate the silhouette of the thighs, as Rodin had often done in his partial figures.\u201d See Elsen, The Sculpture of Henri Matisse (Abrams, 1972), p. 30; and Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, 1869\u20131918 (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 487n18.

See Shell, \u201cThe Serf,\u201d p. 108n1.\n\nModern sculpture alloys are usually actually alloys of copper, tin and zinc, with lead added to improve pouring.\n\nAnalysis by Marcus L.

According to Spurling, all of Sarah\u2019s early Matisse acquisitions\u2014including The Serf\u2014were \u201cbought or borrowed from Leo and Gertrude [Stein]\u201d (p. 157).\n\nNot in exhibition.
