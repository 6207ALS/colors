    "description": "<p>Louise Lawler first rose to prominence in 1984 when she photographed the renowned collection of modern and contemporary masterworks owned by Mr. and Mrs. Burton Tremaine as it was installed in their Connecticut home. Since that time, Lawler has focused her camera on the installation of works of art to examine the institutional frameworks that determine their significance. Her photographs of objects installed in museums, galleries, private homes, corporate headquarters, and auction houses demonstrate the ways that an artwork\u2019s display and contextualization shape it\u2019s meaning. The resulting photographs transcend pure documentation, occupying a key position within conceptual discourse. Her appropriation of works in situ\u2014coupled with her clever use of language\u2014addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. Ultimately it is Lawler\u2019s seeming impartiality that makes her images successful; her work reveals, rather than elaborates, criticizes, or laments, existing conditions. In this regard, Lawler shares the \u201cinstitutional critique\u201d strategies of Hans Haacke, Daniel Buren, Michael Asher, or Marcel Broodthaers, and appropriation strategies used by contemporaries such as Cindy Sherman, Sherrie Levine, Barbara Kruger, and Allan McCollum.\u00a0 As Robert Storr has suggested, Lawler\u2019s work is informed by \u201c\u2026an unassuming familiarity with museological stagecraft.\u201d The displacements she engineers are the key to her strength as a conceptual, not documentary, artist.</p>\n<p>Lawler\u2019s photograph <em>Beige</em> was taken at The Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 1987. It depicts an installation of minimalist works from the museum\u2019 s permanent collection.  The works on display include untitled pieces by Brice Marden (1971\u201372), Craig Kauffman (1968), Larry Bell (1967\u201368), and Peter Alexander (1969). Typical of Lawler\u2019s oeuvre, there is a visual decentering that focuses attention on the works\u2019 surroundings and placement rather than on the work itself. In Beige a gallery wall obstructs the full view of Marden\u2019s painting, attention is given to the gallery\u2019s track lighting, and works by Kauffman and Alexander overlap, forcing them to be viewed simultaneously. Lawler\u2019s distinct way of seeing makes visible elements of museological organization and the apparatuses of presentation\u2014elements that are authoritative, but traditionally exist outside of the museum going experience.</p>\n",
