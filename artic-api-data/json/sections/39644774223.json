The best-known examples are paintings from the earlier period. B\u00e9 b\u00e9 (fig. 124.2 [W 540]) and Te tamari no atua (The Birth or Child of God) (fig. 124.3 [W 541]), both from 1896, relate to the birth of a son with his Tahitian partner Pahura (Pao\u2019ura), a child who, regrettably, would live for just a few days. His later images of the Nativity, including the oil painting Nativity (fig. 124.4 [W 621]), this print, and several related studies, appear to deal primarily with philosophical rather than biographical concerns. He made them in the first years of the twentieth century when, with his health failing, he was preoccupied by questions of spirituality. Nonetheless, as this entry suggests, events in the artist\u2019s life surely impacted on the imagery of the Art Institute\u2019s extraordinary print.\n\nA sense of this context assists interpretation of Nativity. Most significantly, in 1902, Gauguin transcribed some notes he had begun in Tahiti around five years previously. The rambling treatise that resulted\u2014a text of twenty-four-thousand words entitled L\u2019esprit moderne and le catholicisme (Catholicism and the modern mind)\u2014revealed his intense dislike for church dogma and his interest in comparative religion (fig. 124.5). Although Gauguin did not choose the Chicago print to adorn the cover of L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme, he may have designed it with that purpose in mind, for in technique, style, and subject, it is similar to the two transfer drawings depicting the Nativity that he did employ: one adhered to the manuscript\u2019s front cover (fig. 124.5, right [Field 1973 82a]) and the other to the back (fig. 124.5, left [Field 1973 82b]). These images relate to a third, larger print known in recent years as Women and Angels in a Studio (fig. 124.6 [Field 1973 81]). The artist called such works \u201cdrawings,\u201d but as Richard Field observed, they were more properly transfer drawings, made using one or two different types of ink.\n\nAs the artist explained in March 1902, and as is clear from an example in the Philadelphia Museum of Art (fig. 124.7 [Field 1973 87]), this process involved placing a sheet of paper on a layer of ink and drawing on the sheet\u2019s verso to create an image on the recto. \u201cFirst you roll out printer\u2019s ink on a sheet of paper of any sort,\u201d he explained, \u201cthen lay a second sheet on top of it and draw whatever pleases you. The harder and thinner your pencil (as well as your paper), the finer will be your resulting line.\u201d However, occasionally his process clearly involved subsequent stages. The presence of graphite and red chalk on the verso of the Chicago Nativity suggests that it was built up over at least two campaigns. At the time of the 2014 Gauguin: Metamorphoses exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, Erika Mosier suggested that Gauguin rolled out a second inked sheet of paper and then repeated the process using the impression from the first pull, applying pressure selectively to its verso in order to enhance the image on the recto. She illustrated this with examples that included Tahitian Woman with Evil Spirit (fig. 124.8 [Field 1973 67]), one of a series of large monotypes that the artist made around 1900, which exhibits layers of graphite and blue pencil on the verso. Each medium had a different function: Gauguin used the former for fine detailing and the latter to emphasize contours.\n\nIn their recent study of Nativity, building on important earlier work by Peter Zegers, Art Institute conservators added further nuance to this hypothesis. Revisiting the practical process of his printmaking, they posited that Gauguin rolled ink onto glass, not paper, to make the museum\u2019s monotype, as this would facilitate the pulling of impressions. Further investigation using photometric stereo revealed that the white lines across the surface of the image did not result from incision or indentation of the paper but instead record an absence of media resulting from the transfer process.\n\nGauguin\u2019s monotype technique gradually reduced his control over the image, introducing a degree of chance that he seems to have welcomed. This is confirmed by a summary of his process that he gave in his 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After), supposedly in the words of an anonymous \u201clover of art\u201d: \u201c[Gauguin] traces a drawing, then he traces this tracing, and so on until the moment when, like the ostrich with his head in the sand, he decides that it does not resemble the original any longer. Then!! He signs.\u201d In relation to the theme of the Nativity, Gauguin\u2019s process itself may have symbolic significance. The transfer drawing provided him with a perfect way to explore the mysteries of creation. In their identification with the Trinity, his earlier works had been literal, but in later years his relationship with spirituality seems to have grown increasingly esoteric. While in Breton works such as Christ in the Garden of Olives (fig. 124.9 [W 326]) he had painted Christ with his own features, he soon moved away from this strategy. In 1897, with Te tamari no atua (see fig. 124.3), he did not include a self-portrait; but painting his mistress as Mary\u2014whose languorous pose suggests their offspring was conceived through coitus\u2014he allowed viewers to compare him to God the Father. Potentially, if the transfer drawings liken artistic endeavors to divine creation, they evoke the still-less corporeal concept of the Holy Spirit. In these works, Gauguin\u2019s touch is at once absent and omnipresent: while he made the Nativity indirectly (avoiding conventional contact with the surface), the pressure of his hands on the verso created marks that resemble atmospheric effects, a unique and overarching trace of his hand.\n\nAs Richard Brettell surmised in the 1980s, Gauguin\u2019s writings tend to present Christ\u2019s birth as a supernatural event, foretold in earlier texts from other faiths. This is echoed in how, quite often, the artist\u2019s transfer drawings of the Nativity seem to bear little connection with their presumed theme but instead convey a vague sense of the spiritual. On a small transfer drawing that Gauguin pasted into Avant et apr\u00e8s (fig. 124.10 [Field 1973 123])\u2014a work that reverses part of the Art Institute print\u2014he added the inscription \u201cFantasies religieuses,\u201d a clear indication that the image was a variation on a theme rather than a literal depiction of a Nativity.\n\nIn the same vein, although the title of the work is not the artist\u2019s own, the Art Institute\u2019s Nativity seems to bear little relation to its presumed subject matter. The Holy Family does feature, but it appears to the side of the image rather than at the center. Nor are its members immediately recognizable. The Christ Child\u2014identifiable by the short rays of divine light that radiate from his head\u2014does not gaze adoringly at his mother but is instead distracted by something on the floor toward which he extends his hand. Mary is identifiable by a halo made up of concentric circles, but which of the group is Joseph is unclear. Ambiguous adult figures occupy most of the composition, but only two (the praying man at the upper left and the leaning man seated on the ground) pay attention to the new arrival. The others turn their faces away. One figure, androgynous in appearance, extends an arm above its head and covers its right eye. The final figure in the group, seated between Mary and the leaning man, looks vacantly into the distance. The setting is not a stable, but rather a hut or cave, and the characters (in contrast to conventional Western Nativity scenes) are non-European.\n\nGiven the increasing interest among Roman Catholics and Protestants alike in comparative religion in late nineteenth-century Polynesia, in principle Gauguin\u2019s choice to stage his Nativity scene in an apparently non-Western setting was uncontroversial. Both denominations were keen to suggest that indigenous spiritual practices could evolve into Christian customs. By this logic, to set biblical content in his immediate context was highly appropriate. Gauguin\u2019s art had long mixed European and non-Western references; his Te tamari no atua, which is very clearly a Nativity scene, was no exception. Yet the Art Institute\u2019s work is different in that it makes little distinction between its sacred and secular characters, and the scene takes place in an unidentifiable place and time, even if the figures appear Polynesian. Coupled with the artist\u2019s irreverent behavior around 1902, the iconography of this transfer drawing would probably have troubled Gauguin\u2019s Catholic and Protestant French neighbors alike, while that of the print now in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly (fig. 124.11 [Field 1973 85]) would surely have caused offense for its unashamedly physical depiction of childbirth.\n\nSome of the artist\u2019s content choices in Nativity and related works may have been shaped by his experience of, or readings on, Polynesian birthing practices. As Elizabeth Childs suggested, in singling out a figure holding a platter in the background of the monotype for placement on the front cover of L\u2019esprit moderne et le Catholicisme (fig. 124.5), Gauguin may have been mindful of traditional customs. After losing her first child with the artist, Pahura gave birth to a second, \u00c9mile (see cat. 122). In September 1902, on Hiva Oa, Gauguin and his last recorded partner (a teenage girl named Marie-Rose Vaeoho), had a daughter. Though both women were Christian, it seems logical that they would have brought the artist into contact with practices and rituals that were new to him and that contrasted starkly with those he had encountered in Europe.\n\nSuch an experience could, for instance, account for why Gauguin set the Art Institute\u2019s Nativity and the related painting (fig. 124.4) in confined spaces. In the Marquesas, births took place in a specially constructed house (fa\u2019 e taina) away from family sleeping quarters, following religious restrictions, or tapu (on which the Western word taboo is based). It was customary for the expectant father to sleep there with his partner to protect her and the newborn from vehine hae, a spirit who was thought to enter the fa\u2019 e taina at night with the intent to abduct. It was also understood that before a birth, a spirit called fanua could enter the fa\u2019 e taina and inhabit the mother\u2019s body. If this happened, at the time of delivery the fanua would kill both the woman and her issue. Perhaps the strange figure at the center of the transfer drawing relates to such beliefs; in the small version of the print (fig. 124.10), its features are reduced to a menacing glare. However, given Gauguin\u2019s diverse range of references, it is unlikely that malevolent Marquesan spirits provided the sole motivation for the figure\u2019s sinister presence. By 1902 he had lost three children (although it is not known whether he ever learned of the death of his son Clovis in 1900), had survived an apparent suicide attempt, and was in failing health. His thoughts must have turned frequently to mortality. It is surely no coincidence that, as Peter Zegers observed, the figure resembles the haunting subject of his 1891 Madame Death (fig. 124.12).\n\nAnother detail of Women and Angels in a Studio, in the fragment presented in Avant et apr\u00e8s (fig. 124.10), and the painted 1902 Nativity might relate to another set of customs surrounding birth in the Marquesas. On the island, while a father could be present at a birth, only women were allowed to assist directly in the delivery because of the tapu forbidding men to touch female blood. Female relations assisted with delivery, which may explain the presence of a female figure with a cloth in these images. Midwife Anna Nakamura interpreted the woman\u2019s gesture as rubbing the mother\u2019s uterus, which would encourage a contraction, in order to deliver the placenta or help reduce blood loss. Given that the birthed placenta would be wrapped and buried ritually, Gauguin may have based this detail on observation.\n\nIn stark contrast to conventional Nativity imagery, another woman\u2014notably not the mother\u2014cradles the newborn in her arms in these images. In the painting, the woman being tended to does not have a halo; rather, it is the guardian who resembles the Virgin Mary. Even if the works reflect aspects of indigenous Polynesian traditions, more significantly, the images question the conventional family unit. Gauguin had little respect for marriage; in L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme, he went so far as to call for its abolition in favor of a society in which \u201cour mother, our daughter, our sister has the right to earn her bread, to love him who pleases her, has the right to dispose of her body and her beauty.\u201d He took comfort in his perception that \u201cChristianity means nothing here [in the Marquesas]. . . . Fortunately despite all of its efforts, together with the civilized laws of inheritance, marriage is nothing but a ceremony for fun.\u201d Likewise, the expanded company of adults in several of the works might relate to the ways in which, to the artist\u2019s delight, children born outside of marriage in Polynesia were (as he understood it) accepted into the community without question. \u201cHere, everyone looks on a child as nature\u2019s greatest blessing and people vie with one another to adopt one,\u201d he wrote, evidently reassured by how his new offspring would not be tarnished by illegitimacy. If it is hard to discern which figures in Nativity are related to the child, it may be Gauguin\u2019s way of documenting a deliberate refusal of European notions of family and of employing a sacred theme to validate his alternative way of life.\n\nGauguin\u2019s interest in comparative religion was influenced by the writings on spiritualism of Gerald Massey, a nineteenth-century British author who understood Christ as a mythical figure and who interpreted biblical content in relation to the beliefs of ancient Egypt and of different, contemporary faiths. Gauguin\u2019s repurposing of imagery, which made religious scenes quotidian and quotidian scenes religious, appears to compliment Massey\u2019s interest in interchangeable narratives. For example, the artist seems to have divided the matrix (fig. 124.6) to create the images on the front and back covers of L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme (fig. 124.5). For the image on the front cover, he traced one figure from the upper right corner of the matrix and four from its lower right, omitting the characters from the upper center. For that on the back cover, he used the remaining figures from the upper left, before reproducing the woman from the lower left among three new figures: Mary, Christ, and a reclining male figure who (by default) may be Joseph. Sheets in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris (including fig. 124.13 [Field 1973 35]), suggest that the additional characters could even have been added individually; they show that some of Gauguin\u2019s monotypes, having no coherent composition of their own, were collections of independent motifs for transfer.\n\nAs Richard Field suggested in 1973, it is likely that the Art Institute\u2019s sheet also played a part in a reproductive process, although definite correspondences between the print and other transfer drawings are yet to emerge. To offer some speculation, however, perhaps the mother and child in a smaller Nativity scene (fig. 124.14 [Field 1973 83]) show the first stages of transference of the mother, child, and reclining woman in the museum\u2019s example. The fragment that the artist included in Avant et apr\u00e8s (fig. 124.10) might also indicate that, at some stage, Gauguin divided the matrix as he did in the prints for the cover of Catholicism and the Modern Mind. Here the praying figure appears not to the far left of Mary, but to the upper right, while the figure that wraps its arm above its head (as mentioned above) is present only in a set of menacing teeth that, divorced from a body, hovers in blank space.\n\nBut more readily, before they invite the viewer to consider similarities between belief systems or cultures, the artist\u2019s Nativity scenes (like certain of his written statements) seem to explore profoundly personal concerns. Another small transfer drawing for Avant et apr\u00e8s, one that relates to the Art Institute\u2019s Nativity, bears the inscription \u201cRengaines classiques\u201d (Same old story) above an image of a woman who seems to be recovering from childbirth (fig. 124.15 [Field 1973 122]). His choice of wording and the lack of obviously holy figures suggest that there is nothing remarkable about the depicted event; yet, the fact that he used this motif in some of his nativities, where the women are in the company of angels, indicates simultaneously that there is wonder in the mundane. Though visually removed from his earlier output, to some extent, the transfer drawings of the Nativity explore a constant theme of Gauguin\u2019s art: the relationship between secular and sacred realms and the status of creativity, prosaic yet miraculous.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Given by Robert Allerton (1873\u20131964) Chicago, to the Art Institute, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 877, as Polynesians (Group of).\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Paul Gauguin, Apr. 3\u2013May 4, 1946, cat. 60, as Group of Polynesians.\n\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Gauguin in Tahiti, Apr. 1\u2013May 14, 1950, no cat.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Gauguin: Loan Exhibition for the Benefit of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York City, Inc., Apr. 5\u2013May 5, 1956, cat. 73, as Virgin and Child surrounded by five Figures.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture, Feb. 12\u2013Mar. 29, 1959, cat. 191; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Apr. 23\u2013May 31, 1959.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, Mar. 20\u2013May 13, 1973, cat. 84 (ill.).\n\nWashington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 262 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, as Gauguin, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Washington, D.C., and Chicago only).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Institute of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, ed.

Gauguin drew much of his material for his circa 1893 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) from Moerenhout\u2019s early nineteenth-century description of his time in Tahiti. Moerenhout recounted how Tahitians, prior to contact with Europeans, routinely sacrificed their children so that the mother\u2019s beauty would not be compromised by the responsibility of childrearing. He claimed that children\u2019s throats were slit before there could be any parent-child bonding. Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), pp. 496\u201398. Although there is no suggestion of such practices in Gauguin\u2019s transfer drawings, the influence of anthropological texts on Westerners such as he may have resulted in the projection of cultural anxieties onto the texts and illustrations they studied.\n\nE. S. Craighill Handy, The Native Culture in the Marquesas (Honolulu Museum, 1923), pp. 72\u201373.
