Because of their cost, precious materials were often recycled and refashioned. This 16th-century textile altar frontal has been augmented with more recent fringe and trimmings around the perimeter. The placement of these new elements echo the style of 16th-century frontals; they may have replaced originals that had become unsightly with age.</p>\n",
