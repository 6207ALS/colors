Rather than portraying a figure in diaphanous drapery, Whistler has given the nude body greater solidity by using a more assertive line and by anchoring her against a solid support. The model, as in other lithographs of these years, is probably one of the Pettigrew sisters. This lithograph, like The Dancing Girl (cat. 29) and Model Draping (cat. 31), is closely related to the artist\u2019s contemporaneous work in chalk and pastel. The pose is virtually identical to that of the figure in the pastel The Fortune Teller\u2014A Red Note (fig. 33a [M 1083]), although in the lithograph she sits on a chest reading a book, while in the pastel she sits on the edge of a table holding a teacup. Slight adjustments in the poses suggest the different nature of these activities, but the two works so clearly explore the same theme of repose and absorption that it is not surprising that Whistler himself confused the two images some years later. In 1893 he wrote from Paris to T. R. Way requesting \u201chalf a dozen [beautiful pulls] of the little nude figure resting holding a cup of tea\u201d (letter 69).\n\nThe Little Nude Model, Reading sold better than any other lithograph in Whistler\u2019s 1895\u201396 exhibition at the Fine Art Society (see app. II.2 and app. III.3), and only one impression remained in his estate in 1903. T. R. Way counted it among his favorite images, praising it in his essay of 1913: \u201cAmong the nudes perhaps the Little Nude Model Reading (29) is the most delightful. The charm of form and suggestion of color, the perfect composition as she sits upon the little cabinet, all given with such mastery and economy of touch\u2014surely there are few drawings of his generation to equal it.\u201d The Little Nude Model, Reading exists in only one state, and bears a single butterfly monogram on the stone.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (320 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (320 \u00d7 205 mm), signed.
