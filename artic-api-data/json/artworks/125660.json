    "description": "<p>\u201cI paint the things I have experienced,\u201d Jacob Lawrence once said. In <em>The Wedding</em>, Lawrence depicted both the solemnity and the joy of a marriage ceremony and the coming together of families. Positioning the figures with their backs to the viewer, Lawrence\u2019s composition invites us to participate in the couple\u2019s major life event. Although the preacher\u2019s face is only partially defined, he appears to look down with great seriousness as the two contemplate their vows. The large, colorful urns overflowing with flowers signify happiness and may also represent the future prosperity of this union.</p>\n<p>Lawrence depicted the histories and events of black Americans\u2014whether through individual compositions such as <em>The Wedding</em> that commemorated the everyday activities of his fellow Harlem residents, or through series of paintings that explored subjects ranging from the Great Migration to the story of Harriet Tubman.</p>\n",
