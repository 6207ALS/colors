Commodus was replaced by the excellent Pertinax, who was assassinated only three months into his reign; the Praetorian Guard then auctioned off the empire to the highest bidder. Three armies in the provinces revolted at this indignity: the general who got to Rome first was L. Septimius Severus (fig. 58.1), a native of Lepcis Magna in Africa, who was the governor of the province of Upper Pannonia. He won Rome without a battle, was accepted by the Senate, and replaced the treacherous Praetorian Guard with field legionaries from the provinces. It was a sign of the practical meritocracy that marks Severus\u2019s relatively long reign (A.D. 193\u2013211).\n\nThe Victory (VICT[oria] AVG[usta]) on the reverse is a well-earned tribute. Severus defeated the two rival claimants to the imperial throne, destroyed the Parthian kingdom, and restored a Roman province in Mesopotamia, reorganized the defenses of the German and North African borders, and ended his career by stabilizing the northern province of Britain. The Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum (fig. 58.2) is only one of the many monuments he left in Rome, Lepcis Magna, and elsewhere. The name PERT[inax] added to his own on the obverse celebrates him as \u201cavenger of Pertinax,\u201d while the striking similarity of his portrait to late images of Marcus Aurelius may be part of a concerted campaign to connect himself to the Antonine dynasty (see fig. 58.3). On the reverse he is proclaimed consul and holder of tribunician power for the second time, while the obverse names him augustus and notes that he was acclaimed imperator three times; these honors date the coin to A.D. 194\u201395.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Baharal, \u201cPortraits of the Emperor L.
