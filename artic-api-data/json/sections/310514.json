III.2, III.3, V.1  \nLifetime Exhibitions: London 1895\u201396 (no. 48, as The Little Draped Figure in 1st ed. of catalogue, and as The Draped Figure [Back View] in 2d ed.); Chicago 1900b (no. 62)\n\nThere is little primary evidence to help with the dating of this graceful image. An impression was sent to the Fine Art Society on 7 August 1894, and two impressions were sent to Charles Lang Freer the following day. Although there is no mention of the lithograph in Whistler\u2019s correspondence prior to this time, it seems probable that The Draped Figure, Back View was drawn in the fall of 1893 on one of the small lithographic stones Whistler had obtained in Paris (see also cat. 74, cat. 75, cat. 78, cat. 79, and cat. 80). One of these stones was sent to London, but when the results of the Ways\u2019 printing were unsatisfactory, Whistler must have set aside the other stones and a drawing on finegrained transfer paper (cat. 76) made at the same time. Cat. 74, cat. 75, cat. 76, cat. 77, and cat. 78 closely resemble one another in terms of image size and subject matter, and it is unlikely that Whistler returned to these techniques or themes in mid-1894, when he had just discovered a new, transparent transfer paper and had turned to outdoor, multifigural compositions. Four of these stones remained unprinted during his lifetime (cat. 74, cat. 75, cat. 78, and cat. 80), but it is possible that he thought this image promising enough to ask a Parisian printer to pull a few proofs for him. Whistler could have approached Belfond before their relationship terminated in November 1893, or, alternatively, he might have gone to the Lemercier shop.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (330 \u00d7 203 mm), signed.
