    "copy": " In the Art Institute\u2019s early days, the Buckingham family played a critical role in ensuring the museum\u2019s future. Siblings Clarence Buckingham, Lucy Maud Buckingham, and Kate Sturgis Buckingham each supported the museum: Clarence gifted his collection of 2,500 Japanese prints to the museum in 1914, and sisters Lucy Maud and Kate donated medieval and Asian art and established endowments to support the growth and care of the collection. Over the last century, many more individuals have provided for the museum\u2019s continued strength and excellence with bequests large and small. The Buckingham Society recognizes and honors those who include the Art Institute in their estate plans, thereby carrying on the Buckingham legacy. Buckingham Society members are invited to lectures, receptions, and other behind-the-scenes programs to learn how their commitments support the museum. There is no minimum gift requirement or dues associated with Buckingham Society membership.   Contact Us If you would like to learn more or if you\u2019ve already made the generous decision to include the Art Institute in your estate plans, thank you! You are invited to join fellow donors in the Buckingham Society . Please let us know of your plans so that we can include you in Buckingham Society programs.
