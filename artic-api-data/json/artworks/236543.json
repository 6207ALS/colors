    "description": "<p>Kathe Burkhart is an artist and writer who uses images and text to, in her words, \u201carticulate a radical female subject.\u201d She considers this confrontational, sensual work to be the first fully realized canvas in her Liz Taylor Series, ongoing since 1982. The series of large-scale, richly saturated paintings combines appropriated portraits of actress Elizabeth Taylor (here, a shot of her as Cleopatra, taken by Bert Stern for Vogue magazine in 1962) with profane language, shattering both female stereotypes and conventions of representation. Taylor was a controversial feminist figure throughout her career, conveying equal parts bravura, sexual power, and vulnerability. Burkhart\u2014collapsing the genres of portraiture and self-portraiture\u2014treated the actress as a surrogate figure<br>for her own life in the diary-like narrative series.</p>\n",
