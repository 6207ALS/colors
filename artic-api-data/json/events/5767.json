Densely material, largely reliant on nude models, physically demanding, and bound up in male-dominated and politicized systems of state patronage, sculpture was not considered a polite art,&nbsp;and Claudel\u2019s ambitions in that arena were transgressive. Her work prompted the critic Octave Mirbeau to famously exclaim, \u201cWe are in the presence of something unique, a revolt of nature: a woman genius.\u201d</p><p>Claudel\u2019s sculptures contend with universal themes of love, loss, passion, and the intimacy of daily experience; they embody the artist\u2019s uncompromising pursuit of stylistic and professional independence. Her genius and sensibility are so thoroughly modern that her works continue to resonate, perhaps even more loudly today than during her tumultuous life.</p><p>Simply show your member card or digital member card to enter.</p><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"/events?audience=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more member programs</a>.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong>&nbsp;In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination, though anyone who would like to wear a mask is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 in the week before your visit, we ask that you stay home.&nbsp;We appreciate your help in keeping the museum a healthy and safe place for our staff and visitors.
