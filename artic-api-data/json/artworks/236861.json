    "description": "<p>A pioneering modernist working in Los Angeles from the 1920s until the early 1950s, Knud Merrild believed that avant-garde artists should challenge the boundaries of the picture plane by expanding outward. He assembled <em>Aesthetic Function in Space</em> out of shaped pieces of Masonite, corrugated cardboard, wood, and a small mirror, layering the forms to create a three-dimensional construction that unites elements of painting, collage, and sculpture. Described as being a \u201cspace composition\u201d or \u201cspace painting,\u201d this work is an early American example of a wall construction. It is also the first to be made by any California artist, noteworthy given Merrild\u2019s distance from avant-garde art centers. When exhibited in San Francisco, local critics noted the work\u2019s highly radical form, referring to it as \u201cone of the most ultra of the modern paintings.\u201d</p>\n",
