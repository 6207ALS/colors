    "description": "<p>Ineke Hans\u2019s Black Gold Coffee collection explores the concept of \u201cmodular\u201d porcelain. Starting with the basic technique of \u201cgluing\u201d pieces with slip clay, Hans worked out a modular system that includes just five basic shapes: a narrow cylinder, a medium cylinder, a big cylinder, a corner, and a \u201cplunger.\u201d From these forms, she assembled an entire coffee set, turning the shapes so that they could be used in different ways. For instance, the \u201cplunger\u201d serves as both a cup handle and the spout of a coffee pot. The work is also technically impressive for its successful use of black porcelain, which is difficult to produce because clays that are infused with black pigment tend to be distorted in the kiln when fired.</p>\n",
