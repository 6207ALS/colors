    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This remarkable painting is one of the very earliest known by the Spanish 17th century master Diego Velazquez.  He depicts a woman in a dark interior.  Around her are earthenware bowls and pitchers, a basket hanging on the wall, and a garlic bulb that she is perhaps about to crush in the pestle and mortar beside it.  These objects are ordinary.  They might have been found in any kitchen in the southern Spanish city of Seville, where the young Velazquez was then training as an artist.  But with breathtaking virtuosity, he raises them far above their humble, everyday status.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: What I think is fascinating is that the loving attention that's paid to the sense of texture and what would be the smooth surface of the glaze, in particular, on the pieces of pottery to the left.<br />\nNarrator:  In Seville at this time, bodegones, or still life paintings of kitchen or pantry objects, were popular.  Here, Velazquez seems to be following in that tradition, yet he also includes the woman, probably a Moorish servant, descended from the North African people who inhabited and ruled parts of southern Spain for many centuries.  Velazquez treats this woman, with her thoughtful expression and white sleeve and turban, with the same astonishing and reverent attention to detail and texture as he pays to the still life elements around her.</p>\n",
