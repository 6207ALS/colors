    "description": "<p>Architect and designer Greg Lynn\u2019s flatware for Alessi is a brilliant reinterpretation of the figurative tradition in tableware design. With its sinuous lines, the flatware formally reflects Lynn\u2019s ongoing interest in Art Nouveau and the late-19th-century designs of architect and designer Victor Horta. Beginning with the premise that all flatware is designed from the spoon, Lynn conceived of the cutlery as a kind of genetic system made up of stem, leaf, and flower, and capable of endless variations. Lynn produced the flatware using a three-dimensional digital-printing method and layers of liquid metal. The result is that each piece is figuratively articulated and differentiated from the others with subtle mutations, as the basin and tines of the fork blend in surprising combinations.</p>\n<p>Greg Lynn\u2019s prototype flatware is a brilliant reinterpretation of the figurative tradition found in the design of tableware. Produced with a three-dimensional digital printing method that employs liquid metal, each piece was created by layering liquid forms on top of one another. The cutlery was conceived as a system of stem, leaf, and flower that forms a single setting. Formally, the flatware reflects Lynn\u2019s ongoing interest in Art Nouveau and the craft-laden designs of the architect Victor Horta. Each piece is figuratively articulated and differentiated from the others to reflect its inherent function. Collectively, the flatware presents itself as a selection of unique flowers.</p>\n",
