    "description": "<p>Physically, a Chinese hairpin may not weigh much. Conceptually, however, it carries a lot of weight. As a key piece of ceremonial paraphernalia in the rites of passage toward adulthood, it defines personhood. It signifies class status, as the number of hairpins in an imperial consort\u2019s elaborate headdress would reveal. As a mere ornament, its ostentatious banality may be a far cry from our refined notions of art. At best, it may qualify as a specimen of applied or decorative arts. However, over time, the hairpin came to be conceptualized as an artifact with efficacious properties beyond mere ornamentation. Daoist occultists regard it as a magical wand. Artists encrypt it with poetic conceits. In short, the Chinese hairpin has over time gathered more weight than we can imagine. This lecture unpacks the hefty baggage that has accrued to it. </p><p>Eugene Wang\u2019s extensive publications range from early Chinese art and archeology to modern and contemporary art and cinema.
