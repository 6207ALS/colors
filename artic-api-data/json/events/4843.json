    "description": "<p>Love is all around us! Representations of love abound, in rom-coms, on social media and dating apps, and of course, in music and art. Representations of love belie social, political, cultural and historical narratives that we are performing and aspiring to. Join educators Nancy Chen and Giannella Ysasi to look at the Vignettes series by contemporary artist Kerry James Marshall and consider whether art can help us think critically about human relationships and the concept of love.<strong><br><br></strong>\u201cFrom one side you got the struggle; from the other side you got the aspiration.\u201d<br>\u2013Kerry James Marshall.</p><p><strong><span class=\"ql-cursor\">\ufeff</span></strong>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s wide-ranging collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events.
