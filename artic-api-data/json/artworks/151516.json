After his discharge in 1952, he began to pursue art, earning his BFA from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1954. Using art as an outlet to express his concerns with the environment and human folly, the artist created obsessively crafted sculptural tableaux, prints, and drawings. <em>Central America</em> features a self-portrait and could be a commentary on his own artistic \u201chunt\u201d for the exotic.</p>\n",
