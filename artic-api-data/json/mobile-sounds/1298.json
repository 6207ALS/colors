    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Chinese art was all the rage in early eighteenth century England where its imagery was found to combine elegance with a certain air of mysterious exotic charm. Chinese ceramics and wallpapers were avidly collected but a growing market also developed for objects produced in England in the Chinese style. Made around 1735 this desk is entirely English in form with its drawers and bookcase crowned by a broken pediment with classical urns. But its flamboyant decorative scheme clearly draws on Chinese techniques and imagery. Its surface is covered with an English version of glossy red lacquer. Against this background East Asian inspired figures, animals and flora are rendered in tones of silver and gold that would have glowed under candlelight. The large figures of a graceful Chinese lady and gentleman on the inside of the cabinet\u2019s upper doors are especially well preserved. They would usually have been revealed only to the eyes of the cabinet\u2019s owner when seated at the desk or pulling a book from its upper stories.</p>\n",
