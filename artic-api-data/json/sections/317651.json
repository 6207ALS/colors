Another (cat. 84), drawn on thin, transparent transfer paper and printed by Lemercier, had been unsatisfactory. Still eager to have a reproduction by his own hand published in the Gazette des beaux-arts, Whistler turned to a more familiar material, fine-grained transfer paper (papier viennois), and to his London printers, the Ways.\n\nWhistler sent this \u201csketch impression\u201d of the Montesquiou portrait to the Ways to be transferred and printed (letter 89). In a letter of July 13, he emphasized that this image was \u201cmost important\u201d; he revealed to T. R. Way that he had been infuriated by Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s etching (fig. 85a) but not that he had already attempted to produce a lithograph with Lemercier. Optimistic that the new drawing on papier viennois would transfer well, he instructed the Ways to make six transfers to supplementary stones for the periodical edition, so as to protect the original stone from wear. Despite the presence of some delicate stump work in the drawing, he expected the image to print \u201cmost mysteriously rich\u201d (letter 92).\n\nTwo days later, however, when Whistler received the first proofs of the Montesquiou lithograph, he was bitterly disappointed. He declared in a letter to T. R. Way: \u201cThe portrait is damnable!\u2014I dont mean the printing which is even as good as the thing to be printed was bad! . . . No, my drawing or sketch . . . is damnable\u2014and no more like the superb original than if it had been done by my worst and most competent enemy!\u201d He ordered the Ways to cancel the stone immediately and to send him the proofs they had pulled of the image, including one from the destroyed stone, so \u201cthat I may myself burn all.\u201d He made it clear that he did not want this lithograph recorded in the catalogue T. R. Way was preparing, and ended the discussion with the words \u201clet us never remember this foolish business of the portrait.\u201d He seems to have reconciled himself somewhat to the idea that a professional engraver would make the reproduction for the Gazette des beaux-arts after all, mentioning that William Brassey Hole had been approached to do the job and quipping \u201cI wish him joy!\u201d (letter 93).\n\nGlasgow: HAG, impression from canceled stone on grayish ivory wove proofing paper (286 \u00d7 224 mm) (fig. 85b). London: BM, cream Japanese vellum (302 \u00d7 221 mm). Washington: FGA, cream wove Japanese vellum (312 \u00d7 231 mm), signed; LC cream wove Japanese vellum (311 \u00d7 231 mm). The impression in the Library of Congress bears a stamp on the verso indicating that it was a part of T. R. Way\u2019s collection; clearly, the printer did not return every impression to the artist.\n\nRemarks: Another impression of this rare lithograph is found in Boston, BPL.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K. Stratis, Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See also Whistler to Thomson, [10 August 1894], LCPC box 3. Hole never produced a reproduction for the French periodical, and Whistler apparantly did not manage to provide a clich\u00e9 verre or photograph for a relief halftone. The Gazette des beaux-arts eventually did publish Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s etching after Whistler\u2019s death; see cat. 84, esp. n. 4.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 85, only state.
