    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator, Rebecca Long.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: So the painting shown here is actually not intended to be an independent painting but was rather part of a piece of furniture that would\u2019ve been functional decoration as a storage unit.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator, Martha Wolf.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: So they tell a story, in this case, of faithfulness, marital virtue.  Ulysses goes off to the Trojan War.  After the Trojan War, he comes back and has a very, very hard time getting home, and the images are of his adventures with the giant Polyphemus, for instance, on the left.  The sirens are circling the ship on which Ulysses is tied to the mast in order to resist their siren call.  Many, many stories arrayed kind of in comic book fashion, and you\u2019re helped to understand them by little labels that identify the characters.  You can look for those closely and it also culminates in the story of Ulysses\u2019 homecoming at the upper right.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: So the story of Ulysses\u2019 faithful wife Penelope in the upper sort of center right and you see her inside and she\u2019s weaving at a loom.  Outside of the building are the suitors that come and, as the story said, she would undo her weaving every night.  As long as the project was unfinished she was not committing to any of their attentions and she was remaining faithful to her husband Ulysses, and that\u2019s how it fits into this idea of wifely virtue that was relevant in Florence in the Renaissance period.</p>\n",
