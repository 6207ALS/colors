The Buckingham siblings\u2014Clarence, Lucy Maud, and Kate Sturgis\u2014each&nbsp;supported the museum in their own way: Clarence gifted his 2,500 Japanese&nbsp;prints in 1914, and Lucy Maud and Kate donated artworks and established endowments to support the collection\u2019s growth and care. Since then, many more individuals have provided for the museum\u2019s continued strength and excellence with bequests of all sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>Support from Buckingham Society members helps ensure visitors of all ages and backgrounds have access to everything the museum offers. </p>",
