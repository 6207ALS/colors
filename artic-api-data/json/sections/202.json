His understanding of color and its constituent parts in achieving an overall effect developed over the years, as an 1886 novel by Paul Adam entitled Soi attests. The book tells the story of a bearded artist named Vibrac who, it is now generally assumed, was modeled after Pissarro, based on his appearance and approach to image making. Adam focused not only on this fictionalized artist\u2019s color aesthetic, but also on his particular rendering of snow, as in this passage:\n\nWinter had come . . . . The painter wished to undertake some studies of snow. He set himself up on the veranda with his brushes and tubes of paint. Marthe sat next to him and conversed as he worked. . . . The weather was horrible: A mix of rain and heavy snow flakes whirled noisily outside . . . . The young woman delighted in watching the artist apply his colors with a knife in large slabs in his display of artistic skill . . . . During this period, however, the artist seemed to alter his approach, applying multiple strokes and thick blotches with his brush as it directed the lilac and blue shadows onto his canvas . . . . This is how he created the effect of snow, where barely visible were two white lines lost amidst layers of pink, lilac, violet and gray . . . .  \n\u2014That is a rich exaggeration!, said Marthe. First of all, snow is white!  \n\u2014Never! When I look at snow, I see pinks and lilacs in the shadows, and these shades are everywhere. True, there is a bit of white, over there at the top, and so there you go, I also added in some white.\n\nMonet had already mastered the colors of white for his renderings of the snowy landscape, with its blue and purple shadows and subtle pastel tints, and was, perhaps, the instigator of his older friend\u2019s first forays into snow in winter 1869\u201370, when the two artists painted together. Indeed, Monet even trudged up the hill from Bougival, where he lived, to Pissarro\u2019s house in Louveciennes (fig. 3.1) to paint snow effects. Pissarro made at least eight effets de neige that winter, of which the present work is unique in being painted on panel rather than lighter stretched canvas.\n\nThe Pissarro family had arrived in Louveciennes in spring 1869, and it is likely that they made the move from Pontoise, north of Paris, to this western suburb because Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley were either already there or shortly to arrive. Berthe Morisot and Edgar Degas also made the pilgrimage to Louveciennes, making it the only area where virtually all of the Impressionists resided at the same time. Pissarro undoubtedly saw the extraordinary \u201cside-by-side\u201d canvases made by Monet and Renoir in the summer of 1869 at La Grenouill\u00e8re, the well-known bathing establishment on the Seine near Bougival. It was, perhaps, in that spirit that he painted snowy landscapes with Monet; this kind of painterly competition (see fig. 3.2 and fig. 3.3 [PDRS 138]) helped each artist define his own unique sensibility in front of the same landscape motif.\n\nSnow at Louveciennes has no cognate in Monet\u2019s career and seems to have been a \u201cone-off\u201d experiment, painted directly by Pissarro on top of an already-completed vertical landscape with two figures, traces of which can be found beneath (fig. 3.4; see Paint Layer in the technical report). These suggest that the earlier landscape was a summer or fall painting, the bottom of which was transformed into the right side of the present work. Indeed, hints of the green vegetation can be glimpsed amid the twists of snow-covered foliage in this area (fig. 3.5). The vertical landscape itself was painted on top of yet another picture, a horizontal landscape that was mostly scraped away by the artist. This would make the present work the third one that Pissarro painted on the same wooden support. Two other panel paintings from the same season are known, but only from old black-and-white photographs, their support indicated by the artist\u2019s son Ludovic-Rodo. Pissarro commonly chose wooden supports in the early and mid-1860s but did so less frequently later in the decade.\n\nFrom the technical evidence discovered by the Art Institute about the present work, it is possible to imagine that upon seeing deep snow accumulate outside his window, Pissarro grabbed an existing painting that he deemed unsuccessful and rushed outside to capture the novel effects. In other words, he chose not to experiment on a relatively expensive pre-primed canvas but to test himself on a new subject without financial risk. Rather than paint directly in front of his house, which was on a busy street, Pissarro took the panel, his paint box, and an easel to a landscape a short walk away. Based on a gouache by his friend Ludovic Piette, it is not difficult to imagine that with the right equipment (minus the umbrella) Pissarro very possibly could have painted outdoors. This type of painter\u2019s gear was not uncommon, and all Pissarro would have really required was a warm coat (fig. 3.6).\n\nThe physical evidence of the picture itself suggests that Snow at Louveciennes was probably painted in one sitting and signed while still tacky. The painter worked in the landscape under heavy cloud cover, possibly even while it snowed, and, for that reason, was able to depict a motif with complex overlays of branches without the added interference of shadows. He had already painted the same landscape from the same vantage point in fall 1869, and was thus able to transcribe the optical effects of snow without thinking very much about the composition. The earlier painting, The Brook at Montbuisson, Louveciennes (fig. 3.7 [PDRS 136]), was also painted over another work, in this case a portrait, suggesting that Pissarro\u2019s economic difficulties forced him to reuse earlier works that remained unsold. This makes clear that Pissarro\u2019s early experiments with small-scale \u201cimpressions\u201d in the manner of Monet and Renoir were just that\u2014experiments. Yet this exploration was further developed into an aesthetic and became the essence of the Impressionsts\u2019 new practice.\n\nThat very experimental quality and the fact that it was probably painted in one sitting make this one of Pissarro\u2019s earliest attempts at the kind of direct painting about which Jules Laforgue wrote so eloquently in 1883. We know that Pissarro had painted snow effects in 1869 because his earliest datable effet de neige was sold on January 7, 1870, to the American art dealer George A. Lucas (fig. 3.3). Thus, it is likely that Snow in Louveciennes predates that work. The snow scene purchased by Lucas is very similar to a work that postdates the present panel, featuring the same composition and almost the same viewing angle; entitled Versailles Road, Louveciennes (fig. 3.8 [PDRS 151]), it was likely painted in the spring, as signs of life are present in the surrounding vegetation. Both the winter and spring versions of this work (fig. 3.3 and fig. 3.8) seem to be calculated views with strong angles and perspectives, much like the other winter scenes that Pissarro depicted during this period, almost all featuring roads, rows of houses, and people.\n\nFurthermore, that Pissarro painted the same location earlier, in The Brook at Montbuisson, Louveciennes, makes it even more plausible that his Louveciennes winter panel was his first depiction of winter. The artist may have wanted to record the effects of the first snowfall in an area not very frequented by pedestrians, unlike the road to Versailles in Louveciennes, which he depicted several times and under different weather conditions. This work may thus represent an attempt by Pissarro to record a winter landscape free of the symmetry of a road and the perspective offered by residential structures. It is one of the few true \u201cimpressions\u201d of the painter\u2019s career.\n\nWhat is most perplexing about the present work is that, despite the fact that its authenticity is uncontested, it has no known provenance before its acquisition by Paul Rosenberg, reputedly from an art acquisitions syndicate, and its sale to the Art Institute in 1973. In spite of the meticulous records kept by Ludovic-Rodo, this painting fell through the cracks. This suggests that it was acquired during Pissarro\u2019s lifetime by a collector, possibly even as a gift from the painter, thus eluding any record keeping that would have accompanied a sale through one of Pissarro\u2019s known dealers.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro used this small, unprimed oak panel at least twice before painting the current composition. The earliest composition appears to have been a horizontally oriented grassy landscape, and the remains of bright blue throughout the top half, and muted greens throughout the lower half, can still be seen in skips in the upper paint layers. The artist scraped almost all of this first landscape away before turning the panel clockwise to begin a vertical composition. The second use of this panel depicts two figures on a dark-green foreground standing before a diagonal wall or structure right of center; there appears to be a hill and possibly a small tan-colored building at left. The sky in this composition is a very pale gray, almost white, and heavily textured.\n\nWithout scraping or painting out the second landscape with figures, Pissarro rotated the panel back to its original horizontal orientation to begin the visible landscape. He first executed a contour sketch in fluid black paint to delineate the major forms in the lower half. The artist then began painting the tree trunks and branches in brownish-red paint and laid in some tans and browns for the central building, the hills in the distance, and the walls at left. At this point Pissarro partially scraped the panel again, removing many of the thicker ridges of paint from the second composition but keeping it mostly intact, and leaving residues of the initial layers of the third landscape in the interstices of the paint strokes. This is especially prevalent throughout the left half of the work and in the foreground. The visible composition was constructed from dark to light, with the trees, foreground structures, and small figure at right indicated before the artist brought in the heavy white paint for the snow. Late in the process, Pissarro made the overcast sky slightly bluer and added the thickest layers in the foreground before signing the work, wet-in-wet, at the lower right. The painting is currently varnished; the lower edge was cut unevenly at an unknown date and the panel cradled.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 3.9).\n\nSigned: C. Pissarro (lower right, in brown-black paint) (fig. 3.10).\n\nThe signature was executed wet-in-wet with the upper layers of the background (fig. 3.11).\n\nAlthough the bottom edge appears to have been cut, the original size of the panel was likely close to its largest measurements (at left): 32.3 \u00d7 47.2 cm. This is closest to a no. 8 landscape vertical (paysage basse) standard-size (46 \u00d7 32.5 cm) canvas.\n\nThe support is a single, horizontal-format wood panel with a vertical grain. Thickness: 0.5 cm.\n\nOak (estimated).\n\nTangential.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nIt is not immediately clear whether there is a ground layer. In stereomicroscopic examination, bare wood is occasionally visible, and some of the earliest paint layers appear as though they were applied directly on the panel (fig. 3.12). But examination and analysis of cross sections from two, or possibly three, disparate areas reveals a very thin, intermittent, highly pigmented layer of variable composition apparently unrelated to any of the three painted compositions. The thinness of this layer and its dark tonality suggest that if it is a preparation, it may have functioned primarily as a sealing and toning layer.\n\nThe lowest layer is virtually invisible in stereomicroscopic examination of the surface, but appears brown or brownish-red in cross sections (fig. 3.13).\n\nWhere thick enough to be analyzed, the brown layer closest to the wood is primarily a mixture of lead white and iron-oxide earths, such as red, yellow, and brown, with some bone black, silica, barium sulfate, and various aluminosilicates. While similar in their main components, the samples differ in their minor ingredients: in one sample, small amounts of ultramarine blue were also detected, while in another, umber- and chrome-based pigments, emerald green, and additional calcium compounds including chalk were observed.\n\nAs there is evidence of multiple compositions on this support, in addition to scraping back of earlier compositions by the artist, evidence of underdrawing is not consistent. It does appear that Pissarro outlined some of the major contours of each of the landscapes (fig. 3.14).\n\nWhere visible, the underdrawing appears to have been executed in dark, possibly black, paint.\n\nPissarro executed at least three different compositions on this panel, and evidence of underdrawing is intermittent. In what is visible of these landscapes, no changes are apparent within the compositional planning stages. (See Paint Layer.)\n\nThe artist reused this support at least twice, beginning with what appears to be a horizontal composition. Remnants of bright blue can be seen along the edges and in skips in the brushwork throughout the top half (fig. 3.15), while a muted, light green seen above the center of the panel hints at a grassy landscape (fig. 3.16). These greens and blues appear intermittent in stereomicroscopic examination, and the X-ray and raking light images confirm that the artist scraped most of this work back before turning the panel clockwise to begin a second composition in a vertical orientation.\n\nThe second composition, a vertical landscape with two figures, appears to feature dark greens and browns in the foreground; these tones are still visible amid the branches and snow banks in the visible composition, especially at the upper right and along the bottom edge (fig. 3.17 and fig. 3.18). Forms seen in the infrared image begin to make sense with the panel in this vertical orientation: two figures are located right of center standing next to a post or tree while a low dark-brown wall or structure juts in behind them from the right edge (fig. 3.19). These figures appear to be facing the viewer, and hints of their flesh tones are still visible amid the branches in this area (fig. 3.20). Forms seen in the X-ray image also suggest a possible third figure at the left, in front of a square structure or second wall.\n\nThis landscape was configured so that the horizon line was located between one third and halfway up the panel. The X-ray also shows a hill rising from the center of the left edge, and another rectilinear structure, perhaps the side of a building or another wall, just above it. The upper edge of this structure is visible under the microscope and was a tan or light-brown color (fig. 3.21). The rest of the panel was thickly painted in a very light gray; this color serves as the base of the sky throughout the left half of the third and final composition.\n\nWithout scraping or painting out the second composition, Pissarro reoriented the panel back to the original horizontal to begin the visible composition. It appears that he started this composition with a contour sketch in fluid, black painted lines; then laid in thin, flat layers of brown and tan for the structure left of center, the hills in the distance, and the walls; and then indicated some of the branches and tree trunks in reddish-brown. In the upper right quadrant, these tree branches are seen directly on top of the dark green from the underlying landscape, with dabs of pale bluish-gray added between branches for the sky. This area of the painting in particular displays evidence of a complicated back-and-forth way of working as the artist painted branches, then painted pale grays and ivories in between to blot out the dark green below, followed by more branches and additional sky (fig. 3.17). At some point in the early stages of this third composition, Pissarro scraped back the painting again. This scraping seems to have been aimed at leveling the heavily textured paint layers from the second composition, and is especially concentrated at the left and throughout the foreground. Unlike the earlier campaign, in which the artist scraped most of the paint from the panel, here only the high points and ridges were removed. The result is a complicated layered structure with the textured paint from the second composition exposed and leveled, and the initial outlines and thinly painted preliminary layers of the third composition sitting in the interstices and depressions of the earlier brushstrokes.\n\nFrom here, the artist painted out some of these initial forms and enhanced others, as in the tree branches above center (fig. 3.22). The sequence of events is often obscured in areas where the added layers are also thin, and settle preferentially into the now shallow depressions in the paint layer (fig. 3.23). Pissarro moved from dark to light, laying in many of the dark tones, including the small figure at right, before layering the thick whites and pale tones of the snow throughout the foreground and on top of tree branches and structures (fig. 3.24). Toward the end of the painting process, he slightly enhanced the color of the sky, adding a more bluish pale gray over the almost-white initial sky. At left, this paler inital sky was left over from the second composition, while at right, it was a series of pale grays added between some branches to obscure the dark colors of the second composition. The artist added this bluer sky color between branches where possible; there is, however, a kind of halo effect around some branches where the cooler, bluer paint is thinner or absent (see fig. 3.25). Pissarro also went back in to reinforce some of the smaller branches wet-in-wet with this layer. The bluer highlights of the foreground may also have been executed in a later layer, and the artist signed the work wet-in-wet with the snow at the lower right. Small horizontal indentations along the top and bottom of the visible composition occurred while the paint was still soft and may indicate that the artist was painting on a field easel or mobile easel.\n\nMostly flat, with some round soft- and medium-bristle brushes, with strokes up to 1.0 cm (the second composition features strokes up to 2 cm wide); palette knife for scraping.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white; zinc white; cobalt blue; ultramarine blue; Prussian blue; bone black; viridian; emerald green; vermilion; red lake; iron-oxide red, yellow, and brown; umber; chrome yellow; and chrome orange.\n\nExamination of cross sections suggests, perhaps not surprisingly, a complicated layer structure with complex pigment mixtures. A sample from the bottom edge of the composition contains as many as seven different layers (fig. 3.26). It is unclear if the lowest layer of this sample is a preparatory layer or the foreground of the first composition (see Preparatory Layers). Above this brownish-green paint, however, are various pale blues, gray-blues, and cool whites, some applied wet-in-wet, that use similar pigments in varying proportions to modulate both the sky of the second composition and the snowy foreground of the visible landscape. These layers incorporate varying proportions of lead white, ultramarine blue, and bone black. The uppermost white layer is primarily lead white with some vermilion.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an overall synthetic varnish with residues of an older, natural-resin varnish in the depressions of the paint layer.\n\nThe work was treated in 1974; pretreatment condition notes indicate the panel had a vertical split approximately one-third from the left that was secured by a cradle (fig. 3.27). During this treatment a discolored natural-resin varnish was removed, along with extensive overpaint. Once cleaned, the painting was given three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, retouching, and finally AYAA).\n\nThe panel support is cradled with nine vertical (along-the-grain) fixed members and four moveable horizontal members that are currently jammed. The panel has an overall convex warp and an older vertical split approximately one third from the left that is secured by the cradle and remains stable at this time. The shortening of the panel along the lower edge appears to predate the cradle. There are numerous abrasions from the frame rebate and losses along the perimeter, many of which are inpainted; the vertical split also has older, retouched losses. There is an overall, semi-gloss synthetic varnish.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, 1970/80 stylization of a Louis XVI, Neoclassical frame with bound fasces rails, a leaf-tip sight molding, and an independent linen-covered liner. The frame has water and oil gilding over red-brown bole on gesso. The gilding is heavily rubbed on the ornament and rails and toned overall. The machine-carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed, and glued to a butt-jointed back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; ovolo with running ovate; scotia side; torus with bound fasces; scotia; astragal; fillet; ogee with leaf-tip ornament; fillet with beveled sight edge; and an independent fillet with beveled, linen-covered liner (fig. 3.28).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from [unknown] by a private collector, Paris.\n\nAcquired by Sarec, S.A., Switzerland, by Dec. 1972.\n\nSold by Sarec, S.A., Switzerland, to Paul Rosenberg &amp; Company, New York, Dec. 1972.\n\nSold by Paul Rosenberg &amp; Company, New York, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1973.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Washington, D.

La jeune femme s\u2019amusa au spectacle de l\u2019artiste posant des tons au couteau par larges plaques . . . . Mais, \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque, il parut changer sa mani\u00e8re. Son pinceau s\u2019appuyait en multiples et \u00e9paisses maculatures, et portait des ombres mauves ou bleues . . . . Ainsi composa-t-il un effet de neige o\u00f9 se montraient \u00e0 peine deux lignes blanches perdues dans des encro\u00fbtements roses, mauves, violets et gris . . . .  \n\u2014 Oh! Vous exag\u00e9rez joliment. Et puis, d\u2019abord, la neige est blanche.  \n\u2014 Jamais de la vie. Je la vois rose, je la vois mauve dans ses ombres, et il y a de l\u2019ombre partout. Oui, c\u2019est un peu blanc, l\u00e0-haut: eh bien, je l\u2019ai fait.\u201d  \nPaul Adam, Soi (Tresse et Stock, 1886), pp. 215\u201321.

Pissarro used a canvas with an unusual weave\u2014a chevron or herringbone twill that runs horizontally\u2014for L\u2019Hermitage at Pontoise (1867; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum, Cologne [PDRS 119]). This picture was executed over a previous painting as well, as were The Banks of Marne in Winter (1866; cat. 2) and Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8). For details on L\u2019Hermitage at Pontoise, see Anthea Callen, Techniques of the Impressionists (Chartwell, 2001), pp. 46\u201347. See also PDRS, vol. 2, p. 111.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 124, 136, cats. 132, 150 (ills.). The works are entitled La Machine de Marly \u00e0 Bougival (c. 1869; current location unknown) and Farrier\u2019s House, Louveciennes (c. 1870; private collection). It is indicated next to both PDRS 132 and 150 that Ludovic-Rodo knew these works.\n\nCanvas\u2014pre-primed and woven\u2014eventually replaced the wood panel as the Impressionists\u2019 choice of support. See Anthea Callen, Techniques of the Impressionists (Chartwell, 2001), pp. 58\u201359, for the mahogany wood panel likely used by Pissarro for the Art Institute\u2019s painting.\n\nSee Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 128. For Pissarro\u2019s and others\u2019 painting with gadgets such as umbrellas placed on easels and paint boxes, see pp. 128\u201329. A circa 1874 photograph of Paul C\u00e9zanne and Pissarro setting off with their painting gear strapped to their backs in Pontoise appears on p. 128.

In a December 1882 letter to Charles \u00c9phrussi, the poet Jules Laforgue wrote about seeing Pissarro\u2019s and other Impressionist works at the gallery of Fritz Gurlitt.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 128\u201332, cats.138\u201342, 144\u201345 (ills.).\n\nSadly, there are no labels or other marks on the panel that help in the identification of an early owner or even an exhibition before its acquisition by Rosenberg (see Other Documentation).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests the signature paint is a mixture containing predominantly black and iron-oxide yellow and/or brown. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d June 28, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRounded edges are present at the top corners and partially at the lower left, suggesting the height along the left side is very close to the original height. Although not currently visible due to subsequent retouching, small, jagged paint losses along the bottom edge are visible in the X-ray image. These losses, along with the sharp corner at the lower right, suggest the panel was trimmed unevenly along the lower edge, leaving more of the original at the left and trimming as much as a centimeter from the right. The date and reason for this adjustment are unknown at this time.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Lefranc et Cie in 1889, reproduced in Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 15, fig. 24. See also the range of canvases offered in 1863, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 45, fig. 30.\n\nWood visually identified by Kirk Vuillemot, Art Institute of Chicago, Assistant Conservator for Preparation and Framing, July 10, 2013.\n\nCross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the panel and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Oct. 6, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA third sample showed possible evidence of this layer, but the presence cannot be confirmed. At this time it cannot be excluded that these areas may be representative of the beginnings of a painted sketch or fourth composition. In one sample from the lower edge of the panel, this brown could be related to the first, mostly scraped-down composition, but this cannot be confirmed at this time. If this was an intended preparatory layer, the inclusion of small amounts of more expensive artist\u2019s pigments usually reserved for surface painting may indicate that this layer contains palette scrapings, residues of paint left on the brush, or other studio debris.\n\nThe composition of this brown layer was analyzed using SEM/EDX. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Oct. 6, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that the very thin brown layer found as the lowest in two, possibly three, cross sections may be the beginnings of a fourth composition, and not a preparatory layer. In one sample from the lower edge of the panel, the brown layer may be related to the first, mostly scraped-down, horizontal landscape, although this cannot be confirmed at this time. See Ground.\n\nFor a discussion of plein air painting and Pissarro\u2019s use of mobile and field easels, see Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), pp. 78\u201381.\n\nPigments, as identified by the techniques that follow: lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, iron containing pigments (Prussian blue, earths, and umber), vermilion, chrome yellow, chrome orange, viridian, emerald green (XRF, SEM/EDX); ultramarine blue, bone black, red lake (SEM/EDX). See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d June 28, 2013; and Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Oct. 6, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nIt is possible that this painting contains the lead white and zinc white mixture found in other Pissarro works from the 1870s and 1880s. Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture was found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. This mixture was also identified in The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat.8), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12), and The Place du Havre (1893; cat. 13).\n\nAluminum, sulfur, calcium, and tin were identified by EDS as possible components of the lake\u2019s substrate. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_SnowLouveciennes\\_1973\\_673\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Oct. 6, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings.
