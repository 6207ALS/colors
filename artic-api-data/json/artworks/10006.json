    "description": "<p>Starting in 96 with the reign of Emperor Nerva, Rome was ruled by five wise leaders who came to be known as the \u201cGood Emperors.\u201d Nerva (reigned 96\u201398) was an honest and respected senator who enacted compassionate social programs. His rule ushered in a period of peace and prosperity, which is suggested by the sheer abundance of coins produced during this era as well as by the skill and artistry of the images created. Coins of this period, especially gold aurei like this one, were often perfectly round, well struck, and centered.</p>\n<p>Antoninus Pius (reigned 138\u201361), continued the wise and caring example of Nerva which is reflected in his nickname, Pius, meaning \u201cpious.\u201d Able to maintain peace through the strength of the Army, Rome was strong and prosperous under Antoninus\u2019s firm rule.</p>\n",
