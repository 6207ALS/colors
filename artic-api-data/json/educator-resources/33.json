    "copy": " In this work, Chicago-based artist Archibald J. Motley, Jr. depicts himself as a debonair yet serious artist, vibrant palette in hand. The traditional composition and lively colors that hint of his future Bronzeville paintings offer a glimpse into the complexity of Motley himself. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
