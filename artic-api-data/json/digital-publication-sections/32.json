Every effort has been made to identify, contact, and acknowledge copyright holders for all reproductions; additional rights holders are encouraged to contact the Art Institute of Chicago. All contributions were peer reviewed via one of two models: double-anonymized review , which maintains strict anonymity between contributor(s) and reviewer (the traditional model), and open review (or mentored review), which permits direct interaction between contributor and reviewer. The \u201cHow to Cite\u201d section at the bottom of every contribution to the Perspectives titles indicates which type of peer review a particular contribution received. Perspectives on Data grew out of conversations about new models for museum publishing conducted by a team within the Art Institute of Chicago (initially led by Joseph Mohan, Greg Nosan, and Amy R. Peltz) and a group of advisors from both within and outside the museum. We gratefully acknowledge their contributions.
