    "copy": " This two-volume study presents the lithographic work of James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834-1903) in thorough technical and contextual detail. Volume I, a catalogue raisonn\u00e9, contains entries for each of Whistler's 179 lithographs, and is illustrated with reproductions of near-facsimile quality. The essays situate Whistler's work in lithography within a broader art-historical context. Volume II features transcriptions of more than 170 letters exchanged between Whistler and his London printers, Thomas Way and T. R. Way. Also included are a discussion of Whistler's lithographic techniques and an illustrated chronological account of the artist's marketing strategies. A compilation of watermarks reproduces at actual size those found in lithographs printed in Whistler's lifetime and posthumously. The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler constitutes an important contribution to Whistler studies and to the study of nineteenth-century printmaking.
