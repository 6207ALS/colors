(sheet)  \nBequest of Bryan Lathrop, 1934.681\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">This drawing of Herbert Charles Pollitt, made for transfer onto a lithographic stone, exemplifies the confident, abbreviated linear style associated with James McNeill Whistler\u2019s mature work in lithography. With characteristic finesse, Whistler\u2019s crayon outlines the chair, coat, and seated figure in sinuous strokes, while softly blended diagonal shading brings volume to the forms. His restrained handling exploits the distinctive surface properties of the papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, which the artist began to use in 1894 and prized for the velvety quality it gave to his lithographic drawings. Thomas R. Way, who together with his father, Thomas Way, printed the majority of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, noted that the glassy surface of this type of transfer paper at times produced a blurred effect. In the area of the sitter\u2019s head in particular, the features are so soft that they appear as if they have been breathed onto the paper, rather than drawn.\n\nThe dandyish nonchalance of the figure\u2019s pose, slightly slouched with crossed legs thrust outward, bespeaks the personality of the sitter. When he posed for the portrait, Pollitt (who sometimes went by the nickname \u201cJerome\u201d) was a master\u2019s student at the University of Cambridge in England. There, he had distinguished himself as an adherent to the principles of both the Aesthetic and Decadent movements, exalting sensuous experience and artificiality in both life and art. The walls of his rooms at Trinity College were adorned with works by Whistler, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Pollitt\u2019s good friend Aubrey Beardsley, and he counted Oscar Wilde among his correspondents. A photograph taken of him by Frederick Evans around two years before he sat for Whistler reflects a demeanor as relaxed as the one captured in the drawing (fig. 37.1).\n\nThrough mutual contacts at the Fine Art Society in London, a gallery that maintained close ties to the artist, Pollitt commissioned Whistler in 1896 to make a lithographic portrait. That year Whistler undertook several other portraits in lithography of friends and patrons (see, for example, Study for Portrait of Thomas Way, cat. 38), and in January even considered advertising his services as a lithographic portraitist through the gallery to drum up interest. According to correspondence between Whistler and Marcus Bourne Huish, the society\u2019s director, Pollitt posed for Whistler in John Singer Sargent\u2019s studio on Fulham Road in early February. A completed lithograph showing Pollitt standing, one arm covered by an overcoat similar to the one shown in the Art Institute drawing, was transferred to stone a few days later (fig. 37.2; [Way 117]). Whistler also commenced an oil painting of Pollitt, which he worked on sporadically over the next year but never completed. In 1900 he halted the effort and returned a cash advance for the portrait to the Fine Art Society. The painting was ultimately destroyed.\n\nThe Art Institute drawing was never transferred to a stone and consequently did not become a lithographic print. There are several possible explanations for Whistler\u2019s decision not to carry the work forward. Margaret MacDonald judges the handling to be indecisive in some places, and the pose awkward. The drawing may thus have been set aside as an early attempt to work out the composition. Another possible explanation, advanced by Britt Salvesen, Harriet Stratis, and Martha Tedeschi, is that Whistler and the Ways decided that the image was unlikely to transfer well since papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal has a short life span, and that this sheet, which likely came from an earlier supply provided to him by the French printer Alfred Lemercier, may have been too degraded. Indeed, in 1896 Whistler\u2019s supply of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal had dwindled, and he abandoned it almost entirely in favor of a new grained transfer paper supplied to him by the Ways. It may also simply have come down to bad timing\u2013\u2013the drawing was completed around the time Whistler\u2019s wife, Beatrice, was dying of cancer, and the artist was understandably preoccupied. By the time he returned to the sheet, the already deteriorating papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, if not already too old when he drew on it, may have become unviable in the interim. The paper as it appears today is creased in several places and torn along one edge, an indication of its delicacy and susceptibility to damage.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">H.
