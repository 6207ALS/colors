Clarkson highlighted the rich blue and gold of the garments by positioning Dzeron against an unadorned background with strong lighting reminiscent of Spanish Baroque painter Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and French realist \u00c9douard Manet. Clarkson was part of Chicago\u2019s artistic community, establishing a studio in the city in 1896, active in several local arts organizations, and teaching at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n",
