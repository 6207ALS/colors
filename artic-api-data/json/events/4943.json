During this 6-week class, we'll explore how the size of an artwork influences the experience and process of drawing. How does it feel to draw from a monumental painting onto a small sheet of paper? Or to sketch a tiny object larger than it actually is? Draw from the museum's collection and see how different sizes demand different techniques. Explore the relationship between the size and meaning as you experiment with shifts in scale.</p><p>This class is for people ages 16 and up. All materials will be provided.</p>",
