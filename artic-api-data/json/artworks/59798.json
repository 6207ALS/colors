    "description": "<p>This female angel is one of many that Abbott Handerson Thayer painted during his career. Originally a painter of animals, Thayer created portraits and then allegorical figures like this example after training in Paris. The artist wrote of his seraphic subjects, \u201cI have put on wings probably more to symbolize an exalted atmosphere . . . where one need not explain the action of his figures.\u201d Other late 19th-century artists such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36518\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a> also represented angelic female figures to personify what they perceived as the virtues of women. In <em>Winged Figure</em>, Thayer mixed this idealism with a level of naturalism, particularizing the woman\u2019s features and giving her form a sense of mass and gravity.</p>\n",
