The traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left bear witness to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s changing opinion as he struggled to make the composition work.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;6.375 x 4.4375 in.</li><li><strong>Full Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp; 8 x 10 in.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Materials:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Premium cardstock</li></ul>",
