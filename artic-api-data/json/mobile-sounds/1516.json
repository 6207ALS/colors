    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The term &quot;girandoles&quot; may not be familiar today, but it's simply a group of matched candleholders designed to stand in front of a mirror. Usually on a mantle shelf, so their light reflects back into the room. This set was produced around 1850, from a patented design by Cornelius and Company, the largest maker of girandoles in America. The factory in Philadelphia employed hundreds of workers and covered five floors. In these girandoles the prisms are cut glass, the bases are marble, and the figures are cast in bronze and gilded. In their style and materials, and even in the poses of the figures, they reflect the fashionable taste for the classical sculptures of Greece or Rome. The people shown here however, are not ancient gods, they're characters from James Fenimore Cooper's novel, The Last of the Mohicans, a late of adventure set during the French and Indian wars. At the center of the group here, we see the brave frontiersman, Nathaniel Bumppo, also known as &quot;Hawkeye,&quot; sitting on a fallen log. Beside him, gesturing like an ancient statue of Zeus and wearing what looks like a toga, is the chief of the Mohicans. His son, Uncas, stands behind them. The single figures off to either side, are the lovely and imperiled Cora Munro, and the heroic Major Heyward.</p>\n",
