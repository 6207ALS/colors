Beginning in June 1889 and lasting until the summer of 1890, Monet was thoroughly focused on helping to raise money for the purchase of \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Olympia (1863; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris) from the artist\u2019s widow on behalf of the French nation. The Art Institute\u2019s Poppy Field (Giverny) is one of four nearly identical pictures undertaken in July 1890 (fig. 26.1 [W1251], fig. 26.2 [W1252], and Poppies, 1890/91; private collection [W1254]) that together mark his return to work. The poppy group is one of three groups of paintings with similar subjects from this period. Showing fields of poppies, oats, or hay (e.g., fig. 26.3 [W1247] and fig. 26.4 [W1259]) behind Monet\u2019s house at Giverny, these groups, each made up of four or five canvases, are linked not only by the nearly identical subject matter but also by a similar chromatic scheme and handling of paint. After traveling for much of the 1880s, Monet seemed to have been revitalized by the wealth of possibilities offered by the landscape elements in the immediate surroundings at Giverny.\n\nMonet, early in his career, used the term series in a general way to refer to groups of paintings that were in progress at the same time, such as the works he did while at Argenteuil. By the 1890s, however, he applied the word more specifically in reference to \u201ctightly integrated groups of paintings.\u201d For these series, starting around 1889\u201390, Monet consciously set out to paint a whole sequence of works depicting the same elements in different atmospheric conditions rather than merely versions of the same motif, as was the case at Argenteuil or the Gare Saint-Lazare works.\n\nMonet\u2019s group of paintings from his Creuse River valley campaign in early 1889, especially the twelve canvases showing the same massive rocks at the rivers\u2019 confluence in varying times of day and seasons of the year, can be said to constitute the artist\u2019s first series. While smaller in number, the field compositions that followed the Creuse campaign can be seen as direct precursors to the Stacks of Wheat series (1890\u201391). Of the four canvases from the poppy group, three are dated\u2014Field of Poppies (fig. 26.1) and Field of Poppies near Giverny (fig. 26.2), both dated 1890, and the Art Institute\u2019s canvas, dated 1891\u2014suggesting that the poppy field paintings, and others from the Giverny field groups, were conceived in the summer of 1890 and put aside by the end of August\u2013beginning of September when Monet became engrossed with the Stacks of Wheat series. That Monet chose at least one representative from each of these small field groups to accompany the fifteen Stacks exhibited at Durand-Ruel\u2019s gallery in May 1891 indicates that he recognized their significant role in the conceptual development of what was to be an artistic breakthrough.\n\nThe hay, oat, and poppy field compositions were not painted on Monet\u2019s immediate property but in the \u201carea known as Les Essarts, a tract of land that lay between the Epte and the Bras de Limetz, a ten minute walk south of Monet\u2019s water lily pond.\u201d The hills in the background, which rose up in Monet\u2019s backyard, and the fields in and around his property are relatively similar, distinguished by the crops or by invasive wildflowers (fig. 26.5). Only the trees, which connect sky to field and offer a break in the horizontal zones, provide information on Monet\u2019s exact vantage point. For the poppy field canvases (e.g. fig. 26.2), for example, the prominence of the poplar trees and the closer-in view of the hills suggests the area slightly west of Monet\u2019s Giverny pond, looking toward the village of Vernon.\n\nIn July 1890 Monet\u2019s future biographer, the politician and journalist Georges Clemenceau, visited the artist while he was at work on these field canvases. In \u201cR\u00e9volution de cath\u00e9drales,\u201d first published in 1895, Clemenceau\u2019s description of Monet \u201cwith his three canvases in front of his poppy field, changing his palette as the sun ran its course,\u201d is contradicted by the nearly identical palette used in the four poppy field paintings. Furthermore, when Clemenceau republished the article in 1928, he changed the details somewhat, relating how the artist worked on \u201cfour easels on the banks of the Epte river, in front of the poppy fields bordered by poplar trees.\u201d Although the notion that Monet set up four separate easels has been disputed by many, including Monet\u2019s stepson Jacques Hosched\u00e9, Clemenceau\u2019s eyewitness account and emphasis on the \u201ctruth\u201d resulting from Monet\u2019s \u201cfour canvases in full light\u201d set the stage for thinking about how these canvases, and the revolutionary \u201cseries\u201d that would follow, were painted.\n\nThe scale, composition, and surface of the Art Institute\u2019s Poppy Field are very similar to the three other poppy canvases. However, transmitted-infrared and X-ray images show that the Chicago painting was executed over a previous landscape (fig. 26.6). The outlines of what appears to be a cliff are clearly visible in X-ray, as is the active brushwork filling in this large shape, which rises nearly to the top of the canvas. It seems plausible that the composition relates to the \u00c9tretat paintings of cliffs from Monet\u2019s campaigns in 1883 and 1885 (e.g., fig. 26.7). In a letter to his companion, Alice Hosched\u00e9, written during his 1885 stay at \u00c9tretat, Monet complained that the changing conditions of the sea and the variable weather were causing him great difficulty. This tantalizing and all-too-familiar complaint certainly speaks to the level of frustration Monet experienced in his struggle to put nature onto canvas, but could it also suggest that he abandoned a canvas to be reused several years later? A palette-shaped stamp, once visible on the verso of the original canvas of the Art Institute picture, which has been lined, indicates that it was purchased from Vieille &amp; Troisgros, one of Monet\u2019s preferred suppliers (fig. 26.8). Located on the rue de Laval, Vieille &amp; Troisgros were in partnership between 1879 and 1883. Although not a weave match with the Art Institute\u2019s \u00c9tretat pictures from the 1885 campaign (see cat. 21 and cats. 22\u201323), the canvases for these paintings do exhibit a thread count match to Poppy Field (Giverny); furthermore, because the ground layer is similar to the grounds on the Art Institute\u2019s \u00c9tretat works, along with an underlying composition that is strikingly similar to others from the \u00c9tretat campaigns, it seems possible that the canvas may have been left in the studio after one of Monet\u2019s trips to \u00c9tretat and reused many years later for this series.\n\nWhatever the circumstances surrounding the reuse of the canvas, the previous composition was not thoroughly scraped off. Areas of the initial landscape, though not entirely resolved, seem to have been painted broadly and rather thickly (fig. 26.9). This brushwork is still visible to the unaided eye, especially in the sky area, where horizontal as well as contour strokes from the earlier painting can be discerned (fig. 26.10). It is clear that Monet also made a few modifications to the final composition, especially the area in the center around the tree: he brought the sky over the green of the foliage and slimmed down the tree\u2019s trunk, in particular on the left-hand side (see Technical Report). Elsewhere, such as in the foreground, where there appears to be no trace of the underlying landscape, there are a few areas where one can see the original primed canvas through the paint layer (fig. 26.11).\n\nIn the Chicago painting and the other near-identical versions, Monet used long, horizontal strokes for grass, to which he added small flicks of colored pigments to evoke poppies bending in the wind (fig. 26.12), a technique similar to his use of blue-white daubs of pigments in the Creuse paintings to suggest rippling water (see cat. 25). This recalls also his depiction of the poppies in full blossom in an earlier painting of a field (fig. 26.13 [W1000]), whose construction, with its deep foreground, high horizon line, and rectangle of poppies receding toward a curving ravine, is entirely different from the gentle, horizontally balanced and decoratively framed poppy fields of the early 1890s. Another earlier composition, Field of Corn (fig. 26.14 [W676]), painted at V\u00e9theuil and dated 1881, features the same compositional division of field, trees, and sky with windswept grasses and billowing clouds that imparts a sense of the momentary, of the on-the-spot execution. The Chicago composition could have been generated in a similar way; bits of plant or grass embedded in the surface (fig. 26.15) confirm that it was at least partially painted en plein air, and indentations and pressure points, noted along the edges of the canvas, moreover, suggest that the artist moved the canvas before it was completely dry and perhaps put it in some kind of traveling case (see Technical Report). The final surface, however, is a combination of densely applied strokes, sometimes wet-in-wet and sometimes wet-over-dry, encrusted with daubs of variegated pigments suggesting work done both outdoors and in the studio. Deceptively simple at first glance, the surface is the result of a complicated technique that in a way calls to mind Georges Seurat\u2019s experiments with divided color in the mid-1880s (e.g., fig. 26.16).\n\nMonet\u2019s attraction to fields of grasses, flowers, and poppies dates to his residence at Argenteuil (e.g., fig. 26.17 [W274]) and would reappear in 1880 and 1881 near V\u00e9theuil (e.g., fig. 26.14) and in 1885 and 1887 near Giverny (e.g., fig. 26.13). But it was the group of poppy canvases that Clemenceau singled out as launching Monet\u2019s \u201cr\u00e9volution.\u201d In many ways Clemenceau\u2019s statement is an accurate assessment of what would be Monet\u2019s next chapter. Indeed, for the next four years, the artist painted in the vicinity of Giverny, exploring the possibilities of depicting a simple motif in varying degrees of surface complexity, which would be his signature for his major series Stacks of Wheat, Poplars, and Cathedrals.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Poppy Field (Giverny) was painted on a pre-primed, no. 30 seascape (marine) standard-size linen canvas. A supplier\u2019s stamp from Vieille &amp; Troisgros was documented on the back of the original canvas. There is a single, off-white ground layer. Technical examination revealed that a different composition was initially painted on the canvas, one in which a large hill or cliff occupied most of the upper left side of the painting. Texture from the brushwork of the earlier composition remains visible on the surface of the painting. It appears that the artist applied a thin, light-hued, intermediate layer over much of the upper part of the canvas before beginning the final painting. The final composition was painted using both wet-over-dry and wet-in-wet paint applications. The sky, hill, and trees in the final composition consist of fairly thick, continuous paint layers, whereas the poppy field was built up using an open network of individual strokes with small passages of exposed ground visible in places and earlier brushstrokes contributing both texture and color to the final surface. In many areas, the paint has a very fluid appearance, suggesting that Monet modified his tube paints with added medium. The artist made some minor adjustments around the edges of some of the trees; the most significant change involved the tallest tree, which was made narrower along its left edge. Some plant matter was found embedded in the paint layer, possible evidence of the artist having worked outdoors.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 26.18).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 91 (lower right, in dull, yellowish-green paint) (fig. 26.19). Some of the underlying brushstrokes were still wet when the painting was signed (fig. 26.20).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 60 \u00d7 92 cm. This corresponds to a no. 30 seascape (marine) standard-size canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 28.6V (0.7) \u00d7 27.6H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave matches were detected with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild, relatively even cusping on the top, bottom, and right edges and more pronounced cusping on the left edge, which is also an unprimed edge (see Ground application/texture).\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1963 treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks are spaced 8\u201310 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes are spaced approximately 5\u20138 cm apart. The original tack holes correspond to the cusping pattern on all sides.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher dates to 1963 treatment (see Conservation History). Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1963-treatment stretcher was probably the original stretcher. The 1963 examination report describes it as a five-piece stretcher with a vertical crossbar, mitred joints, and keys (see Conservation History). Depth: Not documented. Based on intermittent creases along the tacking edges, where it appears that excess fabric may have been folded over the back edge of the original stretcher, the depth appears to have been 1.5\u20132 cm.\n\nA stamp on the back of the original canvas was transcribed before the painting was lined in 1963 (see Conservation History) (text within palette-shaped frame): [. . .] 35 R[UE] [. . .] / PARIS / COULEURS FINES / TOILES PANNEAUX (fig. 26.21).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of the top, bottom, and right tacking margins but stops short of the left edge where the unprimed canvas is visible (fig. 26.22). This indicates that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric on three sides; the left edge probably corresponds to the edge of the larger roll of canvas that was attached to the commercial priming frame. The ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 15 to 100 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 26.23). Several tiny bubble holes were observed in the ground layer.\n\nThe ground is off-white with fine black particles and possibly a few red particles visible microscopically (fig. 26.24, fig. 26.25).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of iron oxide, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nOverall, the painting was heavily worked up, as evidenced by the relative density of the paint layers in the X-ray, which also shows extensive brushwork in the central and upper left areas that is unrelated to the final composition (fig. 26.26). The nature of this brushwork is clarified somewhat by the transmitted-infrared image, which clearly shows a much higher horizon line, possibly related to a hill or a cliff, in the upper left half of the painting in the earlier composition (fig. 26.27). The horizon line extends up to 15 cm from the top edge of the canvas at its highest point. The texture of the brushstrokes used to delineate the upper edge of this landform remains visible on the surface of the painting (fig. 26.28). Near the central area of the canvas, there are some arch-shaped and vertical forms that could be related to contours in this form (fig. 26.29). In some places, the brushwork of the underlying composition was quite thickly applied, which may indicate that the earlier painting was developed beyond simply an initial lay-in of the composition (fig. 26.30); however, no features from the earlier composition were visible on the right side or in the foreground of the canvas. The paint in the sky is fairly continuous and obscures any view of underlying paint colors or brushstrokes related to the first painting. In a few places, a warm off-white-colored layer is visible in the area of the painted-out forms in the upper left, but this seems to be a broadly applied layer, perhaps used to cover the earlier forms or to provide a general tone before beginning the final composition. Only in a few small places, through gaps in the upper brushwork, some darker tones are visible, which may be related to the first composition; for example, the dark-brownish-gray paint underneath the foliage and sky on the right side of the third tree from the left (fig. 26.31).\n\nAs mentioned above, the final composition appears to have been painted on top of a broadly applied intermediate layer. The mainly horizontal brushstrokes of this layer can be seen in the X-ray, in the area of the painted-out forms and underneath the trees of the final painting (fig. 26.32). The texture of these brushstrokes is visible on the surface of the painting and, in a few places, where it was not completely covered by subsequent paint applications, the layer appears to be light in tone: a warm, off-white color (fig. 26.33). In the poppy field composition, the brushwork in the sky is rather vigorous compared with the calm appearance of the sky in the final painting. This is due mainly to highly brushmarked underlayers, including some quickly applied, textural zigzag strokes, which may be related to the earlier composition since they seem to be concentrated outside the area occupied by the landform in the earlier composition. These brushmarks were dry when the blue of the sky was built up over top (fig. 26.34). The warm, pinkish-gray paint of the clouds was applied last, when the underlying blue paint was already dry. The clouds on the left side consist of fairly thickly applied strokes that mostly conceal the blue paint of the sky (fig. 26.35); on the right side, the paint of the clouds is thinly applied and appears to have been wiped or otherwise partially removed, revealing the peaks of the ridges of the blue strokes underneath (fig. 26.36). In the poppy field, an underlayer consisting of thinly applied, mainly horizontal strokes of pale-green paint covers a large portion of the foreground and appears to have been applied directly over the ground layer (fig. 26.37, fig. 26.38). Ground remains visible in places due to the open brushwork, especially in the lower left corner (fig. 26.39). Texture throughout the poppy field was built up using relatively long, diagonal and zigzag strokes of thick paint (often mixtures of lead white and vermilion), which appear radio-opaque (fig. 26.40). At the same time, a relatively solid horizontal band of brushstrokes was applied along the far edge of the field (fig. 26.41, fig. 26.42). The thick brushstrokes and narrow tonal range used in this area blur together when viewed from a distance, providing a sense of recession into space (fig. 26.43). The rest of the surface of the field was then broken up with more discrete touches of green, red, yellow, and blue, which become increasingly intense toward the foreground.\n\nIn general, the upper paint layers were worked up wet-in-wet, using paint that had a rather fluid consistency. The individual strokes do not hold the peaks of the brush ridges, resulting in relatively smooth surfaces, which suggest that the artist added medium or thinner to his tube paints to adjust the consistency (fig. 26.44). In some places, the fluidity of the paint has caused colors to swirl together on the canvas (fig. 26.45). Much of the crisp, brush-marked texture visible on the surface of the painting, which is accentuated when the work is viewed in raking light, was built up from the underlying layers that were allowed to dry before subsequent layers of more fluid paint were applied on top. Where the more fluid paint is thickly applied, it can obscure the underlying texture; where it is thinly applied, it often conforms to the ridges of the strokes underneath, creating a varied surface (fig. 26.46). In spite of the relatively thick buildup of paint overall, the texture of the canvas weave remains evident in some places where the paint is more thinly applied, throughout the sky and the field (fig. 26.47). The trees and hill, on the other hand, are more thickly built up, which largely obscures the canvas texture (fig. 26.48).\n\nA few changes were made around the edges of some of the trees late in the painting process. In these areas, the artist reduced the foliage by extending blue paint from the sky over the blue and green strokes of the leaves, which still remain faintly visible on the surface (fig. 26.49). This is most evident along the left edge of the tallest tree (fig. 26.50). The infrared reflectogram shows that this tree was originally significantly wider, especially near the top (fig. 26.51).\n\nSome plant matter was observed embedded in the paint layer, along the lower edge of the painting (fig. 26.52, fig. 26.53). In some places, only the impression of the material in the once soft paint remains, either having fallen from the surface or been plucked out by the artist. These accretions occurred during the painting process, since subsequent brushstrokes were observed to pass over both the material (fig. 26.54) and the impressions (fig. 26.55). Several gouges and areas of topped impasto, which occurred when the paint was still soft, were observed under magnification throughout the field. Along the bottom edge, areas of flattened paint were also seen (fig. 26.56). These are probably accidents from handling and/or transporting the painting before it was completely dry.\n\nBrushes including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers (fig. 26.57).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence suggests that the artist used red lake throughout the poppy field.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished. In 1997, the synthetic varnish applied in 1963 was removed. The 1963 examination report states that the painting was unvarnished at that time. (see Conservation History). The painting has a soft, relatively matte appearance with subtle variations in gloss depending on the qualities of the paint.\n\nIn 1963, the canvas was wax-resin lined and mounted on an ICA spring stretcher. The treatment report states that \u201cthe new stretcher was made a bit larger than the painting so that all parts of the painting would be exposed.\u201d Surface grime was removed. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Retouching was carried out along the right edge where a significant border of unpainted ground was exposed after restretching. A final spray coat of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied.\n\nIn 1997, the synthetic varnish applied in 1963 was removed.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. The tacking edges are deteriorated from wear and handling with moderate associated loss of ground on the edges and foldovers. There are a few tiny paint losses, mainly along the bottom edge. Small areas of flattened and abraded paint appear to be due to handling when the paint was still soft. There is some flattened paint and wood fibers around the edges, probably caused by framing while the paint was still soft. Cracking is minimal and, where present, is very fine. There are very light stretcher-bar cracks in the area of the original vertical crossbar, as well as some microscopic drying cracks specific to the paint of the signature and date (fig. 26.58). Some retouching residues are visible around the edges. There are a few tiny accretions in the sky and some gold from the frame around the edges. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, eighteenth-century, Salvator Rosa, scotia frame with carved and applied ribbon and reel at the top of the scotia and carved ogee acanthus-leaf-and-shield sight molding. The frame is water gilded over a thin, yellowish-raw sienna colored bole. Only the top convex molding is burnished; the other gilded surfaces are matte. The sides and back fillet edge are not gilded and are painted in raw sienna. The frame retains the original glue size. The mitered face and sight moldings are poplar and are applied to a half-lapped cassetta of poplar and sweet chestnut. The ribbon-and-reel ornament was carved and gilded independently and pinned to the fillet top of the scotia. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is scotia side; convex molding with treacle back; fillet with applied three-quarter-round ribbon-and-reel molding; scotia; and ogee with acanthus-leaf-and-shield motif (fig. 26.59).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975): The work was previously housed in a mid-twentieth- century, American, silver-gilt, cushion-shaped molding frame with a ribbon and reel on the outer edge and an independent liner (fig. 26.60). By 1995, the frame was reduced in size and the linen liner removed.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Hamman, Paris, as agent for Knoedler and Company, New York, Sept. 1891.\n\nAcquired by Potter Palmer, Chicago, by Jan. 24, 1893.\n\nOn deposit from Potter Palmer, Chicago, to Durand-Ruel, New York, by Jan. 24, 1893.\n\nSold by Potter Palmer, Chicago, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Jan. 24, 1893, for 5,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to William W.

This range includes the inscribed date of 1891 and allows for the possibility that Monet began the painting in 1890, when he was working on similar versions of this same composition\u2014see, for example, Poppy Field (1890; Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Mass. [W1251]). Daniel Wildenstein suggests that the Art Institute\u2019s work was painted in 1890.

Previously, Poppy Field (Giverny) has been dated 1890, see Richard R. Brettell, \u201cThe Fields of France,\u201d in A Day in the Country: Impressionism and the French Landscape, ed. Andrea P. A. Belloli, exh. cat. (Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 1984), pp. 256; 260; 261, no. 103 (ill.).\n\nOn Monet\u2019s hiatus, see Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat.

See Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 273, n. 12; and Richard R.

Christian von Holst, \u201cTravel Impressions,\u201d in Christian von Holst and Christofer Conrad, with contributions by Roman Zieglg\u00e4nsberger and Katja Matauschek, Claude Monet: Fields in Spring, exh. cat. (Staatsgalerie Stuttgart/Hatje Cantz, 2006), pp. 38\u201343, includes an additional work, Poppy Field (1890; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W1255]), which shows the same subject of poppies, framed slightly differently and with a different array of trees in the background. Of the four the Art Institute\u2019s version is closest in size to the Hermitage canvas, while the three other poppy field compositions are all slightly longer. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nAmong the field groups, Prairie \u00e0 Giverny is compositionally similar to three other canvases, Effect of Spring at Giverny (1890; sold Sotheby\u2019s, New York, May 5, 2010, lot. 34 [W1245]), Meadow with Cloudy Skies (1890; private collection [W1246]) and Flowered Meadow at Giverny (1891; private collection [W1248]). Champ d\u2019avoine (Oat Field) is compositionally similar to four other canvases, Oat and Poppy Field (1890; private collection [W1256]), Oat and Poppy Field (1890; private collection [W1257]), Oat and Poppy Field (1890; Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg [W1258]), and Oat Field (1890; sold Christie\u2019s, London, Dec. 8, 1998, lot. 12 [W1260]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nPaul Tucker suggests that Monet\u2019s growing focus on rural subjects at this time was in part influenced by his age; Monet was growing older and \u201cprobably felt the urge to stay closer to home.\u201d Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 69.\n\nSee, for example, Monet to Georges de Bellio, June 20, 1876, in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1, Peintures, 1840\u20131881 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), p. 430, letter 90. For an overview of how Monet, as well as his critics, used the term series to describe his work over the course of his career, see John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 193.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 193. According to House, even though Monet came to use the term series to describe a specific kind of work later in his career, \u201chis quite casual previous uses of it, and its common usage by critics and other artist, show that his use of the term in itself has no great significance in the genesis of his serial procedure.\u201d\n\nSee Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 41.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 197\u201398.\n\nSee Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), pp. 74\u201375. The delay in finishing some of these canvases may have been exacerbated by poor weather in September and by Monet\u2019s purchase on November 17, 1890\u2014with the help of an advance from his dealer Durand-Ruel\u2014of the Giverny home and property, which he had rented since 1883. He paid 22,000 francs, in installments. See Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), pp. 219\u201320. According to Daniel Wildenstein, Poppies (1890/91; private collection [W1254]) is unsigned and undated. In the group of canvases depicting hay in the meadows around Giverny, Prairie \u00e0 Giverny, Effect of Spring at Giverny (1890; sold Sotheby\u2019s, New York, May 5, 2010, lot. 34 [W1245]) and Meadow with Cloudy Skies (1890; private collection [W1246]) are dated 1890, and Flowered Meadow at Giverny (private collection [W1248]) is dated 1891. See Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 478. Flowered Meadow at Giverny, like the Art Institute\u2019s Poppy Field, was likely started in the summer of 1890 and set aside to be completed later. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe works shown alongside the Stacks of Wheat canvases in the May 1891 exhibition included Field of Poppies, Prairie \u00e0 Giverny, Meadow with Cloudy Skies (1890; private collection [W1246]), and Champ d\u2019avoine (Oat Field). On the canvases that make up the Stacks of Wheat series, see Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 77; and John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 199\u2013201.

(Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 273, n. 11. Essarts is a generic term that refers to a cleared field, usually one used for agricultural purposes; several towns and sites in France bear this name. Monet\u2019s stacks of wheat were painted at Clos Morin, the field lying immediately west of Monet\u2019s house. See John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 197.\n\nPoppies could be considered more of a scourge than a blessing for farmers; in grain fields they reduced the yield of the harvest and the purity of the crop. Richard Brettell suggests that \u201cMonet saw the agricultural landscape . . . with the eyes of an urbanite for whom even agricultural nature was a garden.\u201d See Richard R. Brettell, \u201cThe Fields of France,\u201d in A Day in the Country: Impressionism and the French Landscape, ed. Andrea P. A. Belloli, exh. cat.

Vernon is still the train station for Giverny, located about two kilometers from Monet\u2019s home.\n\nGeorges Clemenceau, \u201cR\u00e9volution des cathedrals,\u201d La justice, May 20, 1895, p. 1, translated in Charles F. Stuckey, ed., Monet: A Retrospective (Hugh Lauter Levin, 1985), p. 176. Paul Tucker notes that Clemenceau\u2019s description of Monet\u2019s working method is somewhat of an exaggeration, since the palettes in at least three of the poppy field canvases are not particularly different; see Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 273, n. 12.\n\n\u201cLes quatre chevalets des bords de l\u2019Epte, devant les coquelicots bord\u00e9s de peupliers, avaient marqu\u00e9 l\u2019entr\u00e9e en ligne de la lumi\u00e8re surprise en course selon l\u2019heure du jour.\u201d Georges Clemenceau, \u201cR\u00e9volution de cath\u00e9drales,\u201d L\u2019art vivant, Nov. 1, 1928, p. 826.\n\nPaul Tucker mentions that there is no evidence to support the claim that Monet used more than one easel at this time. See Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201990s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat. (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), p. 273, n. 12. For Jacques Hosched\u00e9, see John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p 198. House mentions that Monet was known later to have more than one easel set up at one time when working around his lily pond.\n\n\u201cQuelle r\u00e9volution individuelle nous est soudain demand\u00e9e, quand Monet, avec ses quatre toiles en pleine lumi\u00e8re, pour suivre la marche du soleil, nous apporte le pire des scandales, celui de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9!\u201d See Georges Clemenceau, \u201cR\u00e9volution de cath\u00e9drales,\u201d L\u2019art vivant, Nov. 1, 1928, p. 826.\n\nAccording to John House, Monet likely reused canvases for budgetary reasons when he was strapped for money, mostly prior to 1880 (see, e.g., Exterior View of Saint-Lazare Station, 1877; private collection [W447]), and that the \u201cfew traced examples of reused canvases after 1880 were all executed on Monet\u2019s travels, when he would have been more reluctant to scrap abortive starts for fear of being unable to obtain fresh materials,\u201d even though he may have been able to afford to discard canvases. See John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 183. The Art Institute painting, however, is an example of a post-1880 canvas that was not reused during an away-from-home campaign, but was rather reused several years later while the artist was working near his home.

Later accounts of Monet\u2019s working habits include various assistants who carried canvases or fetched supplies. Maurice Guillemot recalled a \u201clocal man, a gardener\u2019s helper, who accompanies him [Monet], unties the packages\u2014as they call the stretched canvases joined in pairs and numbered\u2014and the artist sets to work.\u201d See Maurice Guillemot, \u201cClaude Monet,\u201d La revue illustr\u00e9e, Mar. 15, 1898, n. pag., translated in in Charles F. Stuckey, ed., Monet: A Retrospective (Hough Lauter Levin, 1985), p. 195. His stepdaughter Blanche Hosched\u00e9 was also mentioned. When working on his Stacks of Wheat series, Monet used a wheelbarrow \u201cpushed by a willing helper, generally Blanche Hosched\u00e9,\u201d piled up with \u201cas many canvases as there were impressions to record.\u201d See Daniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 274. According to one account, Monet was caught out in one of his fields without enough canvases, and he had Blanche run back to the house several times for more.

That poppy field, bordered by its three elms, marked an era in perception as well as in the expression of things.\u201d See Georges Clemenceau, \u201cR\u00e9volution des cathedrals,\u201d La justice, May 20, 1895, p. 1; translated in Charles F.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natrual light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF and PLM analysis indicate that the paint mixture includes cadmium yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and lead white. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Poppy\\_22\\_4465\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2010; and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_4465\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Dec. 4, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_4465\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 16, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Poppy Field (Giverny) (W1253/1922.4465),\u201d Oct. 2011\n\nThe canvas does, however, present a thread-count match with \u00c9tretat: The Beach and the Falaise d\u2019Amont (1885; 1964.204 [W1012]) (cat. 21), The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat (1885; 1922.428 [W1025]) (cat. 23), and Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (1886; 1964.210 [W1095]) (cat. 24), three paintings that have a warp-thread match (see Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet W1012, W1025, W1095,\u201d Apr. 2011). This is important to keep in mind, given that these three works have a Vieille &amp; Troisgros canvas stamp dating from the period 1879\u201383, and that Poppy Field has the same canvas stamp (see Manufacturers/Suppliers Marks) and appears to have an earlier, unrelated painting underneath the final composition (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions). For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). For dating of Vieille &amp; Troisgros canvas stamp, see St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 53\u201354, 63. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nTwo marks, possibly executed in pencil, were observed on the right and bottom tacking edges; it is not known when or why they were applied.\n\nThe 1963 treatment report states that \u201cthe new stretcher was made a bit larger than the painting so that all parts of the painting would be exposed.\u201d See Alfred Jakstas, treatment report, Aug. 22, 1963, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. This perhaps provides the rationale for the treatment of other Monet paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago in this era, which were restretched after lining onto ICA spring stretchers that were slightly larger than the original stretcher dimensions.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Aug. 12, 1963, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe back of the original canvas is now obscured by the lining canvas. Only a trace of the stamp was discernible in the transmitted-infrared image.\n\nThe stamp is undoubtedly that of the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros, located at 35 rue de Laval. Vieille &amp; Troisgros was in operation from 1879 to 1883, according to St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 53\u201354, 63. The presence of this stamp on a work painted in 1890\u201391 suggests that the stretched canvas was sitting around for a significant period of time, either in the supplier\u2019s shop or in Monet\u2019s studio. The presence of another composition underneath the final painting may indicate that Monet had purchased and started painting on the canvas at an earlier date (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions).\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nMicrofossils were identified by PLM and SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_4465\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 16, 2013.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. Fine black particles were observed microscopically in the cross sections. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_4465\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 16, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Poppy\\_22\\_4465\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSome of the forms seem very specific, particularly the two thin verticals with slanted tops just to the right of the tallest tree from the final composition.\n\nThis hypothesis has not been tested scientifically.The paint passages in question often exhibit tiny bubble holes at the surface. This can be caused by a number of different factors. The mixing required to incorporate solvent or medium into the paint or even the vigorous working of the fluid paint on the canvas are two possible explanations.\n\nSimilar plant matter was found in Monet\u2019s Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (1890/91; 1922.431 [W1278]) (cat. 29) and The Customs House at Varengeville (1897; 1933.1149 [W1455]) (cat. 35), also usually near the edge of the painting. This observation suggests that the material may have become adhered to the wet paint when the painting was momentarily rested on the ground. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis,vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, cobalt blue, emerald green, and viridian (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.
