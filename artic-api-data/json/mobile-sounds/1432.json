    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Greek name for this tall vessel with serpentine handles, loutrophoros, comes from the words meaning washing water and to carry. Loutrophoroi held water for ritual cleansing on one of two occasions: the marriage of a young woman or the burial of unmarried youth of either sex. The red figure paintings on the front show a bride and several attendants preparing for the wedding ceremony. The attendants hold ritual bridal paraphernalia including mirrors, a fan, jewelry, garlands, oil and small boxes called cistas that held ritual implements. The scene on the back, which may be difficult to see, depicts women visiting a young woman\u2019s tomb reemphasizing the dual associations of a loutrophoros. Athens dominated the manufacture of red figure vases in the late sixth and fifth centuries B.C.; then the center of ceramic production in the Mediterranean shifted to southern Italy. This loutrophoros from around 365 B.C. originated in Apulia a Greek settlement in the so-called \u201cheel\u201d of Italy.</p>\n",
