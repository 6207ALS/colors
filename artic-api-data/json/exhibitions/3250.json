    "short_description": "In the final decades of the Victorian era, architectural critics lamented contemporary trends in domestic construction\u2014\u201criots of ugliness\u201d\u2014which they believed were responsible for a general disintegration of architectural tradition in the United States. These complaints focused on architects and builders who used a variety of stylistic borrowings from pattern books and popular magazines to appeal to a new market for \u201cindividualized\u201d houses incorporating neoclassical columns, pointed gothic arches, and a veritable cacophony of brick, stone, and painted wood finishes.",
