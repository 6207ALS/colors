    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Intended to store photographs or postcards, this small chest was designed around 1902 by Austrian architect, Josef Hoffmann.  Its drawers are inlaid with sinuous plant like forms in metal, these were inspired by the Art Nouveau or New Art movement which was then extremely fashionable in Paris and other European centers of design.  Meanwhile the clean lines of the chest's overall form look to the British arts and crafts movement which emphasized simplicity of design and expert handcrafting.  But Hoffmann's use of exotic materials seems purely Viennese.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: In contrast to the more common woods that would have been used on English arts and crafts furniture, here you have this very Viennese sensibility in the use of palisander and maple as veneers on the surfaces of the cabinet.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Hofmann belonged to the Secessionist artist group in Vienna.  These artists aimed to create truly modern art, architecture and interior furnishings and organized exhibitions of their work.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: This cabinet was first shown in an exhibition in 1902 but it also appears as part of the interior decoration of a dining room that Hoffmann designed for a contemporary department store.&quot;</p>\n",
