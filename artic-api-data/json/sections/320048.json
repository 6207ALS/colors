During this period, he initiated a series of images drawn in the garden behind his house at 110, rue du Bac. He was unhappy with two of the resulting lithographs, The Garden Porch and The Man with the Sickle (cat. 89), and ordered the Ways to cancel the stones. Knowing Whistler\u2019s poor opinion of the two, T. R. Way omitted them from the catalogue he published during the artist\u2019s lifetime (1896); however, both were added to the revised edition (1905).\n\nIn her inventory of the lithographs in Whistler\u2019s estate, Rosalind Birnie Philip listed this image as Rue de [sic] Bac. (Trix &amp; Ethel) in Doorway, thereby identifying the two central figures as her sisters. The third woman, pictured off to the left of the archway, may be either the young Rosalind herself or a servant. The view shows more of the back of the house than of the garden, providing the impression of a large house with high, shuttered windows and a shady, latticework portico.\n\nOn July 23, after he had received the first unsatisfactory proofs of The Garden Porch, Whistler wrote to the printers asking them not to print more until he sent some corrections (letter 97). However, apparently before mailing any suggestions for alterations, he included The Porch in a list of recent lithographs that he wanted printed in sets of twenty-five each (letter 99). Probably in response to the second of the two letters from the artist, the Ways proceeded to print some impressions of The Garden Porch, although perhaps not the full order of twenty-five. Receiving a shipment of proofs on August 14, Whistler was surprised to see The Garden Porch among them. He wrote to T. R. Way: \u201cI thought I mentioned in one of my letters to you lately that . . . I didn\u2019t care for \u2018The Porch,\u2019 and didn\u2019t want any more proofs from it at present. I suppose however that I must have forgotten to tell you\u2014for you have printed the little batch and I regret the beautiful paper\u201d (letter 104). He concluded by telling the Ways to \u201cdestroy\u201d the drawing at once and to send him a \u201cdestroyed proof\u201d on \u201cthe commonest paper\u201d (now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow). Despite his negative opinion of this image, Whistler signed and sold a number of impressions that were printed prior to the cancelation of the stone.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid proofing paper (281 \u00d7 201 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (330 \u00d7 240 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory laid paper (285 \u00d7 229 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3) cream laid Japanese vellum (341 \u00d7 239 mm); cream laid Japanese vellum (336 \u00d7 238 mm); impression from canceled stone on grayish ivory wove proofing paper (289 \u00d7 223 mm).
