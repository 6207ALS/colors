    "description": "<p>Italian Renaissance art is known for its rich materials and fine workmanship that often inspire the question: How did they do that?</p><p>Whether locally-sourced or imported across oceans, the stuff of Italian Renaissance art\u2014and the way artists put it together in the workshop\u2014has a fascinating story to tell. Facilitated by Chlo\u00e9 Pelletier, Mellon COSI Research Fellow in the department of European Painting and Sculpture, this talk will explore these stories through a deep dive into the materials and techniques of three diverse Italian Renaissance objects:&nbsp;a gold-ground painting, a ceramic altarpiece, and a parchment choir book.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the image on this page is for reference purposes only and may not be featured during the gallery talk.</p>",
