    "description": "<p>Traditional triptychs from the Medieval and Renaissance periods were horizontal, with a large central image and two smaller flanking panels. Here Frankenthaler literally turned the practice on its head and conceived <em>Lot\u2019s Wife</em> vertically.<br>The artist proudly (if slightly erroneously) recalled:  \u201cI did <em>Lot\u2019s Wife</em> in one shot. I went back to do something to it and then I thought, no, don\u2019t turn back, don\u2019t look at it, leave it, it\u2019s good. That\u2019s why I called it <em>Lot\u2019s Wife</em>, because she turned and became a pillar of salt.\u201d The narrative that Frankenthaler created the print \u201cin one shot\u201d is undercut by the numerous working proofs that attest to the changes in the final composition.</p>\n",
