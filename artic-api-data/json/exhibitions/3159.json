    "short_description": "Japan has a long history of praising the talents of great female poets. This exhibition highlights depictions of female poets in Japanese prints, focusing on the two most renowned, Murasaki Shikibu and Ono no Komachi. These intelligent, beautiful court women caught the imagination of those living hundreds of years later and incited the creation of copious legends that became the subjects of No and Kabuki plays, as well as woodblock prints.",
