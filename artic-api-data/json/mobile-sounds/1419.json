    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The central flag on the side of this punch bowl is American. To the left is a British flag and to the right a Dutch flag. If you look closely you\u2019ll notice that there are only thirteen stars in the upper left corner of the American flag. At the time this bowl was made in China around 1800 America had fewer than 20 states in the Union. The wharf and factory buildings depicted on the side of this bowl are in Canton, China along the Pearl River Delta. In 1784 the newly independent nation of America joined the long established China trade in teas, spices, silks and porcelain. Here\u2019s Sarah Kelly.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY: Since they weren\u2019t allowed into the country itself, all of the traders would come in and dock their ships outside of these factories. And then Chinese traders would come to them and the exchange would happen.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The punch bowl was possibly manufactured for the American market and may have been shipped to Boston although there\u2019s no way to know this for sure. Boston was a relatively young city at this time and one that grew and prospered thanks, in part, to trading relations with the East.</p>\n",
