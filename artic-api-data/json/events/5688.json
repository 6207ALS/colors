In 1956, after seeing photographs taken in the dim light of a club during a music event organized by AJASS (African Jazz-Art Society and Studios), a group that he co-founded, Brathwaite was inspired to pick up a camera himself. Initially, he took pictures in support of a larger cause\u2014uplifting the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, which he helped to shape by organizing fashion shows and concerts in New York that celebrated African beauty, culture, and heritage and subverted Western beauty standards. These beginnings set the stage for a prolific, seven-decade career documenting the visual culture unfolding alongside the Civil Rights and Black Power movements.</p><p><em>Generously supported by the Carol Given Winston Fund. </em></p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
