    "description": "<p>Giambattista Tiepolo was one of the most significant Venetian painters, draftsmen, and printmakers of the 18th century. Founder and head of a successful family workshop, Tiepolo\u2019s activity ranged from grand-scale wall frescoes, to religious and secular paintings on canvas, to works in the more intimate mediums of etching and drawing. Working with his sons, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36973/giovanni-domenico-tiepolo\" target=\"_blank\">Giovanni Domenico</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/59059/lorenzo-tiepolo\" target=\"_blank\">Lorenzo</a>, Tiepolo carried out prestigious commissions in Italy and abroad, famously including the residence of the Prince-Bishop of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany and the Spanish royal palace in Madrid.&nbsp;</p><p>Tiepolo achieved renown at a young age working for the Catholic Church and the nobility. The <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=rinaldo&amp;classification_ids=painting&amp;artist_ids=Giambattista+Tiepolo\" target=\"_blank\">four large canvases</a> at the Art Institute are enchanting examples of the lavish, brightly colored paintings he executed for the palaces of the Venetian aristocracy. Depicting scenes from Torquato Tasso\u2019s 16th-century epic romance <em>Gerusalemme Liberata</em>, the canvases once decorated the walls of a Venetian palazzo. The Art Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16434/virgin-and-child-with-saints-dominic-and-hyacinth\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Virgin and Child with Saints Dominic and Hyacinth</em></a> is among Tiepolo\u2019s many religious paintings commissioned for churches.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most talented draftsmen of his time, Tiepolo produced a large number of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Giambattista%20Tiepolo&amp;classification_ids=drawings%20%28visual%20works%29\" target=\"_blank\">drawings</a> in different media. Whether in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111378/the-meeting-of-abraham-and-melchizedek\" target=\"_blank\">highly finished compositions</a> or <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/29416/rest-on-the-flight-into-egypt\" target=\"_blank\">rapid sketches</a>, his pen and ink wash drawings are remarkable for their seamless blend of linear energy and painterly softness. He also practiced his hand by drawing <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113293/caricature-of-a-man-full-length-facing-left\" target=\"_blank\">caricatures</a>, mostly for his private amusement. Tiepolo often used <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/244913/the-head-of-a-young-man-in-profile-to-the-left-recto-studies-of-allegorical-figures-verso\" target=\"_blank\">red chalk</a> on blue paper to sketch from life or make preparatory studies for his paintings.&nbsp;</p><p>In the 1730s and 1740s, Tiepolo worked on two series of etchings in which he envisioned a fantasy world inhabited by satyrs, soldiers, shepherds, and venerable old men in fanciful dress. First published in 1743 the ten <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14257/death-giving-audience-from-capricci\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Capricci</em></a> depict picturesque, sometimes supernatural or even macabre scenes, while the 24 <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111156/the-discovery-of-the-tomb-of-punchinello-from-scherzi\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Scherzi</em></a> are generally more enigmatic, melancholy compositions. Both series were very influential, inspiring, among others, the great printmakers <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36210/giovanni-battista-piranesi\" target=\"_blank\">Giovanni Battista Piranesi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40615/francisco-jose-de-goya-y-lucientes\" target=\"_blank\">Francisco Goya</a>.</p>",
