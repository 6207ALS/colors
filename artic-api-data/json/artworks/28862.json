    "description": "<p>Driven by the loneliness and poverty he had experienced living in the Hague, Vincent van Gogh returned to his parents\u2019 home in Nuenen, the Netherlands, in late 1883 and devoted himself entirely to painting. In Nuenen, the artist also returned to the more monochromatic palette of browns, greens, and grays that he had used in his early years in the Netherlands. He painted a series of cottages\u2014 including this painting\u2014based on his walks through the village. He described this series to his brother: \u201cI feel for the brood and the nests\u2014particularly those human nests, those cottages on the heath and their inhabitants.\u201d Van Gogh carefully infused the woman, the cottage, and the setting with the same earthy tones and the loose, directional texture of the brushstrokes. In doing so, he emphasized the way she belonged to this place, and it to her.</p>\n",
