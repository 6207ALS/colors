All of the blocks were carved from indigenous wood; the majority of them are irregularly shaped. Examination of the contours of the printed edges of multiple impressions of this print indicates that the block had a very irregular shape along the top, the bottom was only slightly irregular, and the sides were likely cut and sanded smooth by the artist. In fact, given the short supply of wood that Gauguin deemed suitable for this purpose, the small block may have been a remnant from a larger piece of wood already cut into the longer and/or wider rectangular sections that characterize the shape of the majority used for the group. The impressions display all of the same surface characteristics and textural flaws found in a number of other prints from the group. In particular, At the Black Rocks (cat. 91), Buddha (cat. 101), Eve (cat. 100), The Ox Cart (cat. 94), and Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93) share identical flaws and reproduce the horizontal wood grain pattern in the block.\n\nGauguin lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, yet the pronounced textures of wood grain and knots that printed along with his carved imagery are integral to the overall appearance of the group. These irregularities set the prints apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images of his Noa Noa Suite. The works in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints are wood-block prints in the true sense of the word: cut crudely into wood that was sawn, planed, and sanded to create work surfaces. These were far too prone to splintering to be incised with the tip of a needle, so the artist relied solely on the knife, drawing on his skill as a sculptor of wood in the round. Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin used a second, thicker paper to support the diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter paper. Using this technique Gauguin also prevented the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block or tearing when he lifted it from the block.\n\nThe wood block is printed in black ink that was thickly applied. As a result, a number of fine lines read more legibly, and they appear more even in tone in passages where the ink has filled in some of the more shallow irregularities in the block. Through the center of the block there is a falloff in intensity that correlates with a probable dip in the surface of the block.\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with mitsumata (est.) fibers and minimal sizing to print the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. The diaphanous sheets are translucent, extraordinarily fragile, and easily damaged. In this impression, the tissue-thin sheet was posthumously laid down on a sheet of cream wove paper. Owing to the thinness of the sheet, the tone of any underlying support inevitably distorts its appearance. Here, the cream-toned secondary support imparts a hue to the print that darkens it.\n\n113 \u00d7 214 mm (image); 153 \u00d7 228 mm (primary support); 154 \u00d7 229 mm (secondary support)\n\nThe vignette-like image is contained within borders that reproduce only the untouched wood grain and surface irregularities of the block at the edges. To the left, the artist incised parallel lines and rounded forms 15 mm in from the edge of the block. Along the top he incised a broad white line across the top of the composition and dropped it 10 mm from the top of the block, and on the right in this impression there is 5 mm of uncut border. The borders play a functional as well as aesthetic role by providing structural stability along the four edges of the block where the soft wood would be most vulnerable to cracking and splitting under the pressure exerted upon it during the printing process. Understanding very well the nature of his materials, Gauguin used this device to preserve and protect the edges of the majority of blocks used for the suite.\n\nWhile the softness of this wood made it impossible to render the fine lines characteristic of wood engraving, here Gauguin was successful in achieving some variation of line width in the reclining figure and above her head to the left. Elsewhere the incising lacks clarity, especially in the upper right behind the seated figure, where it is likely that the soft wood splintered under the touch of the blade.\n\nBefore entering the collection of the Art Institute, the print was laid down on cream wove paper. There was an attempt to remove this backing at some point, as evidenced by the skinned and abraded surface of the verso. In the mounting process a large crease formed horizontally along the length of the print. Brush marks from the adhesive used are visible throughout. There is about an inch of delamination along the bottom.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition.  \nHarriet K.

Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . .

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nDouglas W.
