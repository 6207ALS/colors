    "description": "<p>Best known for his association with William Blake and Samuel Palmer (who was his son-in-law), John Linnell gained recognition of his own as a painter of landscapes and biblical subjects. After a move to Surrey in 1847, Linnell explored these genres while adhering strictly to the principle of direct observation of nature. A note attached to this drawing indicates that it was made on a walk from one town to another on July 25, 1868. Linell used areas of blank paper to dramatic effect, and the placement on the page of his summary sketch emphasizes the sense that the artist drew this wooded hill from a distant walking path.</p>\n",
