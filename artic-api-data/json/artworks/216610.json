    "description": "<p>In 2005 the London-based firm A Practice for Everyday Life was asked to create an identity system and campaign for Performa, a biennial New York festival of performance art. The resulting design, employing a lush field of hand-drawn arrows pointing in different directions, celebrates the movement of the performers and the dynamic structure of the event and its visitors. Strikingly contemporary, as well as reminiscent of the arrows used in midcentury dance instructions, the graphic treatment forms the core of the identity as it is adjusted from year to year.</p>\n",
