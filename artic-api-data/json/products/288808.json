    "description": "<p>With agile brushwork, quick dabs of joyful color, and a then-daring artistic style, Claude Monet captured fleeting impressions of nature in everyday settings. Monet devoted himself to perfecting the depiction of light and atmosphere in his paintings. Weather, season, and mood are as masterfully portrayed as the less ephemeral masses of blooms in Monet\u2019s garden scenes and still lifes. The 12 impressionist paintings presented in this calendar were revolutionary when they were created, and to this day Monet is considered one of the greatest painters in the history of art.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12 x 13 in, Opens to: 12 x 26 in.12 monthly grids and full-color artwork</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><strong>High-quality printing with soy-based inks on premium, environmentally sourced paper stock</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><strong>Exceptional color quality</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><strong>Grid pages are easy to write on</strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 0.875rem;\"><strong>Features US, Canadian, and United Kingdom legal holidays</strong></span></li>\n</ul>",
