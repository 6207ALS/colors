The Tyresmith, his second lithograph dealing with the theme (see cat. 27 for the first), depicts the interior of a wheelwright\u2019s workshop in Chelsea. It was one of five lithographs (cat. 34, cat. 35, cat. 36, cat. 37, and cat. 38) transferred and proved in October 1890 (app. II.3 and app. II.4). According to an annotation in T. R. Way\u2019s hand on an impression in the British Museum, London, the two smiths working at an anvil are \u201cMending the Hoop.\u201d\n\nThe Way firm transferred The Tyresmith to supplementary stones and machine printed a large edition for the 15 November 1890 issue of The Whirlwind. It was the second of three lithographs Whistler contributed to the journal (see also cat. 34, cat. 37), and it appeared opposite a sonnet by St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.\n\nChicago: AIC, grayish ivory laid paper (210 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (307 \u00d7 206 mm). Glasgow: HAG (5), cream Japanese paper (310 \u00d7 210 mm); cream laid paper (327 \u00d7 232 mm); cream laid paper (324 \u00d7 207 mm); grayish ivory chine (180 \u00d7 189 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (382 \u00d7 281 mm); cream laid paper (245 \u00d7 196 mm). London: BM, grayish ivory chine (180 \u00d7 189 mm) mounted on white plate paper (363 \u00d7 270 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Mending the Hoop. Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (321 \u00d7 193 mm); NGA, cream Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 221 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Brooklyn, TBM; and New Haven, YUAG.\n\nPublished edition. The published edition was machine printed from supplementary stones on smooth ivory wove paper, which has often discolored to cream. Periodical impressions tend to be slightly coarser, glossier, and higher in contrast than those printed by hand. Many impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (287 \u00d7 223 mm), with legend, rebound; cream wove paper (286 \u00d7 223 mm), with legend.
