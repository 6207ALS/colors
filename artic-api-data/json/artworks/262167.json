    "description": "<p>Daniel H. Burnham\u2019s sons continued to work in his successor firm for a few years after their father\u2019s death in 1912, then established their joint practice in Chicago. The collection documents many commercial and civic buildings in Chicago and northern Illinois designed by the brothers. Both men played important roles in the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago (1933\u20131934): Daniel Jr. was secretary and director of works, and Hubert served as a member of the Architectural Commission. The collection reflects their roles with extensive holdings of business and design papers generated by some of the commercial ventures at the fair, particularly the Foreign Village Corporation. The collection includes business diaries, scrapbooks, photographs (including construction views), correspondence, and several thousand architectural drawings representing projects from the brothers\u2019 various partnerships, including the Carbon and Carbide Building in Chicago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Burnham,%20Daniel%20H.,%20Jr.%20and%20Hubert%20Burnham%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Burnham,%20Daniel%20H.,%20Jr.%20and%20Hubert%20Burnham%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
