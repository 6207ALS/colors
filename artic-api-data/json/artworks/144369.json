However, a trip to Italy in 1765\u201366 left a lasting impression on him: he was especially struck by the intense quality of Italian light, which he applied to northern landscapes. Another source of inspiration for Boissieu was Dutch 17th-century art, evident in the some 700 drawings and numerous etchings that constitute his principal oeuvre.</p>\n",
