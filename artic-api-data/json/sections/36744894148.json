Ryerson Collection, 1933.1173\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">In the fall of 1881 Renoir visited Italy, and the clearer structure of Chrysanthemums reveals a classicism that emerged in his style following the trip. The bouquet is simply contained in an earthenware crock with little indication of setting. The plain design of the vessel acts as a visual pause between the colorful blossoms and the life-size floral pattern of the tablecloth. The composition exhibits an emphatic geometry: the wide oval of the bouquet fills the canvas symmetrically, is reinforced by the central position of the crock, and is echoed in the curve of the table. The painting can be understood as a transitional work between the more spontaneous Impressionism of Peonies (fig. 15.1 [Dauberville 36]), circa 1880, and floral still lifes such as Bouquet of Chrysanthemums (fig. 15.2 [Dauberville 38]), assigned to 1881.\n\nWhile Renoir\u2019s still-life work remains an under-studied aspect of his career, the sheer number of documented canvases in this genre indicates how significant a role they played in his development. The catalogue for his first retrospective exhibition, held on the boulevard de la Madeleine in April 1883, includes six still-life paintings among seventy works. The proportion of still-life paintings to work in other genres remained roughly the same in his retrospective exhibition organized by the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in 1892. Three of the still lifes in the 1883 exhibition were identified as specific varieties of flowers: Pivoines, no. 34 (likely Peonies, c. 1880 [Dauberville 36]); G\u00e9raniums, no. 55 (fig. 15.3 [Dauberville 35]); and Lilas, no. 64 (Lilacs, 1878 [Dauberville 32]). Durand-Ruel bought Chrysanthemums from Renoir in December 1882.\n\nChrysanthemums makes no reference to setting and may represent one of the bouquets that the artist loved to keep in his home to paint when the impulse came upon him. A light source from the left casts a blue shadow on the wall to the right. This shadow closely follows the curved line of the table suggesting it is located in a circular nook of the kind found in the entrance halls of middle class homes. The table itself is quite small relative to the vase and therefore could only be a side table. Its diameter matches almost exactly the breadth of the floral bouquet.\n\nThere is a balanced distribution of white and orange blossoms across the bouquet in Chrysanthemums, while the crock and the patterned tablecloth seem thoughtfully chosen for how they complement the composition. There is, however, a certain casualness about the preparation and execution of this canvas. The application of the commercial ground layer is uneven, and the palette knife used to spread it on the canvas caused lumps of already dry material to leave gouged lines in the surface (see Preparatory Layers in the technical report). A number of these are quite prominent (fig. 15.4). Renoir simply painted over them and carried on. Traces of graphite underdrawing are apparent in skips in the upper paint layers. While thin curved lines of brown underdrawing, executed directly on top of the ground, are visible in many areas; the brown lines vaguely outline the form of short, curved petals (fig. 15.5). The underdrawing is selective and Renoir\u2019s rendering of individual blossoms appears intended to rehearse their linear rhythm and assess relative proportions directly on canvas.\n\nAs Chrysanthemums attests, Renoir\u2019s interest in the flower as an artistic subject can be dated to at least the early 1880s. He may have had the opportunity to admire paintings of the flower by Claude Monet made in 1878 and 1881. A bouquet of chrysanthemum blossoms provides an extraordinarily ebullient setting for Renoir\u2019s painting of the red-haired model Jeanne Samary, A Girl with a Fan, circa 1881 (fig. 15.6 [Daulte 360; Dauberville 344]). In this case the flowers complement the taste for Japonisme suggested by the fan in Samary\u2019s hand.\n\nFirst imported to France from the Far East during the French Revolution, chrysanthemums are a late summer flower appreciated for their strong scent and exceptional range of color and shape. Referenced in Marcel Proust\u2019s \u00c0 la recherche du temps perdu (Remembrance of Things Past), in the early twentieth century they were still considered an exotic Japanese feature of French gardens. Notably, Renoir\u2019s Chrysanthemums includes two blossom varieties, each with different color and petal shape\u2014the orange starburst variety with a long, straight petal and the white blossom variety with a shorter, denser petal that gives it a spherical appearance. This mixture of blossom varieties is a feature of the celebrated Japanese woodblock print by Hokusai, Chrysanthemums and Bee (fig. 15.7) and further adds to the Japonisme of Renoir\u2019s painting. In Hokusai\u2019s print the distinctive flat leaf of the chrysanthemum provides visual contrast with the intricate blossoms. The leaf plays an analogous role in Renoir\u2019s Chrysanthemums, which takes full advantage of the color and textural potential of the celebrated flower to produce a still-life painting of sublime authority.\n\nWhile his floral still lifes remained popular with collectors, commercial concerns were not Renoir\u2019s only motivation for painting them. Sympathetic critics recognized that his floral still lifes embodied a truly progressive approach to painting. As Renoir\u2019s German biographer, Julius Meier-Graefe, wrote in 1912, Renoir\u2019s flower paintings were like fictions of color that possessed an \u201cimmaterial completeness\u201d quite independent from reality. Such an expressive freedom is amply demonstrated in the brushwork of the bouquet in Chrysanthemums, which is feathery and gestural. Another of his biographers, Georges Rivi\u00e8re, a close friend from the early 1870s, recorded the artist\u2019s explanation for why floral still lifes afforded the opportunity for risk-taking: \u201cPainting flowers is a form of mental relaxation. I do not need the concentration that I need when I am faced with a model. When I am painting flowers I can experiment boldly with tones and values without worrying about destroying the whole painting. I would not dare to do that with a figure because I would be afraid of spoiling everything. The experience I gain from these experiments can then be applied to my painting.\u201d\n\nIndeed, a bold experimental approach to floral still-life painting can be seen throughout Chrysanthemums, in the chromatic links that unify the composition and establish a tonal theme. Red, orange, and yellow predominate, with white, blue, and green acting as counterbalance. The intermingling of orange and white blossoms across the bouquet makes the unusual choice of a russet tone for the background less unsettling. Renoir draws upon the ability of the eye to mix colors near one another. Yellow is used for the blossoms, areas of dappled sunlight on the tablecloth, and to brighten the part of the vase facing the light source. Red is used for the background as well as to highlight the radiating line of petals in the yellow blossoms to give them an orange appearance (fig. 15.8). The blues of the tablecloth also appear in the deeper shadows of the bouquet as well as defining the petals of the white blossoms. Julie Manet, the daughter of Impressionist painter Berthe Morisot, who was under the guardianship of Renoir and Edgar Degas after her mother died in 1895, wrote in her diary, \u201cM. Renoir said that one should paint still lifes in order to learn to paint quickly.\u201d If speed was a concern for the artist in painting Chrysanthemums, it was also an opportunity to demonstrate his consummate skill as a colorist.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This painting is executed on a very rough, unevenly applied preparation layer on a standard-size canvas. The presence of a color merchant\u2019s stamp and standard-size number on the verso of the support may indicate that the canvas was stretched by the color merchant, but it is unclear who applied the preparation. The ground layer covers the compositional area only and appears very uneven in the X-ray and along the edges. It contains many particulates, probably clumps of dried preparation that were dragged across the surface during application with a palette knife, resulting in large gouges; these characteristics may logically point to artist application. However, the composition of the ground, containing a moderate amount of calcium-based extenders, and the presence of the stamps on the verso argue strongly for a color merchant\u2019s preparation. Immediately on top of the ground, Renoir drew some compositional elements in a few different types of media, including individual bloomed chrysanthemums in very fine graphite lines, curving petals of other flowers in dilute brown paint, and possibly the outline of the earthenware crock as a first step of the painting process. The artist did not follow the drawing exactly, but the forms and placement are consistent. In one white flower (above center), the brown underdrawing lines were left exposed on white ground and articulate individual petals. It also appears that the artist painted areas of the background before finishing the flowers, bringing in additional background colors to immediately surround the petals and adding final touches to the flowers over that background at a later stage. In other areas, the background seems to have overlapped white flowers and the artist wiped these colors away, leaving a thin shadowy film in the depressions of the canvas. Edges between major still-life elements, such as the table and pitcher/vase, were blended with the background, and paint was often applied wet-in-wet and mixed on the surface. The work is currently varnished, however it is unclear whether the artist would have varnished this painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 15.9).\n\nSigned: Renoir. (upper right, in dark blue paint) (fig. 15.10, fig. 15.11).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were 54.5 \u00d7 65.2 cm, according to pretreatment measurements. This corresponds to a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size (65 \u00d7 54 cm) canvas, turned horizontally. The size 15 stamp visible in transmitted infrared is now behind the right side of the painting (fig. 15.12).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 29.7V (0.7) \u00d7 27.3H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThere is strong cusping on all four sides corresponding to original tack placement. Along with the presence of priming only in the compositional area, the strength of this cusping suggests the canvas was stretched before it was prepared.\n\nCurrent stretching: The canvas was lined and restretched in 1972 (see Conservation History), and the dimensions were increased slightly on all sides.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed 3\u20133.5 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.7 cm\n\nOriginal stretcher: Description, construction and labels taken from the previous stretcher suggest it was original. It was a four-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher. Depth: Approximately 1.8 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso (covered by lining)  \nMethod: stamp/stencil  \nContent: [. . .] FINES [. . .] / TABLEAUX / REY [A] PERROD / [51] Rue de la Rochefoucau[ld] / PARIS (fig. 15.13)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso (covered by lining)  \nMethod: stamp/stencil  \nContent: 15 (fig. 15.14)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground is applied rather unevenly to the compositional area only; it is a single layer ranging approximately 60\u2013220 \u00b5m in thickness. The uneven coverage and lack of priming on the tacking margins would tend to suggest an artist-application, however analytical evidence suggests the ground was applied by the color merchant. The nature of the rough edges around the perimeter, abrupt changes in density seen in the X-ray, and various scrape marks on the surface suggest application with a palette knife (fig. 15.15); in some areas, the initial working in with the palette knife was followed by a brush to smooth the texture and extend the priming farther toward the edges (fig. 15.16). The ground itself is granular in nature, with large, chunky white inclusions (fig. 15.17) dragged across the surface during preparation, resulting in curvilinear gouges throughout (fig. 15.18). In some areas, the X-ray indicates that these particles remain in the paint film and appear as radio-opaque spots at the ends of individual gouges. The thickness of the ground varies throughout: in some areas, it was so heavily pressed into the canvas with the palette knife that the tops of the canvas threads are exposed (fig. 15.19).\n\nStereomicroscopic examination of the surface and cross sections confirms that the ground is white, with no additional or colored particles visible (fig. 15.20).\n\nThe ground is predominantly lead white with moderate amounts of calcium carbonate (probably chalk), and traces of alumina and complex silicates (clays). The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nMicroscopic and infrared examinations indicate that the artist drew a number of the individual chrysanthemums and other flowers. Examination of the work in transmitted light shows that he outlined the earthenware crock, but it is unclear whether this was a separate step in compositional planning or the beginning of the painting stage (fig. 15.21).\n\nSome of the individual yellow chrysanthemums with long, tapering petals are articulated with very fine graphite lines (fig. 15.22). Elsewhere the artist used graphite and thin brown paint to establish the curving edges of at least one white flower (above center) (fig. 15.23). Transmitted light indicates that Renoir also painted the outline of the crock prior to painting the full composition. However, the upper paint layers have obscured the color and texture of these lines.\n\nWhile Renoir did not follow the fine graphite lines exactly, the individual petals are quite close to the original drawing (fig. 15.24). In some areas, the brown underdrawing lines were left exposed against the white ground, and it is unclear whether they were used regularly throughout. The artist followed the initial outline of the vase/pitcher in the final composition, smoothing the transition between the object and the background as he painted.\n\nIt appears that the artist established, through various methods of underdrawing, the space for the still-life elements before painting them. The artist painted the background with stiff-bristle brushes and dilute paint (fig. 15.25), leaving a roughly ovular space for the flowers. He brought in the remaining background with finer strokes to meet the still life once these elements were painted; in these areas the background has a somewhat mottled appearance. In some areas, the ground was left exposed to serve as the white body of the flowers, and thin background paint was wiped away from the edges in some areas while it was still wet. This process left a thin film that settled into the depressions of the canvas weave and the gritty, gouged texture of the preparation, visually functioning as shadow (fig. 15.26). Over this, additional paint, colors, and white impasto were added, sometimes wet-in-wet with the background or while the background was not quite dry. In some areas, like the left side of the tablecloth, the artist added paint to the object edge when he brought the background in to create a soft, blended transition.\n\nThe paint throughout varies from very thin areas of the background and initial indications of the flowers to heavy impasto in the final stages (fig. 15.27). Individual colors were applied wet-in-wet over their surroundings, using fine brushes to create visually complicated and finely articulated flower petals (fig. 15.28).\n\nMostly fine, soft brushes for the individual flower petals and wider, stiff-bristle brushes for the background with strokes up to 1 cm wide; palette knife for ground application.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, malachite, viridian, black, iron oxide red and/or yellow, vermilion, carmine lake, second red lake, zinc yellow, cadmium yellow and Naples yellow\n\nUV examination indicates that Renoir used salmon-fluorescing red lake throughout the chrysanthemums and other flowers and in broad areas of the background (fig. 15.29). Cross-sectional analysis of a sample taken from the background indicates the artist also used a second, non fluorescing red lake. As the sample analyzed contained both red lakes, it is unclear whether carmine lake is the fluorescing or non fluorescing variety (fig. 15.30).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a synthetic varnish, applied in 1972, with residues of natural resin in areas of impasto. Treatment notes from 1972 mention removal of overpaint and a discolored natural-resin varnish (see Conservation History). It is unclear if this varnish was original.\n\nThe first documented treatment occurred in 1972. At that time, the painting was described as stretched on a four-member stretcher with a hardboard insert between the painting and the stretcher. Pretreatment conditions also included abrasion, shrinkage cracks, and minor losses with overpaint to hide these damages. The presence of the hardboard and overpaint suggest the painting had been treated in the past. During the 1972 treatment, grime, varnish, and the hardboard mounting were removed, and the work was faced with mulberry fiber paper and starch paste in preparation for lining. The old six-member stretcher was discarded when the work was wax-resin lined, and the lined painting was tacked onto a four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions (21 1/2 \u00d7 25 3/4 in.). The work was inpainted with methacrylate paints and given three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nWidespread cracking, with some associated tenting, appears to come from the ground, rather than from interlayer cleavage between the ground and the paint. There are minimal localized losses in areas where cracks intersect; most have been filled and inpainted. The lining is in good condition, keeping the work relatively planar and with no delamination. The wax-resin lining material has saturated the support, making the canvas appear very dark; however, the thickness of the ground and subsequent paint layers make this affect less apparent in the compositional area. The rough perimeter, resulting from uneven preparation, has been heavily retouched in an attempt to \u201csquare\u201d the composition and compensate for the extended dimensions resulting from the 1972 treatment. The work has a glossy synthetic varnish.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Paris), late-nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, gilt ogee frame with cast foliate ornament, center and corner cartouches, and a gilt fillet liner. The frame has water and oil gilding over bole on cast plaster and gesso. The bole color is varied throughout the frame. There is red-orange bole on the sanded frieze and fillets, and red bole on the perimeter molding, sight molding, liner, and scotia sides on the ogee face. The scotia sides and liner are burnished, and the cast foliate ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The quadrillage bed on the ogee face has been rubbed selectively to expose the underlying plaster. The gilding is toned with a casein or gouache raw umber wash and gray overwash. The frame has a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face. At some point in the frame\u2019s history, the original verso was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance, a back frame was added, and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet with stylized dovetail-pierced egg-and-flower outer molding; scotia side; ogee face with cast foliate and flower ornament on a quadrillage bed, and center and corner foliate scroll cartouches with cabochon centers on a diamond bed; sanded front frieze bordered with fillets; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent flat fillet liner with cove sight edge (fig. 15.31).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 14, 1882, for 600 francs.\n\nTransferred by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, 1897.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that resulted from the research conducted for the publication Douglas W. Druick, Renoir, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1997). The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nPossibly Oct. 15, 1904: Chrysanth\u00e8mes (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Salon d\u2019Automne, Catalogue de peinture, dessin, sculpture, gravure, architecture et arts d\u00e9coratifs, exh. cat. [H\u00e9rissey, 1904], p. 115, cat. 30.)\n\nPossibly Nov. 14, 1908: Chrysanth\u00e8mes, 1882 (Durand-Ruel, New York, Exhibition of Paintings by Pierre Auguste Renoir, exh. cat. [Durand-Ruel, New York, 1908], no. 12. According to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cIl est possible mais pas certain que votre tableau soit celui expos\u00e9 chez Durand-Ruel New York en 1908 sous le no. 12\u201d; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to Gloria Groom, Apr. 2, 2014, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.)\n\nFeb. 16, 1915: Chrysanth\u00e8mes (Joseph Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel, New York, to Georges Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel, Paris, Feb. 16, 1915; confirmed by Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to Gloria Groom, Apr. 2, 2014, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.)\n\nFeb. 17, 1915: Chrysanth\u00e8mes, 1882 (Purchase receipt on Durand-Ruel letterhead, dated Feb. 17, 1915, photocopy in curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.)\n\nThe painting was dated 1881/82 based on research conducted for the publication Douglas W. Druick, Renoir, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1997). This range includes 1882, a date that has traditionally been assigned to the painting and may have originated from the Durand-Ruel stock books, and allows for the possibility that Renoir painted Chrysanthemums in 1881, while staying with the Berards in Wargemont or in Paris before leaving for Italy. See cataloguing sheet, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Colin B. Bailey, \u201cBouquet of Chrysanthemums, 1881,\u201d in Colin B. Bailey, Joseph J. Rishel, and Mark Rosenthal, Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1989), pp. 36\u201337. Although assigned to 1881, Bouquet of Chrysanthemums was more likely painted years later, judging by the atmospheric color, controlled brushwork, and the wash-like appearance of the paint in the background and table. Dauberville refers to the Renoir catalogue raisonn\u00e9: Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vols. 1\u20135 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007\u201314).\n\nDurand-Ruel, Paris, Catalogue de l\u2019exposition des oeuvres de P.-A. Renoir, exh. cat.

See Renoir: An Intimate Record, trans. Harold L. Van Doren and Randolph T. Weaver (Knopf, 1925), p. 146.\n\nRenoir not only painted chrysanthemums, he cultivated them, along with sunflowers, in his garden at the historic Ch\u00e2teau des Brouillards on the Butte Montmartre, where he lived from October 1889 until the spring of 1897. Visited by a reporter after his Young Girls at the Piano (1892; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay [Dauberville 993]) was acquired by the Mus\u00e9e Luxembourg in 1892, Renoir related that he had been told he should exhibit with the Society of Horticulturalists, conjecturing ironically that he might win his first medal. \u201cIl est tr\u00e8s fier de son jardin, M. Renoir; il s\u2019est mis \u00e0 la culture des g\u00e9raniums, des h\u00e9liotropes et des calc\u00e9olaires avec une v\u00e9ritable passion.\u201d Anonymous, \u201cNos Artistes. Le peintre P.-A.

(R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux/Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 2010), pp. 229 and 230, respectively. As Sylvie Patin observed in \u201cDe la nature morte au paysage,\u201d on p. 223 of this publication, Monet favored chrysanthemums as a painting subject, and he actively cultivated the flower in his garden at Giverny in 1885 and 1886.\n\nDaulte and Dauberville refer to the Renoir catalogues raisonn\u00e9s: Fran\u00e7oisDaulte, Auguste Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9de l\u2019oeuvrepeint (Durand-Ruel, 1971); Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vols. 1\u20135 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007\u201314).\n\nFor an authoritative discussion of Renoir\u2019s interest in the subject of chrysanthemums, see Colin B.

Recent research has also suggested, however, that smaller-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single canvases from larger, unprimed rolls. The canvas stamps on the verso in addition to the ground composition, lead white with a good proportion of extenders, suggest the support was not artist-prepared.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, indicate that the signature is primarily cobalt blue.

The stamp is seen in transmitted light and transmitted infrared and is preserved as a tracing, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.

Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. A sample of unprimed canvas from the tacking margin contained a whitish layer with a blue fluorescence in UV, suggesting the presence of an organic material such as glue, however, as the work has been lined, this material could be attributed to the starch paste facing material used in that process (see Conservation History). See Inge Fiedler and Marc Vermeulen, \u201c1933\\_1173\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 2, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn many cases, the absence of ground on the tacking margins is taken to indicate an artist-applied ground. Anthea Callen wrote, \u201cRaw fabric on the edges of a canvas support show that the ground was applied after the canvas had been stretched. This is the norm for self-priming\u2014artists generally stretched the canvas and then prime only the surface to be painted.\u201d Additionally, an unevenly applied ground, such as this one, may reinforce the idea that the canvas was artist-prepared. Recent research, however, has suggested that smaller-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single canvases. Complaints by artists such as Camille Pissarro indicate some of these supports were not of good quality. The color merchant\u2019s proprietary and standard size stamps on the verso of this painting, in addition to the composition of the ground argue for a non-artist preparation. See Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 68.

SEM/EDX and PLM confirmed that this was calcium carbonate; interestingly, it showed a wide range of particle size including some very large grains. SEM/EDX also identified alumina and silicates. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis summary, Dec. 19, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nThese lines appear to be in graphite. Lines as fine and thin as graphite may be obscured in infrared examination in some areas due to the presence of IR-absorbing pigments in the paint layers or additional underdrawing. As such, the possibility of graphite lines elsewhere, though not visible under the current circumstances, cannot be excluded.\n\nPigments identified by the following techniques: lead white, cobalt blue, vermilion, Naples yellow (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); malachite (PLM, Raman; XRF and SEM/EDX identified a copper-based green); zinc yellow (XRF, 2012 PLM, SEM/EDX, Raman); cadmium yellow (XRF, 2012 PLM, SEM/EDX); unspecified black (2012 PLM); iron oxides (XRF, SEM/EDX); viridian (PLM; SEM/EDX [as chrome-based green]); red lakes (PLM, SEM/EDX; SERS identified carmine lake). PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.

See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nPLM analysis and cross-sectional examination indicate the presence of two red lakes of slightly different shades, with one fluorescing and the other non fluorescing under UV illumination. SEM/EDX analysis indicates that the fluorescing red lake has an aluminum substrate, while the second red lake has a tin substrate. Carmine lake was identified by SERS in a sample that contained both red lakes, in addition to starch grains, which fluoresce blue under UV illumination.
