Henri Matisse gradually shaded the contours to create volumetric forms, tracing the outline of the model\u2019s veil, the graceful curve of her wrist, and the right side of her round breast, and he carefully rendered her cool, direct stare. The drawing is only partially realized; parts of the figure are not depicted\u2014indeed, the right half of the sheet is blank.\n\nGraphite is an ideal medium for drawing with delicate precision, but it is also pliable and easily altered and, unlike charcoal, can be completely erased without leaving residual marks. This mutability allowed Matisse to work through compositional challenges before translating an image to paint or print. In Young Woman with a Veil, he also employed an eraser to lighten the face and convey the translucency of the fabric. The work belongs to a group of graphite drawings and lithographs from 1928 and 1929: Odalisque in a Moorish Chair (1928; fig. 42.1), La persane (1929; fig. 42.2), an untitled work from 1929 (fig. 42.3), and the Art Institute\u2019s drawing are studies for the lithographs Hindu in a Tulle Skirt (1929; fig. 42.4), Persian Woman (1929; see fig. 61 in the print checklist), and Young Hindu (1929; fig. 42.5), respectively. Their subject is an unnamed Persian woman who became Matisse\u2019s primary model after Henriette Darricarr\u00e8re left her position in 1927 to marry. In all seven works, Matisse presents her provocatively posed in a Moorish chair and wearing an exotic costume with the same necklace and veil. Young Woman with a Veil is most closely related to an untitled drawing reproduced in the third Chroniques du jour with text by journalist Florent Fels (fig. 42.3). Both studies pay particular attention to the odalisque\u2019s veiled face, and her torso is turned slightly to the left and her arms are relaxed, open.\n\nWhile Matisse visited Morocco in 1906 and twice in 1912 (returning to France in early 1913), it was not until after World War I that the odalisque became a subject of his paintings, drawings, and prints. Focusing on physical beauty and sensual pleasure, and executed with a new stylistic realism, these works reflect a wider postwar interest in the traditional art of the late nineteenth century as well as in classical art in general. A precedent for depicting the odalisque had been set by numerous nineteenth-century French artists, including Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, both of whom Matisse admired. The odalisque also appeared in the work of academic artists such as Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, who never traveled to North Africa but presented female nudes in the acceptable context of exotic harems and Moorish baths. With the odalisques, in both style and subject matter, Matisse stepped back from his earlier depictions of contemporary nude women in landscapes and embraced a dreamier and more romantic tone. It was during this period that Matisse made the technically assured graphite drawings such as Young Woman with a Veil.  \nDebora Wood\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this veiled woman using a relatively hard graphite pencil, which yielded fine, silvery-gray lines. He sketched the composition lightly and then repeatedly retraced the forms until arriving at their final positions. This technique, absent of emphatic contours, lends softness to the final figure. Matisse added modeling to his forms with parallel shading. He used an eraser to make adjustments, erased lines in the veil at the top of the head, adjusted the position of the sofa arm (see fig. 42.6), erased lines from the proper right shoulder that initially extended across a fold in the veil, pulled out some of the shading from under the proper right arm, erased a charm on the necklace from the position farthest to the left, and erased the eyes and redrew them in a new position (see fig. 42.7).\n\nMatisse drew on the more textured side of the Italian, cream wove paper. As a result, there is a subtle jagged or broken quality to the pencil lines (see fig. 42.7). The sheet was trimmed along the lower edge to achieve the square format as indicated by a freely drawn, horizontal line marking the lower boundary of the composition.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri Matisse 29 (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 42.8).\n\nGraphite with touches of erasing.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, light-cream wove paper. Under magnification 10\u00d7 the fibers in the sheet appear uniform.\n\nThe wove paper has a distinct linear pattern evident in transmitted and raking light that was imparted by the woven wire screen on which it was produced (see fig. 42.9). Unusual for a wove paper, this pattern is more pronounced on the recto, which is the wire side of the sheet. Transmitted-light examination reveals relatively even fiber distribution. The top edge is a deckle edge. The other three sides are roughly cut or torn. For an image of the verso, see fig. 42.10.\n\nThe sheet is watermarked at the top edge, in the right corner: P. M. FABRIANO (ITALY) (0.9 \u00d7 13.0 cm) (see fig. 42.11).\n\n38.3 \u00d7 38 cm (15 \u00d7 14 7/8 in.).\n\nIn 2015 the sheet was humidified and flattened to reduce distortions. Two pinpoint brown inclusions in the sheet in the upper left quadrant have been masked with what resembles white chalk or cellulose powder. These spots strongly absorb ultraviolet light at 254 and 365 nm, suggesting they could be iron inclusions from the paper manufacturing process. There is no record of this treatment being carried out at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe edges have yellowed slightly. There is a curved dent at the top of the right edge. There are a few, scattered pinpoint brown spots and accretions.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold to Pierre Matisse, New York, after Feb. 28, 1959\u2013Mar. 18, 1959.\n\nSold to G.
