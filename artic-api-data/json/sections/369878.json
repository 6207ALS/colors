Pennell] No. 1)\n\nWhistler selected this portrait of his friend Joseph Pennell to serve as the frontispiece of a forthcoming book on lithography written jointly by Pennell and his wife, Elizabeth Pennell. The publisher of the book, T. Fisher Unwin, probably contacted the artist with the portrait commission in early January 1896. Whistler drew four lithographic portraits of Joseph Pennell (cat. 141, cat. 142, cat. 143, and cat. 144) and one of Elizabeth Pennell (cat. 145) in rapid succession that month during afternoon visits to their Buckingham Street flat. A letter from Whistler to Unwin dated January 20 establishes that by this date he had already produced one lithograph that might be suitable for the frontispiece (cat. 143), but that he thought he could do better. By January 30, when the artist wrote to Unwin again, he had produced a version that he preferred. Firelight: Joseph Pennell, No. 1 is undoubtedly this second, more satisfactory image, while Firelight: Joseph Pennell, No. 2 must have been his first attempt at a seated portrait drawn by firelight. As was his habit, Whistler added the designations \u201cNo. 1\u201d and \u201cNo. 2\u201d to the titles of the two lithographs to indicate the order of his preference, rather than their chronological sequence.\n\nThe drawing was transferred to stone and proved shortly after it was made. The Ways recorded transferring fourteen \u201cnew drawings\u201d for Whistler in January 1896 (app. II.4); the five portraits of the Pennells must have been included in that group. Whistler had been paid for the portrait by February 11, when he wrote to Unwin thanking him for payment and instructing him: \u201cNow you had better let Pennell settle with Way about have [sic] the transfer prepared and set aside for the printing when required.\u201d\n\nThe date when the Ways editioned the image for Lithography and Lithographers remains somewhat speculative. Whistler\u2019s bitter break with his printers occurred only a few months after the Pennell portraits were drawn. By 1 May 1896 there was \u201ca battle royal . . . going on,\u201d and by August 1897 all the lithographic stones in the Ways\u2019 possession were turned over to Whistler\u2019s solicitors for storage elsewhere (app. IV.14). Despite this, there is evidence to suggest that the published impressions of Firelight: Joseph Pennell, No. 1 were printed after the rupture in the Whistler-Way relationship. In The Whistler Journal (1921), the Pennells discussed Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s choice of Goulding rather than Way to print the posthumous editions of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. They remarked that Birnie Philip \u201cwould not allow Way, who alone understood anything about the stones from which he had printed Whistler\u2019s work, to print them, though Whistler after he gave up Way and took the stones from him, had been willing for him to print the portrait of J. for our Lithography and Lithographers, sure that no one else could print it so well.\u201d On the basis of this statement, it is likely that the large edition was pulled by the Ways sometime after August 1897.\n\nThe stone bearing Firelight: Joseph Pennell, No. 1 was erased on Birnie Philip\u2019s orders and no posthumous edition was printed (see also cat. 142, cat. 143, and cat. 145).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (286 \u00d7 228 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (355 \u00d7 262 mm), signed.

Firelight: Joseph Pennell, No. 1 was included as the frontispiece of the 1898 and 1908 editions of Lithography and Lithographers, published by T. Fisher Unwin in London and The Century Co. in New York. Impressions for these editions were printed by the Ways from the original stone on cream laid Van Gelder Zonen paper. Sixteen additional impressions were printed on Japanese vellum for the 1898 deluxe edition. The Ways must have pulled many more impressions on the laid paper than were needed for the 1898 edition, as these were sufficient to illustrate the 1908 edition as well. Since the original stone was destroyed by Goulding in 1903, the image could not have been reprinted for the later edition.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (351 \u00d7 262 mm), bound in the 1898 edition (no. 8 of \u201cspecial edition for America\u201d).

Unwin sent the artist a check for twenty pounds in payment for the use of the lithograph. The artist, who always insisted on payment in guineas, returned the check with a note saying: \u201cVery nice\u2014but\u2014where are the shillings?\u201d Unwin then sent another check, presumably in guineas. If reported correctly by the Pennells, this suggests that Whistler received slightly more for the publication of his lithograph in Lithography and Lithographers than he generally charged for the periodical publication of one of his stones in the same period; Pennell and Pennell (1921), p. 113.\n\nPennell recalled that the five portraits (cat. 141, cat. 142, cat. 143, cat. 144, and cat. 145) \u201cwere all done within a few days of each other in our flat in Buckingham Street in London. Each was done in an hour or less. He sitting on the floor, his paper only lit mostly by flickering firelight\u201d; Pennell (1919), p. 28, lot no. 91.\n\nWhistler to Unwin, 20 January 1896, GUL F348.\n\nWhistler to Unwin, 30 January 1896, GUL F350.\n\nWhistler to Unwin, 11 February 1896, West Sussex Record Office, Cobden and Unwin papers, Cobden mss. 981, letter 181.\n\nWhistler described his feud with the Ways as a \u201cbattle royal\u201d in a letter he wrote on 1 May 1896 to Edward Kennedy; NYPL II/82.\n\nThe edition 1 sizes for the 1898 and 1908 printings are unknown, but they seem to have been small based on today\u2019s standards. The American edition numbered over two hundred.\n\nThe 1915 editions of Lithography and Lithographers, published in London by T. Fisher Unwin and in New York by The MacMillan Co., have a photolithographic reproduction of the portrait as the frontispiece. This reproduction was produced by F. Vincent Brooks; it is printed in gray ink on sheets of ivory wove paper (292 \u00d7 202 mm).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 144, only state.
