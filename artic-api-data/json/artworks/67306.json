    "description": "<p>The marking \u201cIB\u201d and the bird are both characteristic of the Master IB, who was recently identified as Giovanni Battista Palumba. Here Saint Jerome, known for his Latin translation of the Bible, sits in a rocky wilderness and removes a thorn from a lion\u2019s paw. The skull at his feet corresponds to his period of penance, in which he lived humbly in the desert and became interested in studying and writing. Palumbra\u2019s woodcut demonstrates highly sophisticated tonal qualities that were likely influenced by Albrecht D\u00fcrer, with cast shadows over each stone and heavily articulated contrasts of light within the lion\u2019s mane.</p>\n",
