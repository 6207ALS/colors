    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: This painting of the stacks of wheat was done when Monet was already in his sixties and it really represents the beginning of a whole new chapter in his career where he\u2019s not just painting landscapes, but he\u2019s really thinking about the motif, the subject and how it can be part of a total ensemble so that he\u2019s working in what they called series, which seems like a simple idea, but at the time no artist had really taken on one subject, seen at different times of day, different seasons. And he didn\u2019t work on them all at the same time. He might work on one, two or three canvasses, but the real work took place back in the studio where he could compare the effects that he was trying to get, the effects of sunset, for example, or the effects of snow or the early frost. And then he would work on them looking at them all together till he got them to a place where he felt, \u201cOkay, now they\u2019re finished,\u201d and then he showed them together. So, we have six of the fifteen that he exhibited in 1891, which is extraordinary, and as you can see in this one, which is the effect of snow, there\u2019s no white in this painting per se. The snow is rendered in this kind of blueish-pink, because that was the effect rather than the description he was searching for.</p>\n",
