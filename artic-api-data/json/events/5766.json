    "description": "<p>Join Harold and Margot Schiff Curator of Architecture and Design Alison Fisher, and designers Paul Ludick and Brian Johnson for a discussion of the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/10146/dan-friedman-stay-radical\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Dan Friedman: Stay Radical</em></a><em>. </em></p><p>Born in Ohio, Dan Friedman trained at legendary design schools in Ulm, Germany, and Basel, Switzerland with mentors Armin Hofmann and Wolfgang Weingart. When he returned to the United States in 1969, Friedman taught graphic design at Yale University and took on high-profile design commissions, including now-iconic branding and logos for Citibank.</p><p>His work evolved in the late 1970s, fueled by the unbridled environment of New York\u2019s East Village. There he immersed himself in alternative galleries and clubs and joined a community of like-minded radicals, including artists Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, and Tseng Kwong Chi. Leaving behind his early career, Friedman created genre-bending works of assemblage and furniture using found objects, vibrantly painted surfaces, and diverse cultural references that pushed his graphic sensibilities into three dimensions.</p><p>This exhibition is the first museum retrospective focused on Dan Friedman\u2019s extraordinary and underrecognized career. Featuring over 50 works drawn primarily from the Art Institute collection, the presentation showcases Friedman\u2019s unbounded and subversive creativity\u2014a sensibility that resonates with the stylistic and political directions of art and design today.</p><h2>About the Speakers</h2><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
