    "description": "<p>The Tenchi-in compound was founded in 708 by the monk Gyoki (668\u2013749), who also built the great national temple of Todaiji in 743. Tenchi-in was later incorporated into the organizational structure of Todaiji, which owns two similar painted scrolls that once formed a set with this one. Narrative paintings were often commissioned by temples to assist monks in describing their history and teachings to visitors. Here monks and pilgrims walk through the red gate toward the central hall dedicated to Kannon, bodhisattva of compassion and mercy. In front of the building, a sacred dance is being performed. The rectangular shape in the center of the painting likely once had a title or label written inside. At the lower left, two prancing deer and a peasant carrying a load add an everyday dimension to the scene.</p>\n",
