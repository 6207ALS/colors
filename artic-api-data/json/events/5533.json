Educators will ask questions and prompt a variety of voluntary interactive responses to foster a rich discussion informed by research, observation, and lived experience.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7522e92e-7fff-1509-0091-cb6897e4f8f0\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br></span>Who leads gallery tours?<br></strong>Gallery tours are led by members of the Art Institute staff as well as artists and external partners and educators who are deeply knowledgeable about art, the Art Institute collection, and creative practice. They are dynamic presenters trained to connect people with art in ways that are fun, accessible, thought-provoking, and relevant to our everyday lives. Educators love discussing art and design their own tours so that each experience is unique and enriched by the interests of the educator and our visitors.&nbsp;</p>",
