The artist drew the innkeeper\u2019s portrait as he sat, facing forward, with a drink in his hand. A few days earlier Whistler had selected much the same pose for his lithographic portrait of the elderly George Govier, The Master Smith (cat. 120). When he finished the portrait of Grove, Whistler departed from his usual practice and inscribed the sitter\u2019s name and the name of the hotel at the right of the image.\n\nJohn Grove was transferred to stone and proved on 5 October 1895 (app. II.4). By October 10 Whistler had received the first proofs of this and three other lithographs. He was disappointed with the images, as he had been with the proofs of his first seven Lyme Regis lithographs (cat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125). He wrote immediately to the Ways, instructing them to print no more impressions of the last four lithographs and to refrain from showing the images to anyone (letter 145). He concluded his brief letter by saying: \u201cThe Landlord is bad doubtless my fault entirely.\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (250 \u00d7 182 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (247 \u00d7 192 mm), signed.
