    "copy": " Tuesday, July 25, 2017   CHICAGO \u2014From October 8, 2017 through January 7, 2018 , the Art Institute of Chicago will present the first-ever North American exhibition devoted to the pivotal Brazilian artist Tarsila do Amaral (1886-1973). Tarsila, as she is known, is a paradigmatic figure in twentieth-century art whose groundbreaking work of the 1920s synthesized avant-garde aesthetics and Brazilian subjects to produce a powerful new modernism for her country. Among the most emblematic paintings of the Brazilian modern movement are A Negra (1923), Abaporu (1928), and Antropofagia ( Anthropophagy ) (1929); these icons all bear Tarsila\u2019s signature and will be on view in the exhibition, creating an extraordinary opportunity for global audiences to experience her influential work outside of Latin America. After the presentation at the Art Institute of Chicago, the exhibition will be on view at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, from February 11 through June 3, 2018.   Bringing together more than 70 of Tarsila\u2019s most important paintings and drawings from the 1920s, when she traveled between S\u00e3o Paulo and Paris to participate in the creative and social life of both cities, the exhibition offers a long-overdue introduction to Tarsila\u2019s defining achievements and takes as a core question how this distinctive and transformative artist remains largely unknown and yet deeply enriches and intensifies the cultural discourse and the complex course of global art history.   The exhibition in Chicago opens with a striking presentation of three landmark works that embody and set forth the themes that would drive Tarsila\u2019s oeuvre: A Negra (1923), Abaporu (1928), and Antropofagia ( Anthropophagy ) (1929). With those touchstones established, the exhibition continues with Tarsila\u2019s experience in Paris in 1923, highlighting works related to what she called her \u201cmilitary service in Cubism\u201d while under the tutelage of Albert Gleizes, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Andr\u00e9 Lhote. Next, it turns to focus on her Pau-Brasil period from 1924-1927, featuring sketches and photographs related to her trips to Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais and paintings inspired by a sense of rediscovery of Brazil. Continuing a deeper consideration of her landmark painting Abaporu (\u201cman who eats,\u201d in Tupi-Guarani) and Andrade\u2019s Manifesto antrop\u00f3fago , subsequent galleries include works that reflect her unique manifestation of European modernism inspired by Brazil and offered afresh in her most daring moment of production, culminating with the iconic Antropofagia (1929). The exhibition closes with a provocative contrast of works that illuminate the parallel paths defining the after-life of Brazilian modern art, featuring Operarios (1933), a monumental depiction of the working class and the end of Tarsila\u2019s highest moment of production.   The accompanying catalogue, the first in-depth English examination of Tarsila\u2019s artistic production, provides a fresh look at her most experimental and surprising creations with scholarly essays, full-color illustrations, documents and photographs of the period, and translations of critical texts and letters of the artist.
