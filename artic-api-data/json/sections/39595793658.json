The edition was printed in black on fine, grayish-ivory China paper. With a large proportion of absorbent filler used in the formation of the sheets, the paper was particularly conducive to absorbing the black printing ink from the block. Fillers in this type of paper were commonly clay- or chalk-based and had an affinity for the wet, tacky ink. In Pola\u2019s impressions, the ink was wiped very cleanly from the blocks, with the result that even the most finely incised lines that Gauguin made transferred precisely to paper. This also provides the present-day viewer with a clear understanding of the manufacture of the blocks\u2014constructed by adhering multiple smaller segments of wood together\u2014since many of the small gaps that had developed in them over time appear as fine white vertical and horizontal lines scattered throughout the impressions. Similarly, the prints document the damage\u2014small scratches and cracks\u2014suffered by the blocks before 1921 as well as minute, delicate incising added by a later hand to clean up the blocks, perhaps in anticipation of the posthumous printing.\n\nWhen placed side by side with the many unique impressions pulled by Gauguin, the impressions pulled by Pola lack tonal variation and differ greatly in appearance. Gauguin sought to obscure much of the gouged and incised detail carved into his blocks by unevenly and selectively inking them and by hand applying media to the block, the printed paper, or both. In contrast, Pola\u2019s impressions have a crisp accuracy and legibility that allow them to be used as road maps to better navigate the imagery that was very consciously obscured in Gauguin\u2019s impressions (fig. 54.4.2).\n\nSeveral segments of the block used for this print (1893\u201394; Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York), which was constructed from eight small pieces of end-grain boxwood, cracked or shifted out of plane at some point before the 1921 printing. These uninked areas resulted in visual breaks in the printed composition in the vertical direction 117 mm, 235 mm, and 323 mm in from the left edge, and in the horizontal direction 118 mm and 107 mm down from the top edge where the individual section of the block split. The block has suffered significant damage. A series of scratches are present in the lower left, a sharp diagonal scratch is present below the central fish, a large scratch extends between the two figures in the upper left, and hairline scratches are present through the monogram and in the upper right. The result of a significant flaw or damage in the block appears in the left side of the composition as uninked, ill-defined splotches that extend through the female figure. It is likely that the block warped or became misaligned, so that the inked roller did not come completely in contact with these areas.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 54.4.3).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 54.4.4).\n\nThe posthumous impressions were printed with ink that is a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue. The cool cast of the ink is attributable to blue pigment. The block was printed in a straightforward manner using a press. This undertaking was carried out in Copenhagen by the publisher Christian Cato; according to Pola Gauguin the blocks were printed using \u201ca book press and two cylinders, one of moistened rubber and one of hard leather.\u201d It is quite apparent that this impression was printed with a hard leather roller so the ink would remain on the surface of the block rather than slip into the interstices. The consistency of the ink must have been quite tacky to sit on the surface of the block in this way. Because only the highest points were inked, the rings of the wood absorbed the ink selectively; as a result, they are visible in the lower left part of the composition.\n\nThe paper fibers in the thin, grayish-ivory China paper are more or less uniform, with minute fibrous inclusions throughout. Calcium carbonate (chalk) was used as a filler to give the sheet its opaque, matte appearance and soft, velvety feel. There is a series of brush marks incised into the paper. A hallmark of China paper, these brush marks form when a hard-bristled brush is used to brush out the paper onto a hard surface to dry. Dragging the brush through the chalk-laden paper results in the pattern of brushwork seen here (fig. 54.4.5). In transmitted light, a mold impression characteristic of China paper is visible; chain lines appear at various intervals across the sheet and laid lines are very fine and spaced close together. The distribution of the varied paper fibers is also visible. Under magnification the paper fibers appear long and evenly distributed throughout the sheet. Some darker fibers of various lengths can be seen throughout. The ink is evenly dispersed on the surface. Creases that formed in the printing process are readily visible and the lack of ink in overlapping areas of creasing is apparent. Embossment of the paper is pronounced in raking light. Surface shape studies of a number of Gauguin\u2019s wood-block prints, including this posthumous impression, were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed-camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, are combined to create an interactive composite image to capture the topography of the paper, the manner in which the ink sits on the paper, and the appearance of the paper fibers (see fig. 54.4.4). The Pola impressions were not printed with the same degree of variable pressure as that applied by Gauguin. Therefore, they are not as deeply embossed as the lifetime impressions examined for this study. However, the paper in the image area exhibits pressure-induced undulations associated with the use of a press and the significant pressure exerted to print the block.\n\nIn 1938 Pola outlined his trials and tribulations as he worked out his method to print his father\u2019s blocks. He stated that he purchased the blocks in 1919, and it must have been under the guidance of the Cato firm that he came to familiarize himself with the China paper favored by printers the world over by the late nineteenth century. Given the nuance and skill required to print such fine impressions, it is inconceivable to the authors that Pola printed the blocks alone without relying upon the expertise he found in Cato\u2019s firm.\n\n205 \u00d7 355 mm (image); 269 \u00d7 426 mm (sheet). The image was centered on the sheet with substantial borders of approximately 30 mm on each side. The sheet has hand-torn deckled edges along the left and top edges. The right and bottom edges were not cut down, and along both there are traces of red ink of the type customarily used to add export stamps to the outside of a large bundled stack of paper. It is likely that large sheets of China paper were cut in half or into quarters to provide sheets of dimensions appropriate for printing Gauguin\u2019s elongated blocks. For this impression, the printer appears to have cut a large sheet of paper into quarters.\n\nThe publisher gave careful consideration to the manner of presentation of this group of wood-block prints. The images were centered on the large sheets of China paper with ample borders on all sides. The sheets of China paper were in turn pasted onto sturdy sheets of mottled blue wove paper in each corner (fig. 54.4.6). Blue fibrous inclusions appear throughout (fig. 54.4.7). Ample borders were again provided. The choice of this paper for mounting was not a random one, but one quite common in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It also reflected Gauguin\u2019s own preference for mounting a number of his prints, including some from his Noa Noa Suite and multiple impressions of Oviri (see cat. 84.3 and cat. 84.4). Once mounted, the ten prints and a letterpress title page were placed in a portfolio constructed of gray millboard adorned with the cartouche from another plate in the suite, Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), on the cover (fig. 54.4.8).\n\nPosthumous impressions in the Art Institute of Chicago are no longer mounted, the title page (fig. 54.4.9) was trimmed, and only the top of the portfolio cover (fig. 54.4.10) is extant; it, too, was trimmed.\n\nThe print is in very good condition overall. There are small losses in the upper left and upper right corners, and a larger loss that measures 8 mm along the right edge starting 53 mm down from the upper right corner. There is a pronounced vertical crease in the margin at bottom center and a smaller diagonal crease at bottom right that formed during printing. Neither extends into the image. On the verso there are various hinges adhered along the top (see fig. 54.4.1). There is slight golden yellow staining on the recto from these hinges. There is also a water stain in the upper right caused by the hinging adhesive. Examination under ultraviolet light reveals some foxing on both the recto and verso. The foxing predominates in the upper third of the sheet. The majority of foxing appears on the recto. These areas fluoresce less brightly than the rest of the paper. The paper is lighter where a mat protected it from light exposure. An area one-half-inch in width all around the image fluoresces darker than the rest of the sheet.  \nHarriet K.

This brings the total number of states to three.\n\nGauguin returned to Tahiti with the blocks for Te atua (The God) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love); for this reason they were not included in Pola\u2019s edition.\n\nIt was previously suggested that block was composed of somewhere between six to ten sections. See Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 82. The block is in the collection of the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon. To return to the original view, click on the return icon (semicircle with arrow).\n\nPigment analysis of the ink was carried out using FTIR on Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.5) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.4). Carbon black was identified as likely, and is mixed with Prussian blue. See C\u00e9line Daher, XRF analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. Although these were the only posthumous prints analyzed, visual examination of multiple examples of posthumous impressions revealed that these works were all printed with the same type of ink. The tonality of the ink and its appearance on the paper are the same in all of them.\n\nElizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), pp. 48\u201349.\n\nXRF analysis identified calcium carbonate (chalk) as the filler in Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.5) and Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.4). See C\u00e9line Daher, XRF analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.

Mellon Foundation. The work of Xiang Huang, who spent countless hours assembling the RTI images that appear in this publication, is especially acknowledged.

In the essay Pola expands upon what he had written in his 1935 letter to Jean-Gabriel Daragn\u00e8s, published in Arts et m\u00e9tiers m\u00e9tiers graphiques 49 (Oct. 15, 1935), p. 40.\n\nCorrespondence dated April 2014 between Christine Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld) and Sten Rasmussen (buyer of NB Offset A/S and by descent the Cato Lithographic Establishment) states that he acquired a set of Pola impressions from the Cato archives along with the business. A document among Carl Schneiwind\u2019s papers held in the Art Institute of Chicago, Department of Prints and Drawings, states that Pola lived next door to Cato and that \u201cCato probably made [the] Pola ed.\u201d\n\nEdgar Degas owned prints from the Noa Noa Suite that were mounted on mottled blue paper.

The portfolio cover is intact. See also Commentary.\n\nAn intact example of the portfolio in the collection of the British Museum, London, was examined for this study. The observations made here are based on that examination.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into Pola Gauguin\u2019s posthumous edition of the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nHarriet Stratis, condition report, 1995, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 54.4 L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created), from the Noa Noa Suite, 1893/94.\n\nfig. 54.4.3 Gauguin\u2019s L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (1893/94, printed and published 1921).
