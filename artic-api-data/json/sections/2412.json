The work of hammering an ingot of silver into a flat sheet of consistent thickness was one of the craftsman\u2019s most arduous tasks. Early American salvers that survive were owned by some of the colonies\u2019 wealthiest residents. These large-sized trays were used in the service of coffee, tea, or other refreshment, and their flat, expansive surfaces offered excellent opportunities for armorial engravings or interlaced monograms. The form underwent something of a shift during the first quarter of the eighteenth century, when three or four small cast feet replaced the central, trumpet-shaped support typical of earlier salvers. On the present object, four claw-and-ball feet similar to those found on contemporary furniture coordinate neatly with the cast and applied border of ruffled shells, rosettes, leaves, and gadrooning. With its bright-cut, shield-shaped cartouche and floral swags, this salver reflects the stylistic transition from Rococo to Neoclassicism.\n\nThe salver is marked by New York City silversmith William Grigg, who became a freeman of the city in 1765, permitting him to open a retail shop, vote, and hold political office. Grigg worked in both New York City and Albany before relocating to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in the 1780s with other loyalists. His return to New York was announced in the New-York Daily Gazette, where on February 11, 1789, he advertised, \u201cJust Opened, and for Sale by William Grigg, At the House lately occupied by Mr. Joseph Henry at the Corner of Maiden-Lane and William-Street, a large Assortment of Plate, Plated Ware, Jewellery and other Goods.\u201d The list of articles cited is extensive, ranging from silver coffeepots, tankards, and sauceboats to bridle bits, wedding rings, silversmith\u2019s tools, shoe buckles, and japanned tea urns, tea trays, and waiters. The advertisement continues by offering \u201cA handsome Assortment of PICTURES, Framed and unframed,\u201d as well as \u201cVIOLIN MUSIC . . . composed by the best composers in England, . . . LIKEWISE Spinets, Guitars, Violins.\u201d His ability to stock such a vast array of goods certainly suggests that Grigg was both a merchant and a silversmith, and likely an importer, too, as indicated by earlier advertisements proclaiming, \u201cJust imported, and to be sold by William Grigg.\u201d Like so many of his fellow silversmiths, Grigg supplemented his income by expanding his business beyond silver wares.\n\nRemarkably similar in design and dimensions to the Grigg salver is a London-made example date-marked 1766/67 (see fig. 34.1), which was owned in colonial New York by the De Peyster family. Fashioned by Thomas Hannam and John Crouch, specialist makers of salvers and trays, the London tray is engraved at its center with a foliate script monogram, MDP, probably for Margaret De Peyster, who in 1776 married Colonel Thomas James, commander of the British Regiment of the Royal Artillery. Another salver of almost identical design and dimensions bears the mark of New York silversmith John Heath, about whom little is known. The Heath example is engraved with the arms of another prominent New York family, the Schuylers, within a Rococo surround. Also of nearly identical design is a small waiter measuring 7 3/4 inches in diameter and bearing the mark of New York silversmith Andrew Underhill, made for William Cockcroft and his wife, Margaret Van Dam.\n\nThe coat of arms and crest engraved on the Grigg salver are those of Clarkson. Having descended in the family through many generations, the salver was sold at auction in 1947 along with other Clarkson heirlooms. In a letter dated April 12, 1947, the consignor, Christopher Blackburn Miller (1885\u20131957), indicated that the salver belonged originally to either David Clarkson (1693/94\u20131751) or his grandson General Matthew Clarkson (1758\u20131825). However, taking into account the line through which the salver appears to have descended, a likelier candidate is General Clarkson\u2019s uncle\u2014his father\u2019s brother\u2014also named Matthew Clarkson (1733\u20131772), from whom Miller\u2019s mother, Pauline Rives Clarkson Miller (1856\u20131932), traced a direct descent.\n\nThe elder Matthew Clarkson was the son of David Clarkson (1694\u20131751) and Anna Margaret Freeman (1706\u20131759). He was married in 1758 to Elizabeth De Peyster (1737\u20131775), introducing the intriguing possibility that the design of this salver might be related to the London example noted above, which belonged to Elizabeth\u2019s niece Margaret. The younger Matthew was the son of David Clarkson, Jr. (1726\u20131782), and Elizabeth French (1724\u20131808). A distinguished army officer and longtime president of the Bank of New York, as well as a respected political leader and philanthropist, Matthew Clarkson was\u2014like his uncle\u2014a vestryman of Trinity Church, in whose churchyard he is buried. In 1785 he married Mary Rutherfurd, who died in childbirth the following year. In 1792 he took as his second wife Sarah (Sally) Cornell (1761\u20131803), daughter of Samuel and Susannah Mabson Cornell, who were important patrons of New York silversmith Myer Myers (see cat. 24 and cat. 25). In a society as interconnected as that of eighteenth-century New York, it should come as no surprise that Matthew\u2019s parents owned a handsome covered silver jug made for them by Myers, many of whose clients came from the city\u2019s upper echelons.  \nBeth Carver Wees\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom (fig. 34.2)\n\nEngraved on body: arms and crest of Clarkson family\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Probably Matthew Clarkson (1733\u20131772) or Matthew Clarkson (1758\u20131825), New York.\n\nBy descent to Pauline Rives Clarkson Miller (1856\u20131932).\n\nBy descent to her son Christopher Blackburn Miller (1885\u20131957).\n\nSold at auction, Yonkers, NY, 1947.\n\nWith James Graham and Sons, New York, by 1951.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1951.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, The Antiquarian Society: The First One Hundred Years, April 23\u2013June 19, 1977, cat. 194 (as \u201cTray\u201d).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Antiques (1947), p. 127 (ill.).\n\nComstock (1947), p. 113 (ill.).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago (1951), p. 48.\n\nWinchester (1970), frontispiece (ill.), p. 393.\n\nEllesin (1973), p. 687 (ill.).\n\nTvrdik (1977), pp. 158\u201359, cat. 194 (ill.).\n\nQuimby and Johnson (1995), p. 244.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See, for instance, a salver made in 1754\u201369 by Daniel Christian Fueter for a member of the Provost family of New York, Wees and Harvey (2013), cat. 98; one fashioned about 1765 by John Heath for a member of the Schuyler family, Quimby and Johnson (1995), cat. 209, Barquist, Butler, and Sarna (2001), cat. 109; and one executed by Lewis Fueter (Daniel Christian\u2019s son) in 1772\u201373, engraved with the seal of New York City, presented to engineer Captain Thomas Sowers, Hofer et al.

This same advertisement was repeated regularly for the following six months.\n\nNew-York Gazette, and Weekly Mercury, October 23, 1780, p. 3. Grigg is in fact listed in Longworth (1796), p. 199, as a \u201cmerchant,\u201d and in Low (1796), p. 80, as a \u201chardware merchant.\u201d In both directories, his address is given as 61 Maiden-Lane.\n\nThis salver is in the collection of the New-York Historical Society (1911.52). Hannam and Crouch, who worked in partnership from about 1766 to 1793, also produced cast candlesticks, especially during the early years of their collaboration. See Grimwade (1976/1982), pp. 480, 533. Similar salvers marked by Hannam and Crouch survive, as do related examples marked by the specialist salver maker Richard Rugg, with whom Crouch apprenticed; see, for instance, Freeman\u2019s (2010), lot 323. A Rugg salver of somewhat similar design although lacking the decorative inner border belonged to the Philipse family of New York. See K. Johnson (1996), pp. 18\u201319, 36.\n\nSee note 1 for reference to the Heath salver.\n\nWaters, McKinsey, and G.

Hanks, then assistant curator at the Art Institute of Chicago, July 5 and 21, 1971. Hatch purchased two tankards and a pair of sauceboats at the sale; curatorial files, Department of American Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nC.

This same history was suggested by Bernard and S. Dean Levy of New York City, whose catalogue Selections from the Collection of Vincent Dyckman Andrus included \u201cthe Matthew Clarkson\u201d serpentine front card table.
