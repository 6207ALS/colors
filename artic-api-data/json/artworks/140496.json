Goff\u2019s correspondence with Frank Lloyd Wright fueled his independent drive, and projects from his teenage years show a remarkably sophisticated understanding of the Prairie School vocabulary of his mentor, as seen in this dramatic study for a small house.<br>Presented from an aerial perspective, Goff\u2019s drawing highlights a choreographed procession from interior to exterior, as the stained-glass doors lead to a large, symmetrical porch with trailing flowerboxes and a reflecting pool.</p>\n",
