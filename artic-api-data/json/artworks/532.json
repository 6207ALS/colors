    "description": "<p>Initially affordable only among the wealthy, glass was used in ancient Rome as containers for oils, perfume, and tablewares. The variety of glass-making techniques reveals the changing tastes and fashions over the centuries. During the 1st century A.D., cast glass was a novel form that was a luxury for the Roman household, but by the end of the century, the innovation of blown glass allowed for less labor-intensive and less expensive production of glass wares like this bottle, which meant people of lesser means could afford them. Blown glass became so popular it nearly supplanted ceramic and even bronze wares in the home.</p>\n",
