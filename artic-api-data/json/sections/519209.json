Trajan\u2019s wife, Plotina, a supporter of Hadrian, had arranged their marriage, which took place around A.D. 100. The marriage of Sabina and Hadrian was childless, and although the nature of their private relationship remains unclear, later sources purport that they shared a mutual distaste for one another, and that Hadrian treated Sabina rather shabbily. However, Hadrian honored her in the customary manner by acknowledging her as Augusta in A.D. 128 and even ordered her posthumous deification, an event celebrated with the first known depiction of an imperial woman\u2019s apotheosis. Sabina also accompanied Hadrian on many of his extensive travels throughout the empire, both before and after he became ruler of Rome. With her mother, Matidia, grandmother Marciana, and great-aunt Plotina, Sabina enjoyed the company of educated and cosmopolitan men and women in Rome. These included the biographer Suetonius, whom Hadrian is reported to have sent away from the court for having been too friendly with her.\n\nHadrian began minting coins in Sabina\u2019s name after he was honored with the title pater patriae in A.D. 128. In 133 he seems to have assigned her direction of one officina or workshop of the mint\u2014signaled by the appearance of her name alone on the obverse of this coin. The coin was minted soon after they returned from the great tour of the empire in 134.\n\nSabina\u2019s coin portraits include a variety of hairstyles. On earlier issues her hair is arranged in contemporary styles, also seen on portraits of her mother and grandmother\u2014emphasizing the family resemblance, and thus Hadrian\u2019s right to rule through his adoption by Trajan. On this coin, she had herself portrayed with a simpler hairdo, identified as Greek in style, reflecting the philhellene tastes of the imperial court under Hadrian. Perhaps by this point the imperial couple no longer felt the need to defend the legitimacy of Hadrian\u2019s reign, the success of which, by now, spoke for itself.\n\nAn alternative possibility would support the hypothesis that Sabina felt underappreciated. Her long, austere hairdo on this coin bears a notable resemblance to that seen on coins of Agrippina the Elder (d. A.D. 33), granddaughter of Augustus and wife of the greatly admired general Germanicus (see cat. 37, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Gaius (Caligula)). Agrippina, a woman of excellent character, had died exiled and wronged by Emperor Tiberius. Is it possible that the likeness was intentional, and that Sabina meant herself to be seen as yet another noblewoman who suffered from the unfairness of imperial men?\n\nOn this coin she is associated with the queen of the gods; the inscription reads \u201c[To] Juno the Queen.\u201d  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Historia Augusta Hadrian 11.3; Epitome Caesaribus 14.8. A balanced reassessment of their relationship may be found in Burns, Great Women of Imperial Rome, pp. 125\u201338, esp. 134\u201346. There remains, however, much disagreement among historians on this issue.\n\nThis is the likeliest date. Thorsten Opper, however, suggested that Sabina might have received the title as early as A.D. 119, following the death of her mother, Matidia: Opper, Hadrian: Empire and Conflict, p. 203. The title of Augusta was the highest honor that could be conferred on a woman of the imperial family. It was not automatically the title of the consort of the emperor but could be held by his sisters, his mother, and other female relations.\n\nThe relief sculpture is in the Musei Capitolini, Museo del Palazzo dei Conservatori, Rome, inv. MC1213. Sabina\u2019s deification was also represented on coins.\n\nBurns, Great Women of Imperial Rome, pp. 125, 128, 135.\n\nHistoria Augusta Hadrian 11.3.\n\nSee Hill, Dating and Arrangement, p. 3. It is intriguing to think of the mechanisms by which coin portraits were decided. Women or other members of the imperial family who controlled officinae of the mint, such as Sabina and Faustina I, may have had no say in monetary policy but a great deal of freedom to choose portraits, reverse types, and inscriptions.\n\nCarandini, Vibia Sabina, pp. 106, 237; Fittschen and Zanker, Katalog der r\u00f6mischen Portr\u00e4ts 3, p. 10, cat. 9.\n\nDillon, Female Portrait Statue, p. 159.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 51 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Empress Sabina, A.D. 134\n\n</section>",
