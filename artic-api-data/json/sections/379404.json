Their rooms at the top of the elegant hotel afforded them expansive views of the Victoria Embankment and the Thames. Working on transfer paper, Whistler drew two views of Waterloo Bridge, this image and another scene recorded at dawn (cat. 156). Although captured from slightly different vantage points within the hotel, both views look east from the Savoy to where Waterloo Bridge spans the Thames, linking the Embankment to the warehouses and wharves crowding the south side of the river.\n\nSavoy Pigeons (cat. 154) and Evening, Little Waterloo Bridge are probably the earliest of Whistler\u2019s Savoy lithographs. On 11 March 1896 Whistler sold proofs of these two images to Wunderlich\u2019s in New York. In a letter written a few days later to Edward Kennedy, he described the two lithographs as \u201cfresh out of the oven.\u201d In all likelihood, they are the two subjects that were transferred and proved by the Ways on March 10 (app. II.4).\n\nIn Evening, Little Waterloo Bridge, the sense of fading daylight is evoked by the long shadows beneath the piers of the bridge and by their reflections in the water on the near side of the bridge. Once the drawing had been transferred, Whistler worked directly on the stone in the Ways\u2019 nearby offices on Wellington Street, using crayon and a stump to enhance the effect of twilight\u2019s darkening skies and gathering mists.\n\nIn the image as originally drawn and transferred, before additions to the stone, there are traces of stump work on the far right side of the bridge and in the sky, although the latter were too delicate to transfer effectively and print consistently.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (202 \u00d7 314 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (229 \u00d7 283 mm), signed. Washington: NGA, cream laid paper (230 \u00d7 284 mm), signed.\n\nRevisions have been made directly on the stone with both crayon and stump. The majority of the additions were made in the sky to suggest cloud formations. The far shore has been extended and further delineated. Additions have been made to suggest smoke and mist across the river above the shoreline. The buildings at right on the distant bank have been strengthened in tone.\n\nChicago: SC, ivory laid paper (199 \u00d7 323 mm).
