    "short_description": "In 1887 Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939) arrived in Paris with few contacts and no credentials to pursue a career as an art dealer. He began representing artists that were undervalued, exhibiting them at a time when many galleries were not willing to take the risk. In 1895 Vollard hosted C\u00e9zanne\u2019s first solo exhibition, and in doing so he made the artist\u2019s reputation as well as his own.",
