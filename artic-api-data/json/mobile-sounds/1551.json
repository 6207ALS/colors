    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The British artist J.M.W. Turner was fascinated by the sea and returned to it as a subject throughout his life. Former Director, Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK:  The sea is a subject that allows you to explore light and color, to explore the atmospheric conditions which he loved to try to depict in his painting. The sky is a great tour de force in terms of the suggestion of the various moods of nature from ominous in those dark, dark clouds to the left, to the more nurturing blue that one sees through the break in the clouds. And I think one of the great wonders of this picture is the way that when you stand before it, you get the sense of the great surges and swells of the sea and you can almost feel like you're standing on board.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  On this horizon is a steam ship. At this time, the 1830s, steam power was a fairly new technology. During the 19th century it would revolutionize seafaring, liberating sailors to some extent from the vagaries of nature.</p>\n",
