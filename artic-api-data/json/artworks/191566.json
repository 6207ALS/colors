It is possible that this is Octavie Josephine Macedo-Carvalho (1833\u20131909; n\u00e9e Marchand). She was the mistress of the important art dealer and collector George Aloysius Lucas (1824\u20131909), who moved to Paris in 1857. He maintained her apartment across the hall from his own, and the two shared a servant. Reportedly, cooking for both households was done in Lucas\u2019s apartment, as Carvalho\u2019s kitchen was stuffed with Lucas\u2019s art collection. Therefore, it is possible that someone knew the picture was in Carvalho\u2019s apartment but never made the connection to George A. Lucas. See Holly Selby and James Bock, \u201cLucas\u2019 Will, The Fight over George A. Lucas Collection Comes Down to One Question: Does the Lucas art belong in Baltimore forever? THE LUCAS COLLECTION: WHAT DID HE REALLY WANT?,\u201d The Baltimore Sun, Mar. 19, 1995, accessed online Jan. 25, 2016, https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1995-03-19-1995078030-story.html. In addition to assembling his own significant collection of Manet prints, Lucas helped Samuel P. Avery (1822\u20131904) and William T. Walters (1820\u20131894) form their collections. Avery amassed a collection of 17,775 etchings and lithographs representing 978 artists, many of them French, and gave his collection of prints to the New York Public Library in 1900. Following his death in 1894, Walters bequeathed bequeathed his extensive collection to his son, Henry Walters, who established the Walters Art Gallery, now called The Walters Art Museum, in Baltimore, Maryland.].  Th\u00e9odore Duret (1838\u20131927), Paris [Tabarant 1931].  Auguste Pellerin (1853\u20131929), Paris, by 1902 [Duret 1902]; probably sold to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, spring 1910 [Auguste Pellerin was an active collector, buying and trading pictures for more than twenty-five years, frequently through Bernheim-Jeune. In spring 1910 Pellerin sold much of his Manet collection to a consortium of art dealers comprised of Bernheim-Jeune and Durand-Ruel, both in Paris, and Paul Cassirer, in Berlin. See Julius Meier-Graefe, Kunst ist nicht f\u00fcr Kunstgeschichte da: Briefe und Dokumente, ed. Catherine Krahmer (Wallstein, 2001), p. 374. In June of that year, Bernheim-Jeune exhibited thirty-five works by Manet from the Pellerin collection. See Bernheim-Jeune, Manet: Trente-cinq tableaux de la collection Pellerin (Paris, 1910). This pastel was not included, but another pastel portrait, L\u2019Homme Blond (Duret no. 75) was shown. If Pellerin had still owned The Man with the Dog at that time, it seems likely that it, too, would have been included.].  Lefevre Galleries (Alex. Reid & Lefevre), London, by May 1924 [London 1924].
