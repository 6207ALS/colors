The sheet is still its original size; it was not trimmed after the watercolor was executed, as evidenced by the accumulation of media along all four edges (fig. 15.1). Transmitted infrared digital photography shows that the graphite underdrawing is sparse and concentrated in the details of the sitter\u2019s face and hand (fig. 15.2). The blues and greens of the background were largely applied wet-in-wet. Manet used a narrow brush, as indicated by the width of some brushstrokes that are visible behind the figure\u2019s head and above her proper left shoulder. The translucency of her skin tone was achieved with a very thin wash, which allows the bright paper to reflect light back through the media and for the paper\u2019s tone to serve as highlights where it was left bare. Manet applied black watercolor last, using a relatively dry brush in order to preserve the opacity of his paint. In some small passages, the artist used a scumbling technique to evoke a translucent fabric or lace (fig. 15.3).\n\nA brown watercolor wash was applied to the verso of this sheet (fig. 15.4). It is unclear why Manet prepared the support but then chose to use the pristine side. The verso perimeter was sanded, presumably when the drawing was removed from a mount in 1964 (fig. 15.5).\n\nWatercolor over traces of graphite.\n\nOff-white, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\n209 mm \u00d7 168 mm\n\nThere are small graphite tick marks in the centers of each of the recto edges.\n\nThe number 1 is written in graphite on top of the brown watercolor wash in the lower right corner (fig. 15.4).\n\nManet overlapped transparent washes of black, brown, green, and blue watercolors while wet in the background. Guided by his graphite sketch, the artist left the areas for the figure and the fan in reserve. He then executed a slightly more detailed sketch in these areas in a dark-brown watercolor. Next he applied black, blue, and red-brown undertones in the dress and fan; modulated the darks and lights of the hair with an orange-brown hue; and applied the warm pink and peach tones of the skin. All of these colors were applied with a brush. It appears that Manet did not wait for one color to dry before applying the next, as colors comingle where their edges meet and pool (fig. 15.6). As a final step, he applied a dense black watercolor with a drier brush to create contrast and add the darkest shadows. Under high magnification, these layers are visible (fig. 15.7).\n\nThe oil painting (fig. 15.8) that relates to this sketch features a nearly identical composition, and its dimensions are in an almost exact 3:1 proportion to those of this work on paper. Berthe Morisot attempted a copy of Manet\u2019s oil, which is partially visible on the back of her Young Girl with Blond Hair.\n\nShortly after its acquisition by the Art Institute in 1964, the work was sent to the Extra Bindery Department at R. R. Donnelley and Sons, where it was removed from a secondary support.\n\nThe support\u2019s left recto edge is hand torn. The other three edges are cut cleanly, although they are not perfectly straight. The reason for the sanding along the perimeter of the verso is unclear. It may have been a means of obscuring damage to the sheet caused by its removal from a backing board. The combination of the abrasion and the brown watercolor wash on the verso gives the sheet an uneven appearance in transmitted light.\n\nThe media is in sound, stable condition. There is a shiny adhesive accretion in the lower left recto corner along the left edge, which is visible in raking light.  \nMary Broadway\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly Jean-Baptiste Faure (1830\u20131914), Paris, probably after 1902, but by Sept. 1906.\n\nPaul Cassirer (1871\u20131926), Berlin, by 1910.\n\nGiven by Paul Cassirer to his wife Tilla Durieux-Cassirer (n\u00e9e Ottilie Godefroy; 1880\u20131971), Berlin, by 1922.\n\nReturned by Tilla Durieux-Cassirer to the Cassirer family, 1926.\n\nPlaced on consignment by Paul Cassirer\u2019s daughter, Suzanne Aim\u00e9e Bernfeld (n\u00e9e Cassirer; 1896\u20131963), to Walter Feilchenfeldt (1894\u20131953) of Paul Cassirer, Amsterdam, Mar. 1935.\n\nSold by Walter Feilchenfeldt of Paul Cassirer, Amsterdam, to Margarete Oppenheim (1857\u20131935), Berlin, June 1935.\n\nBy descent to her stepdaughter, Martha Oppenheim\u2013von Simson (1882\u20131971), Berlin.\n\nTo her daughter, Vita Petersen (n\u00e9e von Simson; 1915\u20132011), New York, by 1937.\n\nVita Petersen to Justin K.

The exhibition appeared at the Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille and the Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Martigny.\n\nA Chicago institution since 1864, the publishing and printing house R. R. Donnelley and Sons owned and operated a restoration and conservation studio called the Extra Bindery Department. The Art Institute occasionally sent artworks with a high monetary value there for treatment until 1972, when the museum hired David Chandler, its first highly trained paper conservator.\n\nThe drawing was not included in Notice sur la Collection J.-B Faure suivie du catalogue des Tableaux formant cette Collection (Imprimerie Fran\u00e7aise. J. Dangon, 1902). With twenty-one works by Manet, including three watercolors, it seems likely that this work would have been included in the publication had Faure owned it at the time. The drawing may have been in his collection by September 1906. See Berlin, Paul Cassirer, Manet-Monet Ausstellung, Sept. 22\u2013Oct. 28, 1906, cat. 22; Bernhard Echte and Walter Feilchenfeldt, eds., Kunstsalon Paull Cassirer: Die Ausstellungen 1908\u20131910 (Nimbus, 2013), pp. 247 (ill.), 769, no. 22. Although the drawing was certainly exhibited in Berlin and later at the follow-up exhibition in Stuttgart, it was not recorded on the loan list provided by Durand-Ruel. Walter Feilchenfeldt notes that it could have been owned privately by Paul Cassirer and not by Faure as the inclusion in the exhibition would suggest. Walter Feilchenfeldt to the Art Institute of Chicago, Jul. 30, 2015, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. According to Charles S. Moffett, \"Le chanteur espagnol ou Le guitarero,\" in Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1983), p. 67, cat. 10, Jean-Baptiste Faure was a celebrated baritone, \u201cwho had formed an impressive collection of Barbizon School paintings that he dispersed during the 1870s when he discovered the emerging artistic talents of Manet and the Impressionists. Indeed, Faure became the most important single collector of Manet\u2019s pictures and owned no fewer that sixty-seven of them at one time or another.\u201d\n\nAccording to Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, \"Berthe Morisot \u00e0 l'\u00e9ventail,\" in Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S.
