    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: American After the Fall, \u201cAspiration\u201d by Aaron Douglas. And to the left \u201cAmerican Justice\u201d by Joe Jones, 1933.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY OEHLER:  Aaron Douglas was an African-American artist, and like many others at this time, he felt that African-Americans were not being represented in every day histories of the United States. But he also felt that it was important to represent them in a positive light. Now the entire painting has been done in this very modern style. It\u2019s an extraordinary work of art. The three figures at center are contemporary men and a woman who hold the tools of their educational training. And they\u2019re looking towards an industrial city on a hill. Below them are hands reaching up and those hands have been manacled.</p>\n<p>Sarah Kelly Oehler:  Douglas is reflecting on the history of slavery in the United States and how all of the aspirations of current generations of African-Americans is built upon a history of slavery, that still needs to be overcome. But can be overcome as he suggests in these paintings.</p>\n<p>Judy Barter:  The late twenties and thirties there was a great deal of migration from the South of African-Americans to cities in the north, to Los Angeles, to Detroit, to Chicago. They were in constant debt. They couldn\u2019t own their land and so they left for a better life. And that\u2019s what \u201cAspiration\u201d is about.</p>\n",
