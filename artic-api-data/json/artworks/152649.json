Jesse Timmendequas, who had been previously convicted of sex crimes involving young girls, told police that on July 29, 1994, he lured the seven-year-old into his home, across the street from the Kanka family residence, by offering to show her a puppy. \n\nThe Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation, established by Megan\u2019s family, has fought for legislation requiring sex offenders to register with local police who must then inform communities of their presence. \n\nThe Hamilton Township Rotary Club tore down the house and built this park as a memorial to Megan.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
