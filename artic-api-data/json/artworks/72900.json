    "description": "<p>Henry Moore\u2019s seven-decade artistic career began with his early interest in non-Western art. Initially inspired by the African, Oceanic, and especially Pre-Columbian art that he saw at the British Museum in London, Moore, like <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33735\">Constantin Br\u00e2ncusi</a>, became a passionate proponent of direct carving, a technique that allowed the inherent qualities of materials to dictate a sculpture\u2019s final form. In the 1930s, Moore merged his interest in non-Western art with aspects of abstraction and Surrealism, which he encountered during his regular trips to Paris. Works like <em>Figure</em> reveal Moore\u2019s engagement with the organic, biomorphic forms used by contemporary Surrealist artists such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40418\">Jean Arp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34643\">Alberto Giacometti</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/32048\">Joan Mir\u00f3</a>.</p>\n",
