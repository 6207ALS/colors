    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the central panel of this magnificent triptych or three-part painting the Virgin Mary holds up the infant Christ. The flanking wings include later episodes in Christ\u2019s life. To the right, we see the crucifixion. At the top of the left panel Chris rises up to heaven while Adam and Eve cling to his robe. Beneath them St. George on a white horse battles a dragon. The triptych was made in the late seventeenth century in central Ethiopia where orthodox Christianity was established in the fourth century. Veneration of the Virgin Mary is a strong feature of Ethiopian Christian practice to this day. In the seventeenth century large triptychs like this were probably used as church icons. Smaller versions were commissioned by individuals for personal prayer and protection. In its three-part form, subject matter and pose of the virgin and child the triptych follows Western artistic conventions. These were brought to Ethiopia by Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. But it also contains many elements unique to the culture in which it was made. These include the flat bed on which the virgin sits. It is covered in a checkered pattern that is also found in Ethiopian church decoration. Christ\u2019s necklace is made from Cowry shells. To this day, Ethiopians place such necklaces around children\u2019s necks to ward off evil. The depiction of the figures is also distinctive. They are strongly outlined with bold flattened areas of shading and decorative linear patterning especially in the figure\u2019s robes.</p>\n",
