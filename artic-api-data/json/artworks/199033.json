    "description": "<p>Text printed on reverse of stereocard:</p>\n<p>THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C.<br>Derives its name from its founder, Mr. James Smithson, an English gentleman who died at Genoa, in the year 1828, leaving his entire property, amounting to $515,169, for the purpose of &quot;founding at Washington, an establishment, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.&quot;  This fund came into the possession of the United States Government, September, 1, 1838.  The corner-stone of the building was laid May 1, 1847.<br>The Smithsonian Institution is built on a public reservation, known as &quot;The Mall,&quot; between the Capitol and the Washington Monument,  The grounds extend from 7th Street to 12th Street, comprising 52 acres.  The greater portion of this area was laid out under the direction of the late distinguished horticulturalist and landscape gardener, Mr. Downing, to whose memory a Marble Vase, bearing the name of the Downing Vase, has been erected by the United States Pomological Society, at a cost of $2,000.<br>The material used in the construction of the building is a lilac-gray variety of freestone, found near the month of the Seneca Creek, one of the tributaries of the Potomac, about 23 miles from Washington.  The architecture is of the style known as Romanesque.<br>The building consists of a centre building, two stories high, 205 feet by 57 feet, and two wings, connected by intervening ranges, each 60 feet by 49 feet.  The east wing is 82 feet by 52 feet; the west wing is 84 feet by 40 feet, making the entire length of the building 447 feet from east to west, while the greatest breadth is 160 feet.<br>There are nine towers upon the building, of which two are in the north front of the centre building.  One of these reaches an elevation of 145 feet, and from it, beautiful panoramic views of the city may be obtained.<br>The Museum is the most attractive feature of the institution.  It occupies the lower story of the centre building, and contains the type specimens brought by the exploring expeditions of the United States.  It also illustrates the natural productions of this Continent.<br>Among the articles of interest in this collection may be found wax figures representation Dr. Kane among the Esquimaux; a Japanese Warrior in the costume of this country; and an Indian Chief.<br>In the second story is a Collection of stuffed animals, containing fine specimens of Buffalo, Elk, &amp;c.</p>\n",
