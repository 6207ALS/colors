Each artist explored the use of discrete brushstrokes and strong colors in innovative ways, and in turn developed novel styles of painting. Van Gogh followed the developments of Seurat and Signac, absorbing many of these approaches into their later painting styles.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 x 8.5 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Poster Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;11 x 14 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Premium cardstock</li>\n</ul>",
