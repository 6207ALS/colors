    "short_description": "In Japan, metal craftsmen who had previously made a living fashioning elaborate armor and sword fittings or casting bronze Buddhist sculptures found a new and more viable outlet for their talents, creating pieces for world\u2019s fairs and domestic exhibitions. Items including realistic bronze sculptures of animals and utilitarian items such as incense burners and cloisonn\u00e9 vases were among the most astounding technical achievements on view at such venues. In addition to metalwork, porcelain items became more intricate in terms of shape, design, and breadth of color.",
