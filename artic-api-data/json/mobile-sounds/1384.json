    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This Medieval reliquary is a time capsule of ten centuries and two radically different cultures.  Within the carved crystal mounted in the center, there's a small piece of linen containing the tooth of John the Baptist.  He was the gospel prophet who baptized Jesus Christ.  A crucifix is located at the very top of the reliquary, the spires that rise from the buttresses on either side and the steeply pitched roof of the central chapel are a miniature imitation of the gothic style of church architecture.  The carved crystal began life very differently, it was made in Muslim, Egypt sometime around the end of the first millennium CE.  Although its translucence is ideal for displaying the shrouded tooth within, it was originally intended by its manufacturer to hold perfume.  The object probably made its way to Germany as a result of a bustling Mediterranean trade in the Middle Ages.  Once a secular container made by Muslims to hold an elegant fragrance, it now displays a sacred Christian relic.</p>\n",
