Bonnie Peairs, startled by two boys in costume, called for her husband to get his gun. When Rodney Peairs opened the carport door, Hattori, thinking he had found the party, ran towards him. Frightened, Peairs ordered him to freeze. Hattori barely understood English and did not stop. He was shot and killed. \n\nPeairs was acquitted of manslaughter under a Louisiana law that allows citizens to use deadly force when protecting themselves or their homes from intruders.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
