Amulets were such an important part of Egyptian religious beliefs that they were worn by both the living and the dead. They could be mounted on rings or strung as bracelets or necklaces and were placed among the mummy wrappings to secure the deceased\u2019s rebirth and well-being in the afterlife. There are many varieties of amulets, including figures of deities, parts of the human (or divine) body, animals, plants, and objects of daily life. The leg and foot were thought to provide the deceased mobility in the afterlife. A few examples of these types of amulets have been found on the ankles of mummies.</p>\n",
