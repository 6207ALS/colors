Monet was reluctant to visit the city, likely because it had been featured so prominently throughout the history of art and had been treated by mentors, colleagues, and friends such as J. M. W. Turner, James McNeill Whistler, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and John Singer Sargent. At age sixty-eight, however, Monet may have assumed he would not have another opportunity to travel there, so he allowed himself to be convinced by his second wife, Alice, to accept an invitation from Mary Hunter, a British socialite, patron of the arts, and acquaintance of Sargent, who had probably introduced them when Monet was in London in 1900 and 1901 (see cats. 38\u201341). Hunter was staying at the Palazzo Barbaro, a fifteenth-century palace situated on the Grand Canal. Purchased by the wealthy American couple Ariana and Daniel Curtis in 1885, it became a gathering place for writers, musicians, and artists like Sargent, who in 1899 painted a portrait of the Curtis family in the salon of the palazzo; its architecture also served as the inspiration for the museum that Isabella Stewart Gardner built in Boston in 1903. In mid-September 1908 Hunter had arranged to stay there while Mrs. Curtis was attending to the estate of her husband. The Monets lodged there for two weeks before moving to the posh H\u00f4tel Britannia, one of the most expensive hotels in the city.\n\nThe two-month trip transformed Monet\u2019s opinion of Venice and galvanized his desire to paint the city. He began thirty-seven paintings, including the Art Institute\u2019s Venice, Palazzo Dario, and even hoped to continue his work on another trip. He wrote his friend, the art critic Gustave Geffroy on the final day of his stay, of his planned return: \u201cWell! [My enthusiasm for Venice] has done nothing but grow, and the moment has now come to leave this unique light. I grow very sad. It is so beautiful, but one has to see reason: many factors force us to return home. The only consolation I have is the thought of coming back here next year, for I have been able to do nothing but sketches, beginnings. But what a dreadful shame that I did not come here when I was young and would dare anything! Anyway . . . I have spent some delightful moments here and nearly forgot that I am the old man that I am!\u201d\n\nMonet\u2019s profound change of attitude toward the city can be tracked through Alice\u2019s letters to her daughter Germaine Salerou, in which she recorded their activities on a near-daily basis. Upon their arrival, Monet declared the city \u201ctoo beautiful to be painted,\u201d she recounted; he would not even take out his brushes because the environment was \u201cnot renderable.\u201d By October 19, however, Alice relayed that Monet had finally decided to paint; shortly after that, the artist was already writing to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, that he was looking forward to returning to Venice the following year to continue serious work on his chosen motifs.\n\nIn her letters Alice also chronicled the struggles that plagued Monet throughout the Venice trip, including fluctuating weather conditions that frustrated him, as well as moments of self-doubt. Nonetheless, the Venice sojourn proved to be productive for the artist. He set up a regimented work schedule, painting between 7:45 and 8:00 in the morning until mid- to late-afternoon. Their visit also lasted much longer than they had anticipated, as evidenced by the Art Institute\u2019s canvas. Monet had to supplement the stock of supplies he had shipped from home, presumably because he was painting more than he had originally intended. Palazzo Dario was painted on a canvas Monet purchased from Venetian art supplier Emilio Aickelin (see Technical Report/Manufacturer\u2019s/supplier\u2019s marks). The artist also acquired from Aickelin the sketchbook in which his only known drawing from Venice appears (fig. 45.1 [D404r]).\n\nThe Venice suite was not a formal exercise in reproducing near-identical subject matter subtly altered to reflect differences in season or lighting, as exemplified in Stacks of Wheat (see cats. 28\u201332), which he had executed over fifteen years earlier. Referring to his paintings of Venice, Monet himself observed that \u201cthere was not a series among the views, just different motifs repeated one, two, or three times.\u201d The works from this trip can be organized into ten subgroups, with subjects including the Grand Canal (fig. 45.2 [W1738]), the Palazzo Ducale (fig. 45.3 [W1743]), the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore (fig. 45.4 [W1749]), and the Rio de la Salute (fig. 45.5 [1763]), painted from varying viewpoints. The Art Institute\u2019s Venice, Palazzo Dario fits into a subgroup of frontally viewed palaces located on the Grand Canal; in addition to the Palazzo Dario, the subjects included the Palazzo da Mula (fig. 45.6 [W1764]) and the Palazzo Contarini (fig. 45.7 [W1767]). All the sites Monet selected were easily accessible from his lodgings, and it is no surprise that every picture from this trip involves the depiction of water, a standard element in conventional treatments of Venice as well as a recurring interest in Monet\u2019s oeuvre.\n\nMonet\u2019s effort to represent Venice, a city that seemed to float on water, is particularly striking in his paintings of palaces like Venice, Palazzo Dario. His decision to dedicate most of the bottom half of his palazzo paintings to the canal forced him to cut off the upper floors of the structures as well as the sky, which is only visible, if at all, as slivers between buildings down the narrow openings of the waterway. Octave Mirbeau\u2019s preface to the 1912 catalogue that accompanied the first exhibition of these paintings celebrates the interplay of the light off the buildings and the waters of the canal: \u201cThe reflections pile up. One would say that the water and light gain support and strength on the fa\u00e7ades . . . The reflection of the palaces is warm in the dense water. When the sun is high the atmosphere applies itself and sumptuously gives body to the vertical surface of the walls and the horizontal surface of the water; it is mixed with the color as though it had passed through the rose of a stained-glass window.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mirbeau\u2019s poetic commentary suggests that the juxtaposition of the palaces and the canal waters is complementary, a tension undeniably exists in these palazzo pictures: the water and the architecture compete for space on the canvas. This is amplified by Monet\u2019s experimentation with the formats of the works: the depictions of the Palazzo Dario and the Palazzo Contarini (see fig. 45.7) are the only ones that employ both vertically and horizontally oriented canvases. In their first exhibition at Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris in 1912 (fig. 45.8 [W1758]) and fig. 45.9 [W1759]), the Art Institute\u2019s horizontal Venice, Palazzo Dario was exhibited alongside the two vertically oriented works of the same subject. His compositional choices were also consistent throughout his working process\u2014the one extant sketch Monet made of the Palazzo Dario features the same crowded composition, despite the fact that he had more room to expand the image on the page of the sketchbook (fig. 45.1, bottom).\n\nThe art historian Paul Tucker has suggested that Monet mystifies the elaborately designed and ornately decorated structures in the palazzo pictures, the solid, marble fa\u00e7ades of which seem to nearly float above the canal\u2019s waters. Tucker has also proposed that in his paintings of Venice more generally, Monet was engaging with modernist concerns. Fighting against the picturesque and clich\u00e9 views by amateur artists of Venice that had proliferated with increased tourism to the city, Tucker suggests that Monet was trying to reinstate art historical weight to its motifs. By turning hackneyed subjects into studies of abstract geometry and flattened planes, Monet was attempting to reinvigorate the treatment of the city that had been so important to the history of art.\n\nMonet\u2019s unique viewpoint was certainly the result of his calculated selection of the locations from which he painted. Wildenstein suggests that Monet set up his easel on the opposite bank of the Grand Canal, slightly to the east of the Palazzo Corner della Ca\u2019 Grande (the prefecture). But Monet\u2019s unusual, and rather low, viewpoint was likely also due to the fact that he was working in a gondola. Notably, in a letter to her daughter dated November 9, 1908, Alice recorded that although that particular day had been foggy, wet, and cold, Monet\u2014under the shelter of a covered gondola\u2014was able to paint one of the palaces. It may have been the frame of the gondola cabin\u2019s window that informed the way in which Monet composed his palazzo paintings.\n\nThe gondola was a recurrent theme in Alice\u2019s correspondence home. As the art historian Stephen Eisenman has noted, \u201cAlice was prone to additional dark reflections during the couple\u2019s weeks in Venice. She compared their canopied, black gondola\u2014Monet\u2019s floating studio\u2014to a catafalque, and brooded about being separated from the tomb of her long-dead daughter [Suzanne Hosched\u00e9 Butler].\u201d But more often, Alice wrote about how much she enjoyed the couple\u2019s enchanting gondola rides, which they took for both pleasure and work. She raved about the incredible skies they would see during their leisurely sunset boat trips, but also, in recounting their rigid daily routine, Alice told her daughter that she regularly accompanied Monet in the gondola while he worked, an activity that required her to remain extremely still.\n\nMonet told the Bernheim-Jeune brothers that he would personally like to keep one of the Palazzo Dario series as a souvenir of \u201csuch happy days passed with my dear Alice.\u201d One wonders whether Monet was specifically reminiscing about the gondolas, for they were indeed critical components of Monet\u2019s paintings, particularly Venice, Palazzo Dario. All depictions of the structure include one large gondola at center, which\u2014because the building itself is always slightly off center\u2014becomes the grounding force in the disorientingly cropped scenes.\n\nBut while the gondola is an anchor in the Art Institute\u2019s painting, it is also one of the components that may have changed significantly. Most, if not all, of the works begun in Venice required significant reworking back in his Giverny studio. These revisions certainly involved the aid of memory, imagination, and even fabrication, since they were not completed until years later, just before the 1912 exhibition, an interruption primarily due to the illness and death of Alice in 1911. Venice, Palazzo Dario indeed reveals evidence of Monet\u2019s multiple sessions: a trace of an earlier signature and date underneath his final one suggests that he had considered the work finished in a previous session but then went back in, made adjustments, and signed it again (fig. 45.10). It is also possible that Monet moved the original placement of the gondola or potentially included more than one in an earlier stage (see Technical Report). Transmitted-infrared imaging reveals a form at center right that looks like a partial gondola gliding in or out of the picture plane (fig. 45.11), similar to the one that Monet added at left in his sketch of the motif (fig. 45.1, bottom).\n\nIt is also notable that the three Palazzo Dario pictures that were included in the 1912 exhibition are the only paintings from the campaign in which Monet included a felze, a closed cabin in the center of the boat. It does not appear in a fourth, much sketchier version of the subject (fig. 45.12 [W1760]). This picture was not included in the 1912 exhibition and may, in fact, be more representative of what the exhibited works looked like in their earlier stages. It is difficult to see from the technical images of the Art Institute\u2019s Venice, Palazzo Dario exactly how Monet laid in the gondola. Close inspection of the surface suggests that the lower edge of the building was painted in before the cabin was added to these compositions (fig. 45.13). Alice sent a postcard of a covered gondola to her granddaughter Alice Butler (fig. 45.14), and it is tempting to suggest that Monet included the cabins as a tribute to Alice, his devoted companion who had accompanied him on his boat trips down the canals.\n\nMonet did not return to Venice as he had hoped, and the exhibition of his Venice works was delayed until 1912, but they were a market success when they finally were presented to the public. Many of the paintings included in the Bernheim-Jeune show, including the Art Institute\u2019s Venice, Palazzo Dario, sold quickly, suggesting the approachability of the series to collectors. One of the versions of Palazzo Dario appears in a 1912 portrait of Josse and Gaston Bernheim-Jeune by \u00c9douard Vuillard (fig. 45.15), a reflection of the significance of Monet\u2019s Palazzo Dario paintings to the dealers as well as the esteem in which these works were held more broadly.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section>incorrect section number 13622 <section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Venice, Palazzo Dario was executed on a pre-primed, no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. There is a label from the Venetian supplier Emilio Aickelin on the back of the original stretcher, and this suggests that the stretched canvas was purchased in Venice. The ground is off-white and consists of two layers. The ground has a distinct diagonal, brush-marked texture, which remains visible on the surface of the painting and gives the illusion of a twill-weave canvas. The composition was built up as a whole in a network of superimposed brushstrokes, largely applied wet-in-wet. In localized areas throughout the painting, the artist wiped or scraped into the soft paint layers, exposing underlying colors. Technical imaging reveals a form in front of the building on the right that suggests an object, possibly a gondola, was included at an earlier stage in the painting. Some small adjustments were made to the gondola in the final painting. Other minor changes were made to some of the architectural details.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 45.16).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1908 (lower left corner, in red paint) (fig. 45.17).\n\nUnderneath the final signature and date, there are traces of an earlier signature and date, executed in brown paint (fig. 45.18). The brown paint appears to have been partially wiped or scraped away, as it is very thin and abraded in places (fig. 45.19). Some strokes from the water were applied on top before the final signature and date were applied (fig. 45.20). The first signature appears to have been similar in size and placement to the final one, and the date appears to have been the same, as the contours of the 8 can be discerned under magnification (fig. 45.21).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65.5 \u00d7 80.5 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (81 \u00d7 65 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 33.4V (1.1) \u00d7 33.0H (0.5) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet canvases analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is strong cusping along the top edge, mild, relatively even cusping on the left and right edges, and only faint indications of cusping along the bottom.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1991 treatment. Copper tacks spaced 2.5\u20135 cm apart. There is a series of smaller holes, spaced approximately 3\u20135 cm apart, which probably relates to the aluminum strip molding applied in 1959. The top edge was restretched in 2002 to deal with some deformations in the canvas (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 3\u20136 cm apart. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the old tack holes on the left, right, and bottom edges, but not along the top edge. Additional tacks were probably subsequently added to reinforce areas of weak attachment where the original holes were degraded.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Dates to 1991 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). It is a five-membered (with vertical crossbar), keyable stretcher with mortise and tenon joints.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. It was described in an undated report as a four-membered, Buck type 2 stretcher with keyable mortise and tenon joints. This report gives the following dimensions: overall, 66 \u00d7 81 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; width, 5 cm; inside depth, 2 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 5 cm.\n\nA supplier\u2019s label from the back of the pre-1974-treatment stretcher (discarded) is preserved in the conservation file: EMILIO AICK[ELIN] / Venezia / Via 22 Marzo / ARTICOLI PER BELLE ART[. . .] / Via 22 Marzo 2378-2038 (fig. 45.22).\n\nIn UV light, evidence of a light-blue fluorescence between the canvas and the ground suggests the presence of an organic layer, possibly glue sizing (fig. 45.23).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, suggesting that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. There is strong diagonal brushmarking (lower left to upper right) on the surface of the ground layer, which is visible where the ground is exposed at the edges of the painting (fig. 45.24) and also in the X-ray (fig. 45.25). The diagonal brushstrokes appear to continue over the tacking margins to the cut edges of the canvas (fig. 45.26). The width of the sweeping brushstrokes suggests that a fairly broad brush was used. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of two layers. The lower layer ranges from approximately 10 to 45 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from approximately 20 to 55 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 45.27, fig. 45.28).\n\nColor\n\nOff-white, with some dark and possibly red particles visible under magnification (fig. 45.29).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains lead white with minor amounts of zinc white and barium sulfate and traces of silica, silicates, and calcium carbonate. The upper layer contains lead white with traces of barium sulfate, iron oxide, calcium-based white, silica, and silicates.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscope examination.\n\nAlthough the ground layer is almost completely obscured by the relatively thick and continuous buildup of paint layers, the pronounced diagonal, brush-marked texture of its surface remains visible throughout the painting, almost giving the appearance of a twill-weave canvas. The ground texture is most noticeable where the paint is thin or lightly dragged across the surface, often at the borders of compositional elements, for example, around the doors and windows (fig. 45.30, fig. 45.31, fig. 45.32). At the same time, the plain-weave texture of the canvas is also visible on the paint surface in some areas. The buildup of the paint, where it was applied in a horizontal direction and with a light touch, often emphasizes the vertical canvas threads, creating a corrugated texture (fig. 45.33).\n\nThe painting appears to have been worked up from a thin lay-in of the composition. Where the earliest layers are visible, the artist seems to have mapped out the composition with more subdued tones, applied in thin layers. In the water, for example, transparent strokes of thinly applied green and greenish-blue paint were laid in first. The water was then built up with individual strokes of different colors, often applied wet-on-wet with little physical mixing or blending of the colors on the canvas (fig. 45.34). Some of the final strokes applied in the water consist of more intense color, lightly dragged across the surface (fig. 45.35). Although the painting is densely built up, the surface is relatively flat, with only low-relief texture, which often comes from beneath the surface from the ground and canvas textures and the crisp brushmarks of underlying layers. There is no impasto and only a few thick, textural strokes scattered over the surface. Both the positive and negative spaces of the architecture were built up to the same degree and sit basically on the same plane (fig. 45.36, fig. 45.37). Throughout the painting, it appears that the artist wiped or scraped into the upper paint layers in localized areas, revealing underlying colors (fig. 45.38, fig. 45.39, fig. 45.40) as well as the ground and canvas in places (fig. 45.19). This was perhaps done as a way of breaking up more solid areas of color, and it also contributes to the flattened appearance of the paint surface. It is difficult to say how the scraping or wiping was carried out, as no actual tool marks are evident, but it appears to have been done when the upper layers were still soft (fig. 45.41) and sometimes offers a cross-sectional view of superimposed paint layers in small areas (fig. 45.42).\n\nUnderlying brushwork at the base of the building on the right, visible in transmitted infrared, suggests that the artist made changes in this area (fig. 45.43). The curved brushstrokes are suggestive of a gondola but could also be related to adjustments made to the building where it meets the water. The paint applied on top is slightly more solid and opaque than the more open brushwork of the rest of the water (fig. 45.44). If the earlier brushwork did represent a boat, it is difficult to say whether both boats were present simultaneously in the composition at any stage. The central boat does, however, appear to have been part of the composition from early on, based on its relative radio-transparency in the X-ray (fig. 45.45), which shows that the water and the features of the palazzo behind were built up around it. It appears that the boat in the final painting was extended on the left side where it continues on top of the building. Other minor changes involve the door and window of the building on the left, both of which were moved further to the right (fig. 45.46). Similarly, the small, circular feature on the left side of the lower level of Palazzo Dario was shifted slightly to the lower left (fig. 45.47). The architectural features of the building on the right appear to have been laid in much more distinctly compared to their final appearance. This is apparent in the X-ray, in which strong, directional, lead white\u2013rich strokes delineating the different stories and window openings of the building are clearly visible. In the final painting, these features have been largely subdued by the thin, sketchy brushwork on the surface (fig. 45.48). The thicker, more textured underlayers were dry when the upper layers were applied; the crisp ridges of those earlier brushstrokes remained undisturbed when subsequent paint layers were applied and when localized areas were subjected to the scraping/wiping technique discussed above (fig. 45.49). This supports the idea that the painting was carried out in more than one session.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Possible scraping of paint layers may have involved the use of a palette knife, but no tool marks could be discerned. Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, strontium yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, malachite, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, cobalt violet, and possibly zinc white.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe synthetic varnish that was applied in the 1974 treatment was thinned in 1991 (see ). Since the treatment report states that this coating was \u201cthinned,\u201d it is likely that some synthetic varnish residues remain on the surface (see Conservation History). The paint surface has a soft sheen in areas where the paint is thicker and smooth, and it appears more matte where the paint is thinly applied and the canvas texture is visible. According to a 1959 examination report, the painting was unvarnished at that time.\n\nIn 1959, the painting (described as unvarnished at the time) was surface cleaned, and a spray coat of equal parts methacrylate L44 and L46 was applied. The painting was backed with a resin-coated hardboard and aluminum strip molding was attached to the edges.\n\nIn 1974, discolored surface films were removed. The painting was wax-resin lined and restretched on an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 1991, the synthetic resin coating was reduced. The wax-resin lining was removed. Weak areas of the tacking margins were reinforced, and a small puncture in the center of the canvas was reinforced and filled. The tacking margins were strip lined. The painting was restretched on a new stretcher with a loose lining. The painting was keyed out, and the keys were secured. A Fome-Cor backing board was applied.\n\nIn 2002, the painting was restretched on the top edge to ameliorate ripples in the canvas, and the stretcher was keyed out. Wedge retainers were added to keep the keys in place.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas has a loose lining, and the tacking edges are strip lined (the 1974 wax-resin lining was removed in 1991). The canvas is fairly taut on the stretcher and there are no planar deformations. The tacking margins are deteriorated and torn at the old tack holes and the corners. In general, the ground layer is moderately abraded and dirty along the edges. The paint layer is stable. There are a few, tiny flake losses: at lower right in the water; to the left of the door of the Palazzo Dario (documented as a small puncture in the 1991 treatment report); above the upper arched windows of the left building; and a vertical series at the upper right edge, which may be the result of a scratch or impact. There is a light scratch, made when the paint was still soft, near the center of the large area of sky. There is only very light cracking scattered throughout the paint surface, mainly spanning thicker strokes of paint. The painting is unvarnished and has a subtle, variable surface sheen depending on the qualities of the paint and the brushwork. There are residues of starch paste and wax-resin adhesive from the 1974 lining procedure in the recesses of the paint texture throughout the surface. There are some old retouching residues around the edges of the painting.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1991): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame with a running acanthus-leaf ornament with acanthus-leaf miters and a ribbon and cove sight (APF Inc., New York, 1991). The frame is water gilded over red-brown bole on gesso. The hollow is burnished, with selective burnishing on the carved ornament. The gold has been heavily rubbed overall and toned with thin oil paint washes, casein washes, and dark flecking. The carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is cove; scotia, convex face with a running acanthus-leaf ornament with acanthus-leaf miters on a recut bed; fillet; hollow; fillet; torus with a ribbon ornament; and cove (fig. 45.50).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed 1991): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, L-shaped, narrow frame with a gilded face on a mahogany molding with exposed splines at the miters. The frame may be a design by James L. Speyer (fig. 45.51).\n\nPrevious frame (installed before 1922; date removed, unknown) The work was previously housed in what was probably the original frame, a French (Parisian), early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches with cabochon centers on a quadrillage bed, leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding, and a independent fillet liner (fig. 45.52).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist, in half-shares, to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, and Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 10, 1912, for 10,000 francs.\n\nSold to Durand-Ruel, New York, Oct. 11, 1912, or Oct. 17, 1912.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Arthur B.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the signature contains lead white, vermilion, and red lake; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Venice\\_33\\_446\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d June 15, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_446\\_Monet\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d May 22, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the measured dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching of the painting on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Venice, Palazzo Dario, 1908(W1757/1933.446)\u201d, May 2011. The canvas is very fine and has the highest thread count of all the Monet paintings in the Art Institute collection.\n\nThe stronger cusping along the top edge probably represents primary cusping, related to the attachment of the larger canvas (from which this canvas was cut) to the commercial priming frame, while the milder cusping on the other sides is probably secondary cusping, caused when the canvas was mounted on the painting\u2019s original stretcher (see Ground Application).\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nJohn House notes that Monet\u2019s Venetian sketchbook (1908; Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, inv. no 5135) also has an Aickelin label; see House, Monet: Nature Into Art, (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 230. The label is reproduced in James A. Ganz and Richard Kendall, The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings (Williamstown, Mass.: Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute/Yale University Press, 2007), p. 165, fig. 142, and appears to be identical to the label from the stretcher of this painting.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. Paint scraping samples taken in 1974 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_446\\_Monet\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d May 22, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_446\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 13, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Venice\\_33\\_446\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d June 15, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIf two boats did coexist at some stage, it is possible that, for compositional reasons, the central gondola was lengthened after the other gondola was painted out.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: strontium yellow, vermilion, malachite (PLM, XRF, Raman spectroscopy); lead white, cadmium yellow, viridian, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); red lake (PLM). XRF analysis detected cobalt and arsenic in areas of purple paint, indicating that the cobalt violet is a cobalt arsenate. Zinc was detected in trace to moderate amounts in all areas of the painting analyzed by XRF; further analysis would be required to identify the source of the zinc. Paint scraping samples taken in 1974 were reexamined by PLM in 2014. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_446\\_Monet\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d May 22, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_446\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 13, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Venice\\_33\\_446\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d June 15, 2011; Federica Pozzi, \u201cRaman spectroscopy results,\u201d Mar. 7, 2013; Federica Pozzi, \u201cRaman spectroscopy results,\u201d June 16, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
