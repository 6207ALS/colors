    "description": "<p>This chasuble's motif, the pomegranate, was the predominate textile motif, along with related forms such as pomegranate thistles and pineapples, during the 15th century. Church specification dictated that all chasubles had to be made of silk, the most expensive and most precious of all materials. Quite frequently gold and silver threads were used to embellish the back of the chasuble as seen in this example. The Orphrey band, which was added at a later time, depict the Madonna and child, St. Peter, and an unidentified saint, who was probably a local patron.</p>\n",
