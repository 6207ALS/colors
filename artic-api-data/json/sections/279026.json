The interior subjects he typically selected were intimate domestic scenes; here, however, he has chosen to depict the bustling atmosphere of a light-filled dining room. The lithograph has the appearance of a free and spontaneous sketch. T. R. Way, who may have frequented this establishment not far from the Way offices, supplied the following description in his catalogue entry (1896, 1905): \u201cA slight interior of the restaurant in the Strand, with windows on the right, and on the left a large looking-glass in a panel of the wall, with reflections; in front, some seated figures.\u201d\n\nThis drawing was one of five (cat. 34, cat. 35, cat. 36, cat. 37, and cat. 38) transferred and proved in October 1890 (app. II.3 and app. II.4). The effect of the fine-grained transfer paper varies considerably from impression to impression. Those printed on the smoothest wove papers reproduce the grain clearly, while an impression in The Art Institute of Chicago (illustrated here) on a textured laid paper gives the appearance of having been drawn directly on stone.\n\nImpressions of Gatti\u2019s are rare, although not quite as scarce as Way\u2019s 1905 catalogue suggests. His count of four impressions should be at least doubled. Bearing in mind the fact that Whistler\u2019s correspondence with his printers between November 1887 and December 1891 has been lost, in the remaining body of letters there are no orders for impressions of the lithograph, and there were no examples in the artist\u2019s estate when he died. It thus seems possible that the image was removed from the stone shortly after the small group of early impressions had been pulled.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (367 \u00d7 240 mm), signed; MWC, cream Japanese paper (318 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; SC, grayish ivory chine (205 \u00d7 167 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (379 \u00d7 280 mm). Glasgow: HAG, grayish ivory chine (204 \u00d7 165 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (457 \u00d7 317 mm). London: BM, grayish ivory chine (204 \u00d7 166 mm) mounted on white plate paper (341 \u00d7 266 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Gatti\u2019s Concert Room. Washington: FGA, cream Japanese paper (316 \u00d7 200 mm); NGA, cream wove paper (317 \u00d7 200 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Another mounted impression is found in New York, MMA.  \nNesta R.
