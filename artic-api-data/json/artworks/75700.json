Continuing work begun by his father, who designed coordinated interiors for Oak Hill in 1800, Field McIntire enhanced the home with further decorations. He followed his father\u2019s style, carving ornament\u2014including grape vines, cornucopia, and baskets of fruit and flowers\u2014as well as architectural details, such as dentil molding and the Greek key motif, that bespeak reserved Federal design in America.</p>\n",
