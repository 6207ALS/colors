The very first form of music that I can remember experiencing was the sound of my dad singing native chants to coo me to sleep as a baby. I grew up around powwows and the songs my grandfather and grandmother sang with my family in their drum group. This is what shapes how I create music: with passion and from the heart.</em></p><p>Black Belt Eagle Scout\u2019s debut album, <em>Mother of My Children</em>, provides a snapshot of loss and landscape from the perspective of Katherine Paul, a radical Indigenous queer feminist. The record was named<em> \"</em>Best Rock Album of 2018\"<em> </em>by <em>Pitchfork</em>, with Katherine being heralded as a favorite new musician by NPR Music, <em>Stereogum</em>, and <em>Paste</em>. Released in 2018, the album <em>At the Party With My Brown Friends</em> finds its power in love, desire, and friendship. The squalling guitar anthems that shaped its predecessor are replaced by delicate vocals and soft keys, sentiments spoken and unspoken, presenting something shadowy and unsettling; a stirring of the waters. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYIC6WNweKg \" target=\"_blank\">Watch the video for <em>Run To Ya</em> here.</a></p><p>This virtual event will be hosted on Zoom.
