Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, and then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as seen in this fourth-state impression. After satisfactorily arriving at a final composition on the block, the artist focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color using more customary oil-based media, as well as some that contain beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 51.3.2).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 51.3.3).\n\nFour different layers of media are present in this impression of Noa Noa (Fragrant). Chrome yellow ink was applied first by transfer from another source, traditionally called a tone block, but instead it is likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass in this instance. The printing ink in this layer has a rather fluid appearance and was applied to localized areas on the block. The second layer of oil-based media combines traces of emerald green (est.), chrome yellow, and orange (a mixture of chrome yellow and vermilion) (see fig. 51.3.4). It was applied to specific areas directly on the paper by means of transfer from a piece of glass. However, this layer of medium has a thick, caked appearance indicative of the wax and resin it contains. Atop these two layers of colored media, the block was printed in black ink that is a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue (trace amounts of vermilion are also present, likely from the red medium underlying the black ink in the area analyzed) (fig. 51.3.5). Gauguin completed the print with final touches of reddish-brown watercolor and black ink that he applied sparingly with a dry brush.\n\nThe paper is a good-quality, medium-weight Japanese paper that has a uniform distribution of long paper fibers that are visible under magnification. The sheet was mounted onto a secondary support, and the edges are all irregularly cut with a sharp edge rather than hand torn. The trimming of the sheet extends into the printed image quite significantly, especially in the lower left corner. The opacity of the thick secondary support makes it impossible to glean any information in transmitted light; however, the fibrous quality of the paper is enhanced when the sheet is viewed in transmitted light.\n\nThe impression is laid down on a piece of sturdy cream wove card. The artist mounted the print onto a heavier support for presentation purposes. However, at some point the mount was cut down well into the image area so that it is no longer visible from the front. Careful examination of the delaminated edges confirms that the card is of a type that Gauguin used to mount a number of his works on paper. The card stock contains numerous blue fibers that are dispersed throughout. Mounts of this type are extant on a number of prints from Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite (see fig. 51.3.1).\n\n358 \u00d7 205 mm (max.) (image/primary/secondary support)\n\nThis impression of Noa Noa evolved through a series of four stages. The media were applied in several layers. The various contours of their surfaces were fully assessed by means of surface shape studies undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often elude detection in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image of the topography of the paper that reveals the manner in which the various media sit on the surface of the paper (see fig. 51.3.3). The bottom layer of chrome yellow media was applied overall by means of transfer from another source, traditionally called a tone block, to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper or another wood block; however, it is more likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. The medium appears to have been applied in a very fluid consistency. Its even appearance and uniform dispersion onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. However, there are several areas where the tone of the Japanese paper remains visible and devoid of the chrome yellow that covers much of the sheet. These areas include the NOANOA medallion at the top, the distant background where the hut is located, and the figures\u2019 bodies. Since the artist wiped media from selected areas to ensure that the yellow medium was placed where intended, it is likely that a piece of glass was used so that he could see where he wished to remove the yellow ink. To achieve this degree of specificity, it is likely that Gauguin brushed the ink onto the glass. By placing the glass over the block, Gauguin could accurately locate and remove the yellow ink from the areas in which he did not want it to appear.\n\nAfter the sheet of glass, acting as a tone block, was printed, a second layer of media was applied to the glass. Microscopic examination indicates that residual yellow ink that did not transfer to the paper remained on the glass and a second layer was applied directly on top of it in a second transfer. In this second layer of media, a golden yellow and orange predominate, with lesser amounts of green present as well (fig. 51.3.6). The predominant medium here has a crusty, lichen-like appearance that differs greatly from the fluid yellow-ink layer below (fig. 51.3.7). The dimensionality of the medium is more pronounced in raking light. Examination under magnification and gentle probing with a needle reveals that the medium has a waxy consistency, and, indeed, the oil-based medium was found to contain some beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin). The dimensional, thick, and cakey oil-based media appear as rounded islands that sit on top of the paper. The high points have been rubbed flat and exhibit sheen. In raking light, the edges of the islands of media reflect light and shimmer. There is an obvious vertical directionality to the transferred medium, indicative of rubbing in a vertical direction. It is clear that the media was burnished under pressure.\n\nIt is possible that Gauguin took advantage of the properties of the wax-and-resin-containing medium by applying it to the glass and then allowing it to cool and partially harden before transferring it to paper. When Gauguin placed the sheet of paper that now carried the yellow tone back on top of the glass and rubbed it, he transferred seemingly random islands of encrusted media throughout the sheet. However, close examination reveals that there is a denser application of the medium in the upper half of the sheet, especially along the left and right sides. Color variations likewise initially seem random, yet there is a greater concentration of green in the lower part of the tree and a greater concentration of orange in the skirt of the foreground figure. The general absence of this medium from the uppermost medallion and the upper half of the torso of the foreground figure are clearly specific exclusions and provide further evidence that glass was used, not only as the support to carry the media but as a means to accurately locate it.\n\nHaving applied the second layer of media, Gauguin proceeded to position the paper on top of the wood block that he had inked in black. Here, as in many of his impressions, the black ink was unevenly applied to the roller as evidenced by darker black vertical striations to the left, center, and right of the composition. Because the artist applied only light pressure using a hard roller, the black ink transferred primarily to the high points of the dimensional islands of colored media, so that the yellow base tone remained visible around them (fig. 51.3.8). The end result is a reticulated surface where halos of color appear around each isolated island of black.\n\nIn a fourth and final step, Gauguin returned to the print after it had dried and hand colored selected passages. Using reddish-brown watercolor he darkened the face, proper left shoulder, arm, and legs of the figure in the background. He used the same tone, applied with a dry brush, to darken the face, proper right arm, and a band of the skirt of the figure in the foreground while using black to selectively darken the legs (fig. 51.3.9). Ultimately, Gauguin worked in a deliberate manner to lay out zones of color, yet he left the visual end result of the mechanical transfer of media to chance. The artist\u2019s approach was systematic; his materials and their application were well thought-out to achieve the desired tonal and textural variations evident in the work. What at first glance appears to be a spontaneously executed production is instead a well-considered methodology borne of an assessment of the materials, their diverse mechanical properties, and their distinctive appearance when transferred onto a paper surface.\n\nIn 1988 the print was treated locally to make small repairs along the edges using Japanese paper and wheat starch paste.\n\nThe print is in very good condition. It is irregularly shaped, with the lower left corner trimmed at an angle. Small fragments of the primary support extend past the secondary support and are very vulnerable to damage or loss. There is a diagonal incised line 8 cm long in the immediate foreground just above the bottom edge to the left. There is a clear, shiny accretion located 14 cm in from the right edge and 3 cm up from the bottom edge. Some foxing is visible in the primary support but is very much obscured by the yellow media in the print. It is readily visible under ultraviolet light. A collector\u2019s stamp appears as a circular dent located 3 cm in from the right edge and 7 cm up from the bottom edge below the dog\u2019s tail. The mount is foxed throughout. Under ultraviolet light the foxing appears as rounded, dark golden-yellow stains, and residual adhesives and papers fluoresce bright white.  \nHarriet K.

The pigments in the printing inks and oil-based media were identified by XRF, Raman microspectroscopy, macro-XRF, and FTIR.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua (The God) are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon. To return to the original view, click on the return icon (semicircle with arrow).\n\nThis method of transfer is clearly the precursor to the watercolor and oil-transfer methods that Gauguin adopted moving forward (see Tahitian Landscape [cat. 68] and Nativity [Mother and Child Surrounded by Five Figures] for examples).

Emerald green was identified in all of them. Visual examination of this example from the suite reveals that emerald green is present. The tonality of the green medium and its appearance on the paper is the same as those for which pigment analysis was conducted.

In this impression, because the bright-yellow medium appears to be of a thin, fluid consistency, it could not have been transferred from a paper carrier. The paper itself would have absorbed much more media than would have deposited in the transfer process, and the resulting transfer could not have been as distinct and media rich.\n\nAnalysis of the organic media using THM-Py-GCMS found it to be an oil-based medium with beeswax and Pinaceae resin present in different amounts in various prints.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

This print is inscribed with the number 3, the third print in the \u201cGravures sur bois\u201d section of the exhibition, which corresponds to entry no. 138, \u201cNoa-Noa.\u201d\n\nThere are two editions of this exhibition catalogue.
