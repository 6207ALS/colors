    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Take moment to explore this intricate and beautiful computer called an astrolabe.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The various moving parts allow you to determine your exact position and the hour. These calculations were most useful when traveling at sea or across the desert. The inscription at the top of the astrolabe is probably a pious dedication, perhaps a quotation from the Koran. Islamic religious practice, summarized as the five pillars of Islam, requires the faithful to pray five times a day in the direction of Mecca in today\u2019s Saudi Arabia. Using an astrolabe an observant Muslim could determine the correct time and orientation for prayers. Beginning in the eighth century Islamic merchants traveled as far west as Spain, as far north as Sweden and as far East as China. Islamic ships sailed the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Persian Gulf but also plied the Indian Sea, and ventured as far as the sea the Chinese called the Ocean of Great Peace, or the Pacific Ocean.</p>\n",
