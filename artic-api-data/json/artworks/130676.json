A miniaturized scene at the lower left of the base, below the central Buddha\u2019s feet, shows his miraculous birth from his mother\u2019s side. Above this is the Buddha\u2019s descent from heaven, where he went to preach to his dead mother, and farther up, the moment of his enlightenment, with his proper right hand touching the earth to witness. The upper left scene depicts his first sermon at the Deer Park in Sarnath.<br>On the right side are scenes representing the miracles that the Buddha performed at Shravasti, including the gift of honey from a monkey\u2014shown in miniature at the lower right corner of the platform near his gift-giving hand\u2014and the Buddha\u2019s taming of a wild elephant, by his left foot. The scene of the <em>parinirvana</em> tops the stele: the Buddha\u2019s life flame is extinguished as he reaches <em>nirvana</em>.</p>\n",
