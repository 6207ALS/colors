    "description": "Paul C\u00e9zanne, Georges Seurat, Paul Gauguin, Vincent van Gogh, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others began as Impressionists but soon extended their explorations of the world around them to create highly personal work. With their foundations in the bright colors of Impressionism and the break from traditional representational art, the Post-Impressionists worked alone but collectively created the bridge into the expressionism of the 20th Century. Their delightful and evocative masterpieces are celebrated in this gorgeous new book.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10.98 x 1 x 11.38 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 192</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 150</li></ul>",
