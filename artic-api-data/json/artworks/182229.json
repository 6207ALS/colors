    "description": "<p>Gourd-shaped bottles like this one demonstrate a sensitive approach to form, proportion, and decoration. Writing in the 1950s, Margaret Trowell stated that such works were made in Uganda among several related cultures, but were the specialty of the Nyoro, Toro, and Ganda.  This footed bottle was decorated by hand with carefully etched meandering lines.  The use of gourd bottles, well documented in the region, undoubtedly inspired the creation of ceramic examples like these. Trowell describes the Nyoro as particularly focused on the aesthetic quality of the gourds they used as containers, noting that they \u201ctake special pride in the appearance of their gourds, and although they rarely decorate them, rejoice in the most perfectly shaped vessel polished to a rich red-brown.\u201d Both gourds and gourd-shaped ceramic bottles fulfill the same purpose of carrying beer or drinking water. Towel reported that the ceramic versions were true luxury goods, used by the wealthy elite and also made for sale to tourists. [see also 2003.382 and 2003.383].</p>\n",
