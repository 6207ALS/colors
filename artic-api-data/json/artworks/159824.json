    "description": "<p>Felix Gonzalez-Torres\u2019s work is consistently characterized by a sense of quiet elegy. One of the defining moments in his widely influential career, <em>\u201cUntitled\u201d</em> can be considered a self-portrait in the form of words and dates. First realized in 1989, the work expanded with subsequent installations until the artist\u2019s premature death in 1996, and can continue to shift in ongoing manifestations. The portrait joins historical events and enigmatic personal milestones into a running text placed close to the ceiling. Such an installation is reminiscent of traditional friezes carved on the faces of public architecture, including the facade of the Art Institute\u2019s 1893 Allerton Building, which includes artists\u2019 names chiseled into a horizontal band. By offering clues to a personal history in a commemorative form normally dedicated to institutional use, Gonzalez-Torres undercuts the public and official in favor of the private and subjective, reminding us that an individual\u2019s identity is not always reducible to an image captured on canvas or etched in marble. <em>\u201cUntitled\u201d</em> can change each time it is installed and may be presented in an infinite variety of ways. Its owner is obliged to consider adding (or subtracting) events, including ones subsequent to the artist\u2019s death, ensuring that it remains relevant and dynamic.</p>\n",
