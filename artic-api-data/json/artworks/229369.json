    "description": "<p>Brice Marden considers the process of painting to be \u201cabout transformation. Taking that earth, that heavy earthen kind of thing, turning it into air and light.\u201d In the 1980s Marden developed a fluid, calligraphic line that resulted in shimmering, interlaced compositions such as <em>Study for the Muses (Eaglesmere Version)</em>. His paintings slow the spontaneous brushwork of gestural abstraction to an almost meditative pace. Though it is called a \u201cstudy,\u201d Marden worked and reworked this painting across nearly a decade, completing it in his studio in Eagles Mere, Pennsylvania, which he describes as the most \u201cZen-like\u201d of his workspaces. The landscape of Eagles Mere is wet and overgrown with moss and hemlock, features echoed in this painting\u2019s muted palette.<p>\n",
