    "description": "<p>John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), was one of the most sought-after portraitists of his generation on both sides of the Atlantic, creating powerful vibrant likenesses of his sitters. Best known for his portraits, Sargent nevertheless excelled in a variety of genres, including landscapes, watercolors, and murals. This talk explores the artist\u2019s controversial and international career focusing on his relationship with Chicago and his undisputed influence in art history. </p><p>After having lunch on your own, you have several options to fill out your day. You may choose to hear Kathy Cummings discuss <a href=\"/exhibition/georg-jensen-scandinavian-design-living\"><em >Georg Jensen: Scandinavian Design for Living</em></a>. This exhibit is the first major American presentation of Jensen\u2019s silver tableware and products for the home as it traces the changing ideals for modern living in the 20th century. You may also take a guided afternoon gallery tour of the exhibits:  \u2018Sargent and Portraiture\u2019 led by Margaret Farr; and/or \u2018Sargent and Manet\u2019 led by Laura Mueller.
