    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: What follows is a conversation between curator Janice Katz and writer and editor at Teen<br>Vogue, Lucy Diavolo.</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: She is--</p>\n<p>Lucy Diavolo: Wooow. So metal.<br>&amp;lt;laughter&amp;gt;</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: This is \u201cThe Hell Courtesan.\u201d</p>\n<p>Lucy Diavolo: Wow. I\u2019m in love. &amp;lt;laughs&amp;gt;</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: She was actually Buddhist and she would spar with the monk that you see there dancing on<br>the skeleton\u2019s head, about different questions of Buddhist doctrine, and she\u2019s always shown with these<br>really elaborate robes that show all these different scenes in hell. In this case there\u2019s a slight twist as to<br>what\u2019s going on on her robe, because instead of these really scary and off-putting images of hell, you get<br>these really auspicious images of hell. What I mean by that is instead of the red flamelike patterns that<br>you see are made by red coral, which is actually seen as a good luck symbol. But it\u2019s still very, very<br>ghoulish, right? You know, but there she stands at this traditional image of your idealized beauty, but all<br>around her you have something, this surreal, ghoulish scene.</p>\n<p>Lucy Diavolo: Just the look on her face to be so unbothered by the fact that she\u2019s literally dragging hell<br>behind her is very much aspirational--<br>&amp;lt;laughter&amp;gt;</p>\n<p>Lucy Diavolo: --I would say. This is such a fascinating piece to me because of all of this imagery and<br>this sort of hellacious, I guess, symbolism that\u2019s happening here.</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: Yeah. I think the artist is definitely using her to portray a subversive figure, somebody who<br>is a courtesan, somebody who is outside the norms of society, and yet she\u2019s the one who can embrace<br>these Buddhist ideas, understand hell.</p>\n<p>Lucy Diavolo: You know, embracing demonization I think is such a powerful tool for people who find<br>themselves on the margins of society, in finding a way to say, \u201cPeople aren\u2019t going to treat me well. I<br>know that, but it\u2019s going to be because of what they think of me and the notions that they\u2019re going to<br>preconceive of me, so let me play with that, let me live in that space,\u201d and instead of trying to be an angel<br>every day for the rest of my life to prove them wrong, show them that the devil isn\u2019t really that bad. Hell<br>isn\u2019t really something to be dreaded, it\u2019s a place where everything\u2019s possible.</p>\n",
