The poem you're about to hear was written by a YCA poet as response to a work of art in our collection. Please be advised the stuff includes some mature content and may not be appropriate for all listeners.</p>\n<p>Kee Stein: My name is Kee Stein and I'm a former competitor in Chicago's Louder Than A Bomb and an emerging teaching artist.  The title of this piece is &quot;After&quot; in reaction to Cindy Sherman's &quot;Untitled Number 86.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;I consider astral projection, how leaving my body is the most comforting thought I can muster, how I keep trying it, leaving. I casket myself into quiet, unfeeling the time the boys at school called me easy, the time the boys on the curb called me bitch. The world keeps calling me girl, a small mind, a smaller voice gaveled by Congress and 45, whose own small hands are still big enough to touch me and get away with it. But such is manhood, a series of getting away with my body, with my boundaries, with my, no. After they came, I didn't shower. No, I thought it too LMN to cry under a showerhead to hot steam my body into feeling anything but dead.&quot;</p>\n",
