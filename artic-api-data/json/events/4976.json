    "short_description": "<p>On the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, Chicago-based dance company the Seldoms performs <em>Floe</em>, a work focused on climate instability, addressing issues of vanishing polar ice, rising sea levels, extreme weather, forced migration, the tension between denial and evidence, and adaptation and resilience. The performance, by turns irreverent and elegiac, embodies the fragmentation of our global conversation on climate change as it veers from anti-science conspiracy theories to the very real and urgent impacts of global warming.</p><p>The production includes text by Seth Bockley, visual design by Bob Faust, projection by Liviu Pasare, sound design by Mikhail Fiksel, lighting design by Julie E. Ballard, and costume design by Jeff Hancock.</p>",

Under the direction of Carrie Hanson, the company is committed to bringing audiences an expanded experience of dance that ignites thought around real-world issues such as the 2008 recession, climate change, and power in America. With dance at the center, the company\u2019s vision extends to total action and environment and includes collaboration with practitioners in fields including theater, architecture, installation, video, sound, and fashion. </p><p>The Seldoms performs in Chicago and across the US, often at unconventional sites. Past venues include the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, and the Dance Center of Columbia College, along with a truck garage, an Olympic-sized outdoor pool, and Chicago's historic Pulaski Park fieldhouse. </p><p>Their acclaimed dance theater work <em>Power Goes </em>(2015), commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago<em>, </em>was<em> </em>awarded a National Performance Network Creation Fund and a prestigious National Dance Project Production Grant, and has toured to nine US cities. <em>Stupormarket</em>, which examined the 2008 economic crisis, was named \u201cBest of 2011\u201d by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, <em>Chicago Reader</em>, and <em>TimeOut Chicago</em>. In 2015, the Seldoms were the first resident artist at the National Center for Choreography at the University of Akron.</p><p><a href=\"http://theseldoms.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more on the group's website.</a></p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
