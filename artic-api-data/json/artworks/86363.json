    "description": "<p>Bakst traveled to America in 1922, when he was invited to Baltimore by Mr. and Mrs. John Work Garrett to design the conversion of the gymnasium in their home, Evergreen House, to a theater. he made sketches, which were turned into stencils for painted images on the columns and celing of the room. After his return to Paris in April 1923, Bakst was invited by an American named Selig to design textiles for his firm. This American production, to which all four of Allerton's Bakst fabrics belong, is similar in character to the decoration of the Evergreen Theater, shown at right.</p>\n",
