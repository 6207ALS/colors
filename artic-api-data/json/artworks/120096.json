    "description": "<p>Tina Modotti learned photography from her mentor and lover, Edward Weston, with whom she lived in Mexico for several years in the 1920s. During that time, the pair would often photograph together, and produced still lifes, portraits of friends and locals, nudes, and architectural studies notable for their graphic clarity. This photograph of the interior of a church was made on a visit to Tepotzotl\u00e1n during Holy Week in April 1924. In his <em>Daybooks</em>, Weston noted Modotti\u2019s satisfaction with the pictures she made there, especially her \u201cabstraction done in the tower\u201d: \u201cShe is very happy over it and well she may be,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI, myself, would be pleased to have done it.\u201d Modotti heightened the ambiguity of this already abstract composition by printing it with the platinum process, which registers subtle gradations of tone.</p>\n",
