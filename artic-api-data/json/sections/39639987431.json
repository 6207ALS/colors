He used a small piece of coarsely grained wood to carve this image, in contrast to the fine-grained boxwood used for Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) and Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). As in theSuite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105), this piece of wood likely derived from an indigenous source that the artist prepared for carving and printing himself.\n\nThis headpiece was used to adorn two issues of Le sourire; better known is its inclusion in the January 1900 issue (fig. 113.2.2). Gauguin also pasted an impression into a manuscript of Le sourire that he sent to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid in which he combined the text from the November and January issues (fig. 113.2.3). The block is extant, in the collection of the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague (fig. 113.2.4).\n\nThis impression is printed in black ink.\n\nThe thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper presents a delicate laid and chain line pattern. There are small fibrous clumps and inclusions throughout. It is an absorbent Japanese paper that took the ink readily from the block, resulting in a soft, rich impression. The sheet is scissor scut along all edges. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block. The sheets of delicate Japanese paper were printed individually, rather than as a group of two or three on a larger sheet, given their fragility and the skill required to lift them from the wood block.\n\nGauguin adhered an impression of this print to page 186 of his Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, along with impression of At The Black Rocks (cat. 91) and Bust of Nude Womanand Three-Quarter Figure of a Man with a White Cap in Profile, Third Small Figure at Far Right (cat. 121) (fig. 113.2.5). This suggests that these held particular significance for him; in addition, the vertical stacking of three images may well point to the artist\u2019s method of printing blocks consecutively as a group of two or three on larger sheets of Western paper (see Oviri [cat. 84.1, fig. 84.1.3]).\n\n102 \u00d7 151mm (image); 151 \u00d7 229 mm (sheet)\n\nConservation documentation indicates that the sheet was humidified and flattened in September 1984.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. There are small losses in the top corners of the sheet.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K. Stratis\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Robert G.

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nCatherine Maynor, treatment report and photographic documentation, Sept. 1984, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 113.2 Two Women Chattering, headpiece for Le sourire (The Smile), 1900.\n\nfig. 113.2.2 The complete folio of Gauguin\u2019s Le sourire: Journal m\u00e9chant (Jan. 1900) with the headpiece Two Women Chattering.
