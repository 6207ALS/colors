    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This decorative dish was made in France in the 1880's, it represents a fascinating mix or modern and traditional techniques and influences.  Look closely at the finely detailed portrayal of the young woman, her diaphanous scarf frames a face that seems very much of its time, but she is dressed in a Renaissance style costume.  Behind her, the shimmering golden background features a raised floral design inspired by the repeating flora pattern seen on Islamic ceramics.  The dish was made under the direction of the French ceramicist, Th\u00e9odore Deck.  Deck was extremely interested in exploring and experimenting with different ceramic techniques and styles, from Turkish wares to Venetian mosaics and Italian Renaissance pottery.  Then he began inviting contemporary artists to collaborate with him turning their hands to pottery decoration.  One of these was Paul C\u00e9sar Helleu, who would later become famous for his portraits of beautiful society women.  Helleu took images he had made such as this one of the young woman and transferred them onto lithographic plates, the images were then transfer printed onto ceramics.</p>\n",
