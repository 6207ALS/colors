The organization of the plates in the Interactive Wall reflects the order of the exhibition installation. Unless otherwise noted, all works are from the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n1  \nBerenice Abbott (American, 1898\u20131991)  \nExchange Place, New York  \nc. 1934  \nGelatin silver print; 42.2 \u00d7 10.2 cm  \nPeabody Fund, 1951.257  \n\nAll cities are monsters in this sense, yet capable of profound delights. To make the portrait of a city is a life work, and no one portrait suffices because the city is always changing. Everything in the city is properly part of its story\u2014its physical body of brick, stone, steel, glass, wood, its lifeblood of living, breathing men and women. Streets, vistas, panoramas, bird\u2019s-eye views and worm\u2019s-eye views, the noble and the shameful, high life and low life, tragedy, comedy, squalor, wealth, the mighty towers of skyscrapers, the ignoble facades of slums, people at work, people at home, people at play\u2014these are but a small part of the subject matter of the city.  \n\u2014Berenice Abbott, \u201cDocumenting the City,\u201d 1942\n\n2  \nIvan Albright (American, 1897\u20131983)  \nMedical Sketchbook  \n1918  \nWatercolor, graphite, and ink on cream wove paper; 160 \u00d7 260 mm  \nGift of Philip V. Festoso, 1976.439  \n\nI became fascinated with X-ray plates at the front in 1918. Imagine looking right through the human body! It was the best art training I ever had.  \n\u2014Ivan Albright, quoted in \u201cIvan Albright: More Than Meets the Eye,\u201d Art in America, 1977\n\n3  \nIvan Albright (American, 1897\u20131983)  \nHead of Adam Emory Albright (Head of My Father)  \n1935, cast 1952  \nBronze; h. 37.5 cm (14 3/4 in.)  \nMary and Earle Ludgin Collection, 1982.1838  \n\nWe are a weak machine made to do things in a weak way. The body is our tomb. Shake the dust from our soul and maybe there lies the answer for without this planetary body, without eyes the light would not hurt, without flesh the pain would not hurt, without legs our motion might accelerate, without endless restrictions our freedom greater, our slavery less, without examples all around us our originality might be different. Without bodies we might be men.  \n\u2014Ivan Albright, \u201cReflections by the Artist,\u201d 1964\n\n4  \nDesigned by Mariya Mikhailovna Anufrieva (Russian, 1902\u20131988)  \nManufacturer unknown (Russia)  \nSailboats  \n1920s/30s  \nCotton, plain weave; probably roller printed; 6 \u00d7 7 cm (2 3/8 \u00d7 2 3/4 in.)  \nHarriott A.

Furthermore, don\u2019t stop short of the interior: lay bare suppressed girlish thoughts, so that the ground on which they stand is revealed, ideally through the navel, visible as a colorful panorama electrically illuminated deep in the stomach. Should not that be the solution?  \n\u2014Hans Bellmer, \u201cMemories of the Doll Theme,\u201d 1934\n\n7  \nHans Bellmer (German, born Poland, 1902\u20131975)  \nThe Doll (La poup\u00e9e)  \n1936  \nPublished by GLM, Paris  \nBook; 16.7 \u00d7 12.7 \u00d7 .7 cm  \nRyerson and Burnham Libraries\n\n8  \nIlse Bing (American, born Germany, 1899\u20131998)  \nEiffel Tower, Paris  \n1931  \nGelatin silver print; 22.2 \u00d7 28.2 cm (image/paper)  \nJulien Levy Collection, gift of Jean and Julien Levy, 1977.194  \n\nAnd now behold the [Eiffel] Tower, steeple of sound waves. At first its incongruous monstrosity surprised and irritated us. Now, at a thousand feet above the ground, lovers rendezvous there with the birds. . . . The airplane, the elevator, the wheel, which sweep some few human beings up to the kingdom of the birds, have suddenly changed even our natural element. The Tower remains the supreme symbol of modern times.  \n\u2014Florent Fels, introduction to M\u00e9tal by Germaine Krull, 1927\n\n9  \nIlse Bing (American, born Germany, 1899\u20131998)  \nEiffel Tower, Paris  \n1931  \nGelatin silver print; 28.2 \u00d7 22.3 cm  \nJulien Levy Collection, gift of Jean and Julien Levy, 1975.1131\n\n10  \nGeorges Braque (French, 1882\u20131963)  \nStill Life  \n1914  \nCollage composed of charcoal, graphite, oil paint, and watercolor on a variety of cut laid and wove paper elements, laid down on dark tan board; 351 \u00d7 279 mm  \nGiven in memory of Charles Barnett Goodspeed by Mrs. Charles B. Goodspeed, 1947.879  \n\nI did my first \u201cpapiers coll\u00e9s\u201d [pasted papers] . . . before I went off to the war. How did I come by the idea? . . . It\u2019s a sort of revelation.\u201d  \n\u2014Georges Braque, Cahiers d\u2019Art, 1954  \nPicasso and Braque incorporated in some of their pictures letters from labels and other printed matter, because label, notice and advertisement play a very important aesthetic role in the modern city and are well-suited for incorporation into works of art.  \n\u2014Guillaume Apollinaire, \u201cModern Painting,\u201d 1913\n\n11  \nLuis Bu\u00f1uel (Spanish, 1900\u20131983)  \nSalvador Dal\u00ed (Spanish, 1904\u20131989)  \nAn Andalusian Dog (Un chien andalou)   \n1928/29  \n35mm black-and-white film, sound; 16 min.  \nCourtesy Transflux Films and Les Grands Films Classiques  \n\nAlthough the Surrealists didn\u2019t consider themselves terrorists, they were constantly fighting a society they despised. Their principal weapon wasn\u2019t guns, of course; it was scandal. Scandal was a potent agent of revelation . . . The real purpose of Surrealism was not to create a new literary, artistic, or even philosophical movement, but to explode the social order, to transform life itself.  \n\u2014Luis Bu\u00f1uel,My Last Sigh, 1982\n\n12  \nDesigned by Sergi Petrovich Burylin (Russian, 1876\u20131942)  \nManufactured by Ivanovo-Voznesensk Factories (Russia)  \nBelts and Gears  \n1927/32  \nCotton, twill weave; probably screen-printed; 10 \u00d7 18.4 cm (4 \u00d7 7 1/4 in.)  \nHarriott A.

Chapman, 2007.30  \n\nAmong other symptoms, the production of stranger and stranger objects . . . assures us that all around us present-day reality is cracking at the seams. . . . I insist on this primordial truth: one must oneself discover, manipulate, tame, and construct irrational objects to be able to appreciate the particular or general value of those displayed here.  \n\u2014Claude Cahun, \u201cBeware Domestic Objects!,\u201d 1936\n\n18  \nAlvin Langdon Coburn (English, born United States, 1882\u20131966)  \nVortograph  \n1917  \nGelatin silver print; 22.1 \u00d7 27 cm  \nHarold L. Stuart Endowment, 1987.379  \n\nWhy should not the camera also throw off the shackles of conventional representation and attempt something fresh and untried? Why should not its subtle rapidity be utilized to study movement? Why not repeated successive exposures of an object in motion on the same plate? Why should not perspective be studied from angles hitherto neglected or unobserved? Why, I ask you earnestly, need we go on making commonplace little exposures of subjects that may be sorted into groups of landscapes, portraits, and figure studies? Think of the joy of doing something which it could be impossible to classify, or to tell which was the top and which was the bottom!  \n\u2014Alvin Langdon Coburn, \u201cThe Future of Pictorial Photography,\u201d 1916\n\n19  \nJoseph Cornell (American, 1903\u20131972)  \nSoap Bubble Set  \n1940, reworked 1953  \nWood, glass, paper, metal, and shell; 34.3 \u00d7 48.3 \u00d7 7.6 cm (13 1/2 \u00d7 19 \u00d7 3 in.)  \nSimeon B.

When I think of the unspeakable things that have been visited upon so many countless thousands during this same period of time I don\u2019t have too many misgivings about not having \u201cproduced\u201d more.  \n\u2014Joseph Cornell, letter to Marianne Moore, 1945\n\n20  \nSalvador Dal\u00ed (Spanish, 1904\u20131989)  \nCity of Drawers  \n1936  \nGraphite on buff wove paper; 352 \u00d7 522 mm  \nGift of Frank B. Hubachek, 1963.3  \n\nThe only difference between immortal Greece and the contemporary times is Sigmund Freud, who discovered that the human body, purely platonic in the Greek epoch, is nowadays full of secret drawers that only psychoanalysis is capable to open.  \n\u2014Salvador Dal\u00ed, The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, 1961\n\n21  \nStuart Davis (American, 1892\u20131964)  \nReady-to-Wear  \n1955  \nOil on canvas; 142.6 \u00d7 106.7 cm (56 1/8 \u00d7 42 in.)  \nRestricted gift of Mr. and Mrs. Sigmund W. Kunstadter; Goodman Endowment, 1956.137\n\nSome of the things which have made me want to paint, outside of other paintings, are . . . the brilliant colors on gasoline stations; chain-store fronts, and taxi-cabs; the music of Bach; synthetic chemistry; the poetry of Rimbeau [sic]; fast travel by train, auto, and aeroplane which brought new and multiple perspectives; electric signs; the landscape and boats of Gloucester, Mass.; 5 &amp; 10 cent store kitchen utensils; movies and radio; Earl Hines hot piano and Negro jazz music in general, etc.  \n\u2014Stuart Davis, \u201cThe Cube Root,\u201d 1943\n\n22  \nRobert Delaunay (French, 1885\u20131941)  \nChamps de Mars: The Red Tower  \n1911/23  \nOil on canvas; 160.7 \u00d7 128.6 cm (63 1/4 \u00d7 50 5/8 in.)  \nJoseph Winterbotham Collection, 1959.1  \n\nIt was thus I was able to be present at an unforgettable drama: the struggle of an artist with a subject so new that he didn\u2019t know how to capture it, to subdue it. . . . So many points of view to treat the problem of the Eiffel Tower. But Delaunay wanted to interpret it plastically. He finally succeeded with the famous canvas that everybody knows. He took the Tower apart to make it fit into his frame, he truncated it, and bent it to give it 300 meters of dizzying height, he adopted 10 points of view, 15 perspectives, so that one part is seen from below, another from above, the houses surrounding it are taken from the right, from the left, bird\u2019s-eye view, level with the ground.  \n\u2014Blaise Cendrars, \u201cThe Eiffel Tower,\u201d 1924;\n\n23  \nArthur Dove (American, 1880\u20131946)  \nMonkey Fur  \n1926  \nCorroded metal, monkey fur, tin foil, and cloth on metal; 43.2 \u00d7 30.5 cm (17 \u00d7 12 in.)  \nAlfred Stieglitz Collection, 1949.534\n\n24  \nSuzanne Duchamp (French, 1889\u20131963)  \nBroken and Restored Multiplication   \n1918\u201319  \nOil and silver paper on canvas; 61 \u00d7 50 cm (24 \u00d7 19 11/16 in.)  \nGift of Mary P. Hines in memory of her mother, Frances W. Pick; through prior acquisitions of Mr. and Mrs. Martin A. Ryerson, H. J. Willing, and Charles H. and Mary F. S. Worcester, 1994.552  \n\nEt la glace se briserait  \nL\u2019echafaudage croulerait  \nLes ballons s\u2019envolleraient  \nLes astres s\u2019eteindraient etc. . .  \n\nAnd the mirror would shatter  \nThe scaffolding would totter  \nThe balloons would fly away  \nThe stars would dim, etc. . .  \n\u2014Inscription on work\n\n25  \nCharles Eames (American, 1907\u20131978)  \nRay Eames (American, 1912\u20131988)  \nLeg Splint  \nc. 1942  \nMolded plywood; 106.7 \u00d7 19.7 \u00d7 10.8 cm (42 \u00d7 7 3/4 \u00d7 4 1/4 in.)  \nGift of Ken and Sara Isaacs, 2008.696  \n\nOne day in late 1941 a young architect and furniture designer named Charles Eames sat in his studio in Los Angeles and thought with horror of a Thomas splint [a long metal splint designed by Hugh Owen Thomas]. . . . Eames\u2019s horror was not the result of an experience with fracture but a byproduct of his search for articles that could be made out of molded plywood. He was convinced that the principles of good modern design could be applied to mass production of furniture and other common articles at no cost. . . . When war came, therefore, Eames decided to design and make a molded-plywood splint.  \n\u2014\u201cBusiness at War: Artist in Industry,\u201d Fortune, October 1944\n\n26  \nAlexandra Exter (Russian, born Poland, 1882\u20131949)  \nRobot  \n1926  \nCardboard, fabric, wood, glass, and string; h. 50.8 cm (20 in.)  \nBlock, Serlin and Saidenberg Fund; through prior gifts of Mr. and Mrs. Carter H. Harrison, Arthur Keating, and Albert Kunstadter Family Foundation, 1990.133  \n\nHer marionettes may therefore be considered in certain respects as moving sculpture or, perhaps more correctly still, as kinetic sculpto-painting. . . . All the limbs of the marionettes are so articulated at the joints as to make them easily movable in all directions. As the figures move and change position they present new combinations of variously colored round, square, triangular and other geometric and near geometric forms, running parallel, crossing, intersecting in rhythmic play.  \n\u2014Louis Lozowick, \u201cAlexandra Exter\u2019s Marionettes,\u201d Theatre Arts Monthly, 1928\n\n27  \nGeorge Grosz (American, born Germany, 1893\u20131959)  \nThe Guilty One Remains Unknown  \n1919  \nCollage composed of pen and brush and black ink, and cut and pasted newspaper and other commercially printed papers, laid down on cream wove paper; 538 \u00d7 359 mm  \nGift of Mr. and Mrs. Stanley M. Freehling, 1964.236  \n\nThe Berlin to which I returned [after World War I] was cold and gray. . . . My drawings expressed my despair, hate and disillusionment. . . . I drew drunkards; puking men; men with clenched fists cursing at the moon. . . . I drew a cross-section of a tenement house: through one window could be seen a man attacking his wife; through another, two people making love; from a third hung a suicide with body covered by swarming flies. I drew soldiers without noses; war cripples with crustacean-like steel arms; two medical soldiers putting a violent infantryman into a strait-jacket made of a horse blanket.  \n\u2014George Grosz, A Little Yes and a Big No, 1946\n\n28  \nDesigned by Reuben Haley (American, 1872\u20131933)  \nMade by Consolidated Lamp and Glass Company (American, 1893\u20131932)  \nRuba Rombic Vase  \n1928/32  \nCoraopolis, Pennsylvania  \nGlass; 23.2 \u00d7 20.3 \u00d7 19.1 cm (9 1/8 \u00d7 8 \u00d7 7 1/2 in.)  \nRaymond W. Garbe Fund in honor of Carl A. Erikson; Shirley and  \nAnthony Sallas Fund, 2000.136  \n\nThis year Consolidated has certainly outdone itself with its new \u201cRuba Rombic,\u201d which it is pleased to call \u201can epic in modern art.\u201d This is an absolutely cubist creation, and some would call it the craziest thing ever brought out in glassware. The shapes, even to the tumblers, are all twisted and distorted, though at that geometrically correct. The first reaction on viewing it is all but shock, yet the more the pieces are studied the more they appeal and there comes a realization that with all their distorted appearance they have a balance that is perfect and are true specimens of cubist art.  \n\u2014Rainbow Review Glass Journal, 1928\n\n29  \nJohn Heartfield (German, 1891\u20131968)  \nUntitled (Diagnosis)  \n1935  \nPhotogravure of photomontage; published in AIZ 14, no. 12 (Mar. 21, 1935); 39.7 \u00d7 27 cm  \nWendell D.

People like Man Ray, Kert\u00e9sz, Berenice Abbott, and others, in their portraits, give a totally new meaning to the interpretation of the lens. At this moment, photography is the most accomplished art, capable of realizing the fantastic and all that is curiously inhuman in the atmosphere that surrounds us, and even in man\u2019s very personality. . . . In Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s works, the fantastic restlessness of the street, most in keeping with the tastes of central Europe, interprets the secret elements of shadow and light, deriving a romantic flavor from them.  \n\u2014Pierre Mac Orlan, \u201cThe Literary Art of Imagination and Photography,\u201d 1928\n\n34  \nFrantisek Kupka (Czech, 1871\u20131957)  \nReminiscence of a Cathedral  \n1920\u201323  \nOil on canvas; 149.9 \u00d7 94 cm (59 \u00d7 37 in.)  \nGift of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro, 1984.6  \n\nIn our inner visions, the different fragments which float in our heads are incoherently situated in space. . . . Some parts penetrate each other; others seem completely detached, disconnected from the organism to which they are supposed to belong. The same is true of purely subjective visions where often only fragments, plexuses of forms, or colors are given. Before we can seize them and set them down, we must draw lines between them and establish a structural coherence.

Enormous enlargement of an object or a fragment gives it a personality it never had before and in this way it can become a vehicle of an entirely new lyric and plastic power.  \nI maintain that before the invention of the moving-picture no one knew the possibilities latent in a foot\u2014a hand\u2014a hat.  \n\u2014Fernand L\u00e9ger, \u201cA New Realism\u2014the Object (Its Plastic and Cinematographic Value),\u201d 1926\n\n36  \nFernand L\u00e9ger (French, 1881\u20131955)  \nComposition in Blue  \n1921\u201327  \nOil on canvas; 130.5 \u00d7 97.2 cm (51 3/8 \u00d7 38 1/4 in.)  \nCharles H. and Mary F.

In the search for vividness and intensity, I have made use of the machine as others have used the nude body or the still life. . . . I invent images from machines, as others have made landscapes from their imagination. For me, the mechanical element is not a fixed position, an attitude, but a means of succeeding in conveying a feeling of strength and power. . . . I try to create a beautiful object with mechanical elements.

I don\u2019t think highly of revolutions; mankind has to be ripe for such things. . . . I felt myself freed and had to shout my jubilation to the world. Out of parsimony I took whatever I found to do this, because we were now an impoverished country. One can even shout with refuse, and this is what I did, nailing it and gluing it together. I called it \u201cMerz\u201d; it was a prayer about the victorious end of the war, victorious as once again peace had won in the end; everything had broken down in any case and new things had to be made out of the fragments: and this is Merz.

Keys, 1985.8  \n\nDwellings of that period were cut up . . . with the grim determination that should go with any cutting process. The interiors consisted of boxes beside boxes or inside boxes, called rooms. All boxes were inside a complicated outside boxing. Each domestic function was properly box to box. I could see little sense in this inhibition, this cellular sequestration that implied ancestors familiar with penal institutions, except for the privacy of the bedrooms on the upper floor. . . . So I declared the whole lower floor as one room, cutting off the kitchen as a laboratory . . . then I screened various portions of the big room for certain domestic purposes like dining and reading.  \nFrank Lloyd Wright, The Natural House, 1954\n\n81  \nManufacturer unknown (Russia)  \nFragment (Depicting Military Elements)  \n1920s/30s  \nSilk and cotton, satin weave; probably screen-printed; 23.1 \u00d7 14.4 cm (9 1/8 \u00d7 5 5/8 in.)  \nHarriott A.
