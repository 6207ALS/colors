    "description": "<p>Architectural education in the United States began under the model of the Parisian \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and shared the French school\u2019s focus on draftsmanship and neoclassical styles until well into the 20th century. Paul McCurry was a student at the Armour Institute in Chicago (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in the decade before the school\u2019s transition to a modern curriculum under the chairmanship of the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. McCurry\u2019s education began with careful study of the Classical orders by reproducing elements from Ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy. Although this form of education came under strong criticism during the 20th century, it gave students a holistic attitude towards the arts, including artistic principles such as proportion and rhythm. Sculpture was an integral part of the architect\u2019s work, and in this freshman exercise, a memorial to the great Chicago architect John Wellborn Root, McCurry created a group of sculptural elements, including an urn and a column capital, that would allow him to design the fa\u00e7ade of a museum, library, or government building.</p>\n",
