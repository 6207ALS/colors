    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A handsome young man holds court at the center of this brilliant bowl.  Two sphinxes bow before him while immediately around him, an endless caravan circles.  The two humps identify the camels as Bactrian from today's Afghanistan.  In the next two registers and on the outside of the bowl, riders gallop energetically.  These horsemen are probably engaged in falconry, in some places you can see that the birds are on leashes.  All the movement runs from right to the left, in the same direction as the inscription on the inside and outside of this bowl's lip.  The procession of camels is closest to the regal figure at the center, suggesting that camels are more important to his wealth, power and prestige than the mounted nobleman.  Camels made the Silk Road possible, beginning around the 2nd Century BCE until the expansion of sea routes in the 16th and 17th Century CE put an end to the great caravans.  These beasts of burden transported people and goods back and forth along the 5,000 miles between Eastern Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.  Over the centuries, fortunes were made and lost, but more important are the extraordinary exchanges of ideas, beliefs and cultural practices that these journeys made possible, these exchanges changed the world and their traces are everywhere around us today.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: After you've explored the objects in these galleries, please consult the Silk Road brochure available where you picked up your player, there you'll find a map of other stops on this tour located throughout the museum.</p>\n",
