    "description": "<p>One of the first American artists to paint in Giverny, France, Theodore Robinson drew upon the teachings of the region\u2019s most famous resident, Claude Monet, in his vibrant compositions. Using layered, broken brushwork, Robinson foregrounded the slope of the hill, leading the eye from the figure at right across the Valley of Arconville and beyond. Capturing the effects of light on the landscape like Monet and other progressive French painters, Robinson nonetheless rendered his forms with a measure of solidity that was more typical of American artists who worked in an Impressionist style.</p>\n",
