    "description": "<p>Julia Fish\u2019s methodical, meditative paintings are abstracted and excerpted from her own personal experiences, memories, and immediate surroundings. Since 1991 she has drawn most often from the architectural elements of her home. \u201cThe house has become a constant companion\u2014in a sense I live inside the subject of my work,\u201d she has said. Shifting her perspective and relation to her surrounding environment, Fish\u2019s Living Room paintings began as tracings from her residence\u2019s second-floor plan: the sources of light and repeated movements are indicated by a set of marks and signs, specific to the images of each of 10 rooms. With tremendous authority and skill, Fish turns mindful recordings of studied details from her everyday experiences into a practical and strategic reflection on minimal representation and the ordinary structures that surround our daily lives.</p>\n",
