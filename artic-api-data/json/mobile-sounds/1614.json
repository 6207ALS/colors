    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Vincent van Gogh began his artistic career in his native Netherlands, making simple, often bleak depictions of peasant life in drawings and heavily dark toned paintings. In 1886, in his early thirties van Gogh arrived in Paris where his brother Theo already worked as an art dealer. Van Gogh\u2019s exposure to the experimental, often brightly colored and light filled work of avant-garde artists then working and exhibiting there was a revelation to him. In particular, van Gogh admired the work of the young artist following on the heels of the impressionist such as Georges Seurat. In this self-portrait made in 1887 van Gogh explores the new color theories and techniques pioneered by Seurat and his circle. Following in Seurat\u2019s footsteps, van Gogh builds up the painting with small dots of paint. He juxtaposes complimentary, or opposite colors to intensify their effect, for instance, the green and red in the background. The planes and contours of his thin, weary face are described with swift, lengthened brush strokes. They seem to radiate a nervous energy out toward the massive dots that swirls restlessly around his head.</p>\n",
