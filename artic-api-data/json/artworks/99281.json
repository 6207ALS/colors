The artist and the poet worked side by side in the production of these works in a true collaboration. Although it represents the unlikely partnership of an artist from Texas and a poet from the Soviet Union, the two worked well together, and their finished prints were exhibited at the legendary Leo Castelli Gallery in New York in 1979.</p>\n",
