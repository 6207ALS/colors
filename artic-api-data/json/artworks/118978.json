    "description": "<p>When Emil Nolde painted <em>Red-Haired Girl</em>, a closely cropped figure depicted with palpable emotion and fiery color, he was already widely acknowledged as a leading Expressionist artist. One year later, he joined the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 (Nazi) Party, which eventually denounced paintings in this style.</p>\n<p><em>Red-Haired Girl</em>,\u00a0along with hundreds of other works by Nolde, was confiscated by the Nazis in 1937 and displayed as an example of \u201cdegenerate art\u201d in the infamous <em>Entartete Kunst</em> exhibition, which ridiculed modern art as morally corrupt and celebrated the party\u2019s systemic attacks on artists. Despite the denunciation of his work, Nolde maintained his affiliation with the Nazis throughout the war. While Max Beckmann and Marc Chagall, whose works are on view on adjacent\u00a0walls, were forced to defect from Europe and Otto Dix was arrested as an \u201cunreliable intellectual\u201d for his anti-fascist protests, Nolde remained aligned with the Nazis. He sought their approval and embraced their ideology while also arguing that paintings like this were \u201cvigorous, durable, and ardent.\u201d</p>\n",
