    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: All of the objects in this case were made at the du Paquier porcelain manufactory established in Vienna, Austria in 1718. The manufactory\u2019s founder Claudius du Paquier wanted to capitalize on the new demand for European hard paste porcelain. Previously, objects made from this luxury material had to be imported from China and more recently Japan. But in the early eighteen century German ceramicists at Meissen finally discovered the secret of making hard paste porcelain. The du Paquier manufactory was only active for twenty-five years but in this time it produced an extraordinary range of porcelains. Chinese influenced designs were extremely popular in Europe at this time. You can see several examples of this style in the case, including this soup tureen. It is painted with overblown peonies and flowering cherry tree branches. Vividly colored birds perch and fly among them. In the long case to the right, you will find other pieces of du Paquier porcelain. These have ornamental borders of scrolling patterns, trellis work and stylized foliage also typical of the elegant du Paquier style.</p>\n",
