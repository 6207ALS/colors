Using a metal-nibbed dip pen, he composed the design using outline and contour, with no preliminary marks. His drawing is made entirely using line, except where he employed short dabs of his pen to create the seated woman\u2019s necklace.\n\nMatisse chose a well-sized, smooth paper (with only a faint screen pattern from the woven wire screen evident in raking light) suited for pen and ink. Although the paper does not have a watermark, it strongly resembles other Arches sheets the artist used for similar pen-and-ink interior drawings during this period. Microscope examination at 80\u00d7 shows that the ink extends over the left and top edges, indicating the drawing has not been cut down. There are pinholes at all corners from Matisse tacking the paper to a board on which he drew or from tacking the sheet to the wall after completion.\n\nSigned and dated: H Matisse / Juill. 44 (lower left, in pen and black ink) (fig. 54.1).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and brown-black ink. The ink appears brown except in the densest applications, where it appears black. In some pen strokes, the line starts out with a heavy black application of ink then tapers to brown as the ink thins out. The brown hue might also be due to light-induced fading, and all of the ink may have appeared black upon execution. Under magnification 150\u00d7 the ink appears translucent and brown with dark pigment particles suspended in it. Dense ink spots appear black and glossy yet seem to be the same ink based upon observation of strokes, such as those at the top right of the face, that start out black and taper to brown. Ultraviolet-light examination supports the conclusion that there is only one type of ink present; all the ink marks appear very brown under 365 nm. This ink is different from the shiny, resinous ink observed in other drawings of the period.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, smooth, cream wove paper. The bottom edge appears to have a remnant of an imitation deckle edge, indicating that the paper is moldmade. The other edges appear hand torn. This paper resembles others watermarked \u201cArches\u201d that Matisse used for pen-and-ink drawings.\n\n52.1 \u00d7 40 cm (20 1/2 \u00d7 15 7/8 in.).\n\nThere is no record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago. The upper right corner was torn and has been reattached using Japanese paper on the verso (fig. 54.2). There is a 0.5 cm tear from the top edge, near the right corner, that has also been repaired on the verso with Japanese paper.\n\nThere is a cluster of small yellow stains in the upper left quadrant. There are gentle undulations throughout. There are remnants of old hinges along the perimeter of the verso.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Frank Perls (Oct. 23, 1910\u2013Feb. 8, 1975), Beverly Hills, CA, by 1952.\n\nSold to Sidney F.
