Sheets, 1973.357\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Although not entirely self-taught, Chicago metalsmith Robert Riddle Jarvie had little experience working in precious metals. It was perhaps for this reason that in 1910 he hired John Pontius Petterson, a Norwegian-trained Swedish silversmith who had previously worked for Gorham Manufacturing Company in Providence, Rhode Island, and for Tiffany &amp; Co. in New York. That year the Jarvie Shop produced its first significant piece of presentation silver, a punch bowl modeled after Native American basketry commissioned as a gift to the Cliff Dwellers Club of Chicago, in whose collection it remains.\n\nPerhaps in an attempt to cement a growing reputation for presentation silver, Jarvie\u2019s shop produced the Art Institute\u2019s pitcher. Rather than a presentation piece from one Chicago grandee to another, the vessel commemorates the marriage of Rockford, Illinois, resident Charlotte Aileen Henry (1889\u20131957), a cousin of Jarvie\u2019s second wife, Lillian, to Raymond Warde Sheets (1889\u20131986), also of Rockford. With its flaring base, the pitcher\u2019s design evokes seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Continental pewter tankards, an allusion consistent with Jarvie\u2019s early interest in reproducing antique forms. At the same time the pitcher\u2019s surface bears the light hammer marks associated with Chicago Arts and Crafts silver. But rather than an applied monogram designed as a decorative element, which was typical of Kalo metalwork, the object displays the recipient\u2019s initials as part of an elaborate interlaced ornament, further setting it apart from the typically minimally decorated Chicago silver of the period.\n\nThe stylized initials, one centering each side of the pitcher below its mouth, are contained within an inverted heart-shaped escutcheon. The design is executed in bands of repouss\u00e9, a technique not new to Chicago metalwork or to Jarvie, and featured on examples of Jarvie\u2019s copper work as well as on the Cliff Dwellers punch bowl. But the style of the escutcheons reveals knowledge of decorative designs by Scottish-born George Grant Elmslie. Elmslie worked with Chicago architects Dankmar Adler and Louis Sullivan as a draftsman and designer of ornament prior to joining architects William Purcell and George Feick, Jr., in 1910 to form the architecture firm of Purcell, Feick and Elmslie. Elmslie\u2019s influence on the decoration on Jarvie\u2019s pitcher is seen, for instance, in Elmslie\u2019s windows for the National Farmers Bank, Owatonna, Minnesota, completed 1908. Elmslie, in turn, referenced the work of the Glasgow architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh, an example being the decorative details found in his designs for the House for an Art Lover, from 1901.\n\nJarvie knew Elmslie as a fellow Cliff Dweller of Scots lineage and mutual Minneapolis connections, and they had also worked together prior to 1911, the year the pitcher was executed. In 1909 Jarvie cast or facilitated the casting of a cup and book cover designed by Elmslie. In 1911, at Jarvie\u2019s request, Elmslie created several designs for trophies for the first Flying Machine Meet, held in Chicago. In addition, the two collaborated in 1912, when Jarvie fabricated, or arranged for the fabrication of, the hands of the Art Institute\u2019s long case clock (1971.322), which Elmslie designed for the Babson House in Riverside, Illinois. There were personal connections as well; Elmslie\u2019s future wife, Bonnie Hunter, worked in Jarvie\u2019s shop prior to their marriage, and in 1910 Jarvie retailed table linens designed and made by Elmslie\u2019s sister, Louise C. Elmslie. That Elmslie and Jarvie\u2019s relationship included an interest in each other\u2019s work can be seen in a 1911 photograph of Elmslie\u2019s apartment in Minneapolis in which three of Jarvie\u2019s Delta candlesticks (the fourth presumably obscured) appear on an Elmslie-designed dining table, surrounded by four Elmslie-designed chairs.\n\nJarvie\u2019s pitcher is the most aesthetically sophisticated and technically accomplished work from his studio up until that point. Credit for the style of its ornament must go to Elmslie; the quality of the craftsmanship may be due in part to Petterson. Regardless, the vessel represents a significant leap forward for Jarvie\u2019s shop, setting the course of his work for the several years that followed.  \nBarbara K.
