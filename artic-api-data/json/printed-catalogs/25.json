    "copy": " This handsome volume brings together an impressive array of scholars, who analyze an outstanding private collection of 171 Old Master drawings that date from the late fifteenth through the early nineteenth century. The collection vibrantly revealed here includes a wide variety of drawings\u2014from sketches and figure drawings to copies after masters and preliminary studies for major compositions\u2014and features the work of many important Italian artists, including Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Baccio Bandinelli, Pontormo, Perino del Vaga, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Salvator Rosa, Guercino, and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, among many others. Each work is reproduced and accompanied by complete documentation: physical description, provenance, bibliography, and exhibition history, as well as background information on the subjects represented in the drawings. Capturing the Sublime opens the beauty of these works to a broader public and provides important new attributions and scholarship.
