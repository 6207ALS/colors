    "transcript": "<p>the ghost.</p>\n<p>and why does she pale in comparison?<br>his skin: vibrant and stunning against the wall of flowers<br>like a tree bursting through a meadow and demanding the space<br>to be its own.<br>hers: like the dusty mantle of a fireplace, soot rubbed over<br>like a protection from the world unknown.<br>what about her must be protected?</p>\n<p>and his Blackness, his beauty, the centre of his power<br>the reason time pauses when he speaks and the reason we all<br>crane forward to listen<br>and her Blackness, regrettable &amp; forgettable<br>overlooked and unseen.<br>just because she wears her hair straight does not mean that her fist<br>does not curl up, type 3, wielded like a spear.</p>\n<p>but they gave her humanness, if you can look beyond<br>the ash of her skin. the compassion in her eyes must not be mistaken<br>for gentleness; no, she has lived too long of a life, surrounded<br>by saber-tooth tigers screaming for blood, to give<br>her heart to a world that will not follow suit.<br>when i look into his face, i remember the words of frank b. wilderson.</p>\n<p>and the Black body is dead. and her eyes are the only spark left.<br>and i wonder why the potency of a Black woman must<br>always pale in comparison to a man. she is a force of nature, power<br>unknown to those who have not lived in the same colony as she.<br>because power and pain can be synonyms, but she is more than her suffering.<br>to see her, we must allow ourselves to be free of air<br>without knowing any other source of breath.</p>\n",
