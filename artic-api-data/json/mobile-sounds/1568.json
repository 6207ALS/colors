    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Georges Seurat\u2019s painting of Parisians enjoying a leisurely afternoon on La Grande Jatte, an island in the River Seine, is one of the Art Institute\u2019s most popular works. Curator Gloria Groom:</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: I love it because it has this static quality as if everything is stopped and frozen and yet there\u2019s this little girl sort of running off to the side. We see her right behind the gentleman with his lady friend in the right-hand portion of the painting. And I think that just adds such a sense of joyfulness and she is echoed by this little pug kind of dog in the foreground of the painting, who\u2019s the other animated entity in the composition.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The painting made in the 1880s shows the wide variety of people who might spend leisure time in a modern, suburban park. Well-dressed bourgeois citizens with top hats and parasols share the space with working people. These include the pair of soldiers in the middle distance on the bank and an off-duty nurse maid who sits with her back to us, the orange ribbon from her white cap hanging down her back.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Seurat\u2019s depiction of such a social mixture was not the picture\u2019s only radical element. His way of painting this monumental canvas represented something completely new.
