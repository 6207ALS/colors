Cup fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves a small segment of the outsplayed rim and double carinated profile. The mosaic pattern is formed from sections of a single cane in an amethyst ground outlined in white, each with a central white dot and a concentric red ring surrounded by a ring of ten yellow dots. Within the amethyst cross section are scattered transparent aquamarine dots.\n\nSegment of rim preserved, three sides are broken, revealing dull edges and a dull exterior surface; the interior is repolished.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 86 Fragment of a Cup, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
