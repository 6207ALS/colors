Johnson company in Racine, Wisconsin, he wanted \u201cto get the greatest architect in the world.\u201d To him, that was Frank Lloyd Wright, renowned for his designs based on the principles of nature that integrated exterior, interior, and furnishings. The curved forms and earth tones of this armchair and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/38877/desk\">desk</a> (1972.310) echo Wright\u2019s architectural designs for the project, which included rounded brick buildings filled with columns that widened as they reached the ceiling. Although Wright was known for resisting changes to his designs, this three-legged chair proved unsteady and he altered later versions to have four feet.</p>\n",
