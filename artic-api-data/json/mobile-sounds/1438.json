    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Traces of gold leaf cling to this lacquer sculpture which represents a Buddhist deity known in Japanese as bosatsu or bodhisattva in Sanskrit. Bosatsu are compassionate beings who chose to forgo full enlightenment while they assist others on the early plain. Here the deity sits in meditation raising his hands in a symbolic gesture. Only a few eighth century Japanese sculptures like this one reside outside of Japan. This rare bosatsu figure dates to around 775 A.D. and is the only Buddhist sculpture outside Japan that can be attributed to the workshops at the Temple of T\u014ddai-ji in the city of Nara. Traditional lacquer sculpture uses a hard resin derived from plant sap applied in multiple layers to a core. But this less labor intensive sculpture was assembled with pieces of partially hallowed wood, then covered with a layer of lacquer soaked fabric. Some details such a facial features were carved in the wood. Additional lacquer paste was applied to create other fine details.</p>\n",
