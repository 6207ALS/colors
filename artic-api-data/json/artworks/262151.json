    "description": "<p>After working for architect Richard Upjohn in New York, Solon Spencer Beman (1853\u20131914) moved to Chicago in 1879 to design the model company town of Pullman, Illinois, for railcar magnate George Pullman. Beman remained in Chicago, receiving commissions to design the company town of Ivorydale, Ohio and public and commercial buildings in the midwest. Through his designs for several buildings at the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Beman developed a long-standing relationship with the Christian Science Church, bringing a classical architectural vocabulary to Christian Science churches across the United States. Solon\u2019s son, Spencer (1887\u20131952), practiced in partnership with his father until Solon\u2019s death. Spencer continued to design Christian Science for several decades, but introduced Georgian and Colonial architectural influences. Spencer was also the architect of numerous Tudor and French Revival-style residences in Chicago\u2019s North Shore communities. This collection includes a scrapbook of Solon and Spencer\u2019s architectural designs\u2014including advertisements, photographs, and published articles\u2014and photographs of Spencer\u2019s religious and residential designs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Beman,%20Solon%20S.,%20and%20Spencer%20S.%20Beman%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Beman,%20Solon%20S.,%20and%20Spencer%20S.%20Beman%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Beman,%20Solon%20S./field/creato;%20additi;%20contri/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Find all Solon S.
