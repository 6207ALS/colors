    "description": "<p>Between 1797 and his death in 1804, Domenico Tiepolo created 104 inventive wash drawings for what he called Divertimenti per li ragazzi (diversions for children). This series described the life, from birth to death, of the tragicomic commedia dell\u2019arte figure Punchinello (identified by his conical hat and beaked mask), in a loosely structured tale of an everyman.</p>\n<p>In Punchinello Collapses on the Road, we see the protagonist, surrounded by eleven of his companions and three lamenting women, in the final days before his death. While Punchinello is indeed a kind of everyman, Tiepolo also made references throughout the series to the life of Christ. This drawing calls to mind one of Christ\u2019s falls as he carried the cross.</p>\n",
