    "description": "<p>Although the majority of the Atelier Martine's textiles were designed by anonymous school girls, some patterns were provided by experienced artists or designers. One was Francis Jourdain, who trained as a painter and printmaker but turned to interior design early in his career. In addition to acting as an <em>ensemblier</em>, creating whole interior ensembles, he designed furniture, fabic, wallpaper, and stained glass. Jourdain set up an atelier to produce his furniture designs, following Poiret's example, but had no such operation for textiles, so he provided this design to the Atelier Martine.</p>\n",
