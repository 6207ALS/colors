    "description": "<p>A leader of the Mexican muralist movement of the 1920s, who sought to challenge social and political iniquities, Diego Rivera often turned to indigenous themes to foster Mexican cultural pride.</p><p>After years of rigorous art training in Mexico City, he traveled throughout Europe before settling in Paris in 1912, where he befriended other emigr\u00e9 avant-garde artists, including Amedeo Modigliani and Piet Mondrian. Rivera enjoyed a brief but sparkling period as a Cubist painter, becoming a leading member of a group of Cubists that included Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, and Jean Metzinger. Following World War I and the Russian Revolution, Rivera, like many other artists in Paris, rejected Cubism as frivolous and inappropriate for the new age. Returning to Mexico\u2014which itself had emerged from a decade of revolutionary struggle\u2014he adopted monumental forms that suited the country\u2019s new political reality and began to produce work for which he is acclaimed today: paintings, graphics, and, above all, murals depicting Mexican political and cultural life.</p><p>Although he was commissioned to paint a mural in Chicago in 1933 for the General Motors Building at the Century of Progress Exposition, a controversy over another mural resulted in negative publicity for the artist, and his commission was dismissed.</p>",
