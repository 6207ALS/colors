    "description": "<p>Stan Allen Architect\u2019s competition entry for the New Maribor Art Gallery presents a unique structural system in a bold proposal for a cultural complex that connects to the public spaces and historic architecture in Maribor, Slovenia. With the galleries elevated above street level, the glass-enclosed lobby space functions as an extension of a historic square that reaches to the banks of the Drava River. The form of the building is derived from an aggregation of pentagonal forms, with a tree-like structure in which each pentagonal shape is supported by a single radiating column. This allows for a continuous and flexible gallery space in the interior of the project. The articulated volume of the building relates to the scale and shapes of the nearby architecture, both announcing the museum\u2019s presence and linking it to the fabric of the city.</p>\n",
