For this vignette he used the back of the same block on which he carved Mahana atua four years earlier (cat. 80). On the same side, he also carved a second vignette, Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available wood block was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers onto his prints. The block is extant, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 120.1.2).\n\nIn the first-state impression on the recto of this sheet of Japanese paper, the artist had yet to fully articulate the space between the fox\u2019s two front legs and the distance between them and its muzzle. Additionally, the word Taiti is printed against a mostly black background. The sheet was trimmed in order to separate this image from its companion vignette along the bottom edge. Several posthumous uncut impressions of the whole block exist, one in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, in which the distance between compositions may be assessed (fig. 120.1.3).\n\nOn the verso, a faintly printed impression with black ink offset along the perimeter appears to be a third-state impression that is likely a maculature impression printed on top of a small colored-pencil landscape that Gauguin had drawn previously.\n\nThe artist pasted an impression of the third state of this print onto page 188 of his Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 120.1.4), which suggests that it held particular significance for him. A detail of the lower left of that impression highlights the subtle, and often obscured, PG monogram and the flourishes around it (fig. 120.1.5).\n\nFox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints, none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThe wood-block prints were printed in black ink. On the verso, Gauguin used blue and green pencils to draw a tree with leaves and a rolling landscape behind it (fig. 120.1.1).\n\nThe sheet was trimmed, as evidenced by the cropping of the landscape and its separation along the bottom from a second image printed on the same block (cat. 111). Given the shortage of paper at this point in his career, it is not unusual to find that Gauguin reused this sheet of paper to remove residual ink from the block and thereby create a maculature impression on the verso (see also cat. 53.2).\n\n105 \u00d7 185 mm (image, recto); 110 \u00d7 185 mm (image, verso); 115 \u00d7 196 mm (sheet)\n\nThe sheet is in sound, stable condition. There are pinholes in the four corners that retain slight residues of rust. There are minute creases along the edges and especially in the lower right and left corners. Along the diagonal crease in the lower left corner of the verso, there is some caked dirt that intermingles with the graphite inscription.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
