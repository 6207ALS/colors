It progresses, stalls, rewinds, and deflects through a series of ritual-like preparations.

Recognizing the body as an evolving repository for both physical and psychological life, Boomerang uses idiosyncratic movement, unpredictable phrasing, and a commitment to full-\u00adon embodied motion to create intense explorations of how human histories might be sensitively layered, distorted, and re-contextualized.</p><p>Boomerang is keen on presenting their work in a wide variety of alternative spaces, from parks to vineyards, the streets to the mountains, and within academic and school contexts. In the United States, their work has been presented in New York, Cleveland, Chicago, Pittsburgh, and Grand Rapids. In 2015, they made their European debut with residencies and performances at Lake Studios Berlin and Tragant Dansa in Barcelona. Most recently, they premiered their work at the Arts Arena in Paris as well at the Berliner Festspiele in Berlin at the invitation of world-renowned theater director Robert Wilson. </p><p>><strong>Related programming:</strong><strong ><a href=\"/event/drop-workshop-boomerang\" >Drop-In Workshop: Boomerang<br></a></strong>January 27 at 11:00<br>Griffin Court <br>Free with museum admission</p><p><strong>This event is part of Teen Programs' </strong><strong><a href=\"/event/free-thursday-hangs-boomerang\">Free Thursday Night Hangs</a>.</strong></p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
