    "description": "<p>When Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Vincent made this endearing portrait of Marie-Gabrielle Capet in 1790, he had just been appointed professor at the Royal Academy and curator of the king\u2019s drawings collection. Capet came from Lyons to Paris to study with Vincent\u2019s life-long companion, the portraitist and miniaturist Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard. Capet became her favorite pupil, then their housemate and model, and ultimately their caretaker in old age. The artist\u2019s use of three chalks and deliberate grace reflects the preceding era of the Rococo more than the severity of the Neoclassical, revolutionary era.</p>\n",
