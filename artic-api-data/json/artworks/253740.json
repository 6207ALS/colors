    "description": "<p>Festive orbs in yellow, red, and brown at the ends of thin angled lines suggest the sparking bursts of light that erupt when a roman candle combusts. Joel Robinson\u2019s stylized interpretation of the popular firework conveys a celebratory sensibility, while also hinting at the precision associated with his architectural training. <em>Roman Candles</em> was used as upholstery fabric for a chair included in the 1951 Chicago Good Design show at the Merchandise Mart. Designed for the firm of L. Anton Maix, it was one of at least two patterns that Robinson designed that year. Also included in the 1951 collection was <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/153677\"><em>Ovals</em></a>, which featured prominently in the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Good Design installation from that same year. The Good Design exhibitions, a partnership project between the Merchandise Mart and MoMA, sought to showcase the \u201cbest designed new products\u201d defined as \u201cDesign intended for present-day life, in regard to usefulness, to production methods and materials and to the progressive taste of the day.\u201d Although Robinson garners little mention today in art and design history books, during the 1950s, his modern fabric designs proved popular and were included in the 1951, 1952, and 1955 Good Design exhibitions.</p>\n",
