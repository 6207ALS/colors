To illustrate Matisse\u2019s \u201cpassion for form,\u201d Fry used the example of Girl with a Cat, which he knew from its presentation in the 1910 exhibition Manet and the Post-Impressionists at his Grafton Galleries in London. Fry wrote:\n\nHere the line is much more deliberate, . . . much slower in tempo [sic] . . . Sensitive it remains, but in this case we are much more concerned with the position of the lines, their power of evolving the idea of volume and mass than with the quantities of the lines in themselves. It is a more definitely plastic and constructive design. It is typical of the kind of synthesis, which has become possible to the modern artist . . . who is free therefore to aim at the elimination of all but the essential forms, not of description but of plastic construction.\n\nGirl with a Cat\u2019s composition relates to an oil-and-canvas work from the same year and of the same sitter (fig. 17.1), Matisse\u2019s sixteen-year-old daughter, Marguerite (see fig. 17.2). The drawing was likely made in advance of or during the process of painting; light pencil marks reveal the artist\u2019s first attempts to place his sitter\u2019s head, right eye, and the bottom of her nose as well as the initial contours of her right arm on the sheet. As he subsequently raised and compressed the figure, Matisse adjusted the top framing line; darker, thicker marks of graphite atop the earlier ones indicate his effort to solidify and reinforce the final form. The three pinholes at the top of the sheet, likely made by the artist, are the result of it being tacked to a wall or other surface.\n\nExamining this work alongside the painting, we can see how Matisse continued the direction of the drawing as he reworked the graphite composition in oil. He retained the heavily outlined forms and suspended Marguerite\u2019s hand against a similar dark mass (one of only two places in the drawing that he chose to fill so densely). At the same time, he expanded on the plastic construction of his drawing by employing overlapping strokes of paint and then took the canvas still further: using the diagonal beadboard only minimally indicated on the sheet, he distorted the symmetry of the painting. He also enlivened the once spare composition with vibrant, youthful color. Both the drawing and painting, as art historian Alfred H. Barr noted, are built on a \u201csubtle game of tensions and balances.\u201d\n\nMatisse\u2019s always sensitive pairing of medium and means to achieve his artistic goals is especially evident when these two compositions are compared to another drawing and painting pair made in 1910: Girl with Tulips (Jeanne Vaderin) (fig. 17.3) and Girl with Tulips (fig. 17.4). For the drawing, Matisse chose charcoal rather than graphite, and he repeatedly drew, rubbed, and wiped as he turned the figure\u2014his neighbor, Jeanne Vaderin\u2014from a fully frontal to an angled pose. Evidence of Vaderin\u2019s gradual rotation is clear in the area of her right cheek and is reinforced by the diagonals that run from the top of her head down her arms. The sitter\u2019s body and limbs are articulated by a busy network of form-grasping lines that impart a sense of fluidity and animation. In this particular pair, it is the figure that is distorted and unstable in contrast to the more level line of beadboard.\n\nThe differences between the two portraits of Marguerite and the painting and drawing of Vaderin may be the result of Matisse\u2019s concurrent work in sculpture, particularly the first two of his five busts of his neighbor, known as Jeannette (I\u2013V) (Jan.\u2013Mar. [?] 1910 [I, II]; fig. 17.5 and fig. 17.6). The need for a more haptic experience of form may have informed his decision to use charcoal for this image of Vaderin. In contrast, the Art Institute\u2019s drawing has a firmness that is accentuated by the graphite and reinforces Barr\u2019s description of the composition\u2019s hieratic quality as that of a \u201cRomanesque or Byzantine saint.\u201d Indeed, it is that refined sensibility and sureness of medium and its potential for expression that an individual working on the Grafton Galleries exhibition identified just months after Matisse completed Girl with a Cat, describing the drawing as: \u201cgirl &amp; cat . . . big dg [drawing] big feeling after having years of lessons.\u201d  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew his subject with graphite pencil on ivory laid paper, making only slight adjustments with an eraser. He initially placed the compositional elements with a light sketch and then returned to them with heavier, darker lines to establish the contours of the figure and add shading. He erased the eyes and repositioned them higher (see fig. 17.7). Matisse drew on the smoother, felt side of the laid paper so that the pencil lines would not emphasize the laid and chain-line texture.\n\nThere are passages that resemble incised or scraped lines, such as in the body of the cat below the proper right hand and along the proper left arm. These are inadvertent marks caused by a hard inclusion in the graphite pencil that scratched the surface of the paper as Matisse drew (see fig. 17.8).\n\nThere are three pinholes along the top edge; one at the center and one at each corner. The pinholes were made after the image was created.\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 17.9); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1\u20131.2 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, off-white color and makes another contrasting 5\u20137 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 32.7 \u00d7 27 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue is evident along the lower left corner under magnification 80\u00d7.\n\nSigned: Henri Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 17.10).\n\nGraphite with traces of erasing.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, ivory laid paper (discolored to cream). Chain lines run horizontally at 2.5 cm intervals. The laid line frequency is 9/cm. A watermark in the center of the sheet reads: ORIGINAL / MARRAN PAPER (6.6 \u00d7 17.4 cm) (see fig. 17.11). The German paper wholesaler R\u00f6merturm owned this watermark and commissioned papers watermarked with it. This paper is known to have been in use from 1906 to 1913. The edges are unevenly trimmed. The top edge was trimmed after the drawing was completed.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, off-white wove paper. The edges are straight cut. The texture on the recto has been compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 17.12), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light (fig. 17.13).\n\nPrimary support: 27.7 \u00d7 21.7 cm (10 7/8 \u00d7 9 1/2 in.); secondary support: 29.7 \u00d7 24 cm (11 5/8 \u00d7 9 3/8 in.); tertiary support: 44.4 \u00d7 34 cm (17 1/2 \u00d7 13 1/2 in.).\n\nIn 2015 minor treatment was carried out to remove graphite notes from the tertiary support. There is no evidence that the work has undergone other treatment.\n\nThe primary support is torn along the lower left corner. This tear existed before the sheet was mounted and was realigned and secured by the dry mounting process. The primary support and a 0.5 cm band of the top margin of the secondary support have darkened from exposure to light. The original paper color is preserved along the right and left margins. There is light surface soil evident across all supports. There is a brown foxing spot in the upper right of the tertiary support. There is a faint tideline stain near the upper left corner on the tertiary support. On the verso, there is stray brown and blue media.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Emily Crane Chadbourne (Mar. 4, 1871\u2013Dec. 23, 1964), Stone Ridge, NY, by Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Dec. 21, 1926.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 21, 1926.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, as Drawing (no. 176).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 1032, as Girl with Cat.\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, Modern Drawings, Feb. 16\u2013May 10, 1944, no cat. no., as Girl with Cat, 1910.\n\nSanta Barbara Museum of Art, Nineteenth Century French, American, and English Drawings, Lent by the Art Institute of Chicago, 1947, no cat.\n\nJacksonville, Ill., Pfeiffer Library, MacMurray College, Exhibition of Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 1947, no cat.\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse: Retrospective 1966, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 155 (ill.), as Study for Painting of Marguerite Matisse of 1910/Etude pour Jeune Fille au chat noir (Marguerite Matisse) and Study for Painting of Marguerite Matisse of 1910/Etude pour Jeune fille au chat noir/(Study for Girl with Black Cat, No. 30); Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\nDarmstadt, Germany, Mathildenh\u00f6he, 3.

Fry and Matisse knew each other for some time and he, along with the aesthete Matthew Steward Prichard, were likely responsible for the introduction of Emily Crane Chadbourne (the first owner of this work) to the artist; see cat. 15 for more on Chadbourne and her first visit to Matisse.\n\nFry, \u201cLine as Means of Expression,\u201d p. 206.\n\nSuch framing lines, while not completely uncommon, are rare in Matisse\u2019s drawings and here reflect not only the composition but also the dimensions of the support. This strengthens the idea that the drawing and painting were made concurrently.\n\nThis work was not examined in person, but reproductions suggest that it too witnessed an evolution as it was made: darker blue strokes near the sitter\u2019s shoulder and neck suggest an earlier placement of her body. In this sense, the painting relates to the larger trajectory of Matisse\u2019s work in 1913\u201317, in which there is such a high degree of visible reworking that we must reconsider the traditional term pentimenti to describe it. Though the artist could scrape, wipe down, or start a new canvas if work on a painting disagreed with him, he rarely exercised these options during those years. Instead, many of the canvases and sheets, in their heavily worked and revised final states, indicate that his subject included the act of creation itself. For more on this concept, see Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro and John Elderfield, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, exh. cat.
