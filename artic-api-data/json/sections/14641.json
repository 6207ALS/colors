StrotherSketch of the Peacock Room, 1898  \nGraphite (recto) on cream wove paper with printed text in black ink (verso); 18.8 \u00d7 17.9 cm (7 3/8 \u00d7 7 1/16 in.)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, the Charles Deering Collection, 1927.5883\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">James McNeill Whistler completed his masterpiece of interior design, Harmony in Blue and Gold: The Peacock Room (now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC), in 1877. The design was the result of a commission to decorate the dining room of the London home of Frederick Leyland; the project eventually led to a bitter dispute between artist and patron that abruptly ended Whistler and Leyland\u2019s previously fruitful relationship. Whistler may have never again set eyes on the Peacock Room after leaving London for Venice in September of 1879.\n\nAlmost two decades later, as the Sketch of the Peacock Room attests, the room was still on the artist\u2019s mind. The drawing focuses on the six complete peacocks Whistler incorporated into the room\u2019s design: four distributed over the three opulent window shutters along the room\u2019s eastern side, and two more locked in combat\u2014an allegorical representation of the quarrel between Whistler and Leyland\u2014within a large mural on the top half of the south wall (see fig. 48.1 and fig. 48.2; [YMSM 178] for photographs of the room showing these features). Between his sketches of the shutters, Whistler summarily indicated some of the room\u2019s other architectural features and peacock feather\u2013inspired motifs. The drawing is neither a detailed nor an especially accurate rendering of the room\u2019s design. Whistler, for example, misrepresented the space between the shutters, elongated the wing feathers of the two fighting peacocks so that they overlap, and generally struggled with the compositional details. Nevertheless, as both Margaret MacDonald and Linda Merrill have observed, the artist\u2019s energetic strokes of graphite capture the vibrancy of the rich d\u00e9cor.\n\nWhistler made several sketches from memory of the Peacock Room throughout the years following its completion. As the inscription along the bottom of the sheet indicates, the Art Institute\u2019s example was drawn for the artist Albert Ludovici on December 17, 1898. Its purpose, in Ludovici\u2019s words, was \u201cto give me an idea of it.\u201d The two men had first met in 1884 in Whistler\u2019s studio; Ludovici later noted of that first encounter, \u201cI felt I was in the presence of a great artist.\u201d Throughout 1898 they were in regular contact, collaborating on the organization of the first and second exhibitions of the recently formed International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers (ISSPG). The London-based society\u2019s Executive Council had enlisted Ludovici to act as its delegate in Paris, where he had trained and maintained close connections, in an effort to convince French artists to send their works for exhibition. Whistler, the society\u2019s inaugural president, supervised and aided his efforts. For the first show, held earlier that year, they had succeeded in securing loans of works by Paul C\u00e9zanne, \u00c9douard Manet, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, among others. Given Whistler and Ludovici\u2019s collaboration in the ISSPG, it is fitting that Ludovici later loaned the sketch of the Peacock Room to the Whistler memorial exhibition organized by the society in 1905.\n\nWords printed on the verso of the drawing further illuminate the circumstances under which it was made. A notice proclaims in bold lettering that \u201cthe Restaurant Frascati (with special musical programmes) will be open on Christmas Day from 6 p.m. and all day on the Bank Holiday.\u201d The repetition of this phrase in both French and German bespeaks the restaurant\u2019s international clientele. Located on Oxford Street in London, Frascati\u2019s was a popular dining destination, appearing in multiple contemporary city guidebooks. As one such guidebook records, it was \u201cthe one restaurant in London conducted in continental style\u2014such as one meets with everywhere on the Boulevards of Paris.\u201d It is easy to imagine that the two artists, who often crossed paths in Paris, would have gravitated toward this kind of dining establishment when sharing a meal in London.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Whistler might easily have co-opted something close at hand\u2014such as this flyer\u2014to make his impromptu sketch on the back. Frascati\u2019s striking d\u00e9cor held a further attraction. Another guidebook elaborates on the design of the restaurant\u2019s grill room: \u201ca gorgeous hall of white marble, veined with black, with a golden frieze and a golden ceiling. . . . There are gold and silver everywhere . . . . What is not gold or shining glass is either light buff or delicate grey, and electric globes in profusion, palms, bronze statuettes, and a great dome of green glass and gilding all go to make a gorgeous setting.\u201d For Whistler, the palatial interior, particularly the green dome and the profuse gilding, may well have recalled the splendor of the green-blue and gold Peacock Room he had designed twenty years prior.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Sketch of the Peacock Room corresponds to Margaret F.
