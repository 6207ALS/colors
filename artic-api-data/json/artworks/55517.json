    "description": "<p>In the 1923 silent short of the same title, Man Ray filmed barely discernible scenes of Paris at night along with his own enigmatic photograms and conglomerations of spiraling or gyrating objects. The resulting sequence of near-total abstractions seems devoid of sense or purpose. The &quot;return to reason&quot; in the film comes finally in the form of a woman's torso\u2014modeled by cabaret personality Kiki de Montparnasse\u2014turning to and fro beside a rain-covered windowpane. Man Ray reproduced the seductive finale, as well as other moments from the film, as photographs, singly and in strips. A still from Man Ray's film, this particular photograph appeared on its own in the first issue of the key avant-garde journal <em>La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste</em>, in 1924.</p>\n",
