    "short_description": "The Donna and Howard Stone Gallery for Film, Video, and New Media features a new work by Finnish artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila. Ahtila\u2019s films, culled from research and interviews with individuals suffering from psychotic disorders, are sensual, profoundly moving vignettes. Her chosen subject matter lends itself easily to perceptual distortions, as series of images flow seamlessly between reality and illusion and draw the viewer into uncanny and deeply fractured environments.",
