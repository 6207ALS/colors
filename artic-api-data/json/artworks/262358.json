    "description": "<p>Practicing primarily in Wichita, Kansas, Richard Ten Eyck (b. 1920) was among the leading industrial designers in the Midwest during the post-World War II period. Best known for his long-standing work for Cessna Aircraft and Bell Helicopters and for heavy equipment manufacturers such as Barber-Greene, Case/Davis, and Hesston, Ten Eyck founded his office, Richard Ten Eyck Associates, in 1948. Among his most recognized designs are the first models of the streamlined Vornado fans, one of the enduring product designs of the 1940s and 1950s. The collection primarily contains photographs, slides, and advertising and promotional materials. This material was used in preparation for an exhibition of Ten Eyck\u2019s work, organized by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1999.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Ten%20Eyck,%20Richard,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Ten%20Eyck,%20Richard,%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Ten%20Eyck,%20Richard/field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Richard Ten Eyck Oral History.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
