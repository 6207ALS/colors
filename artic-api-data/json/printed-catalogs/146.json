    "copy": " This engaging volume describes the creation and restoration of the extraordinary large-scale drawing The Temptation of Saint Anthony \u2014a work by late 19th-century Belgian artist James Ensor (1860\u20131949)\u2014on the occasion of its first public showing in more than 60 years. The piece is composed of 51 separate sheets of paper collaged into a hallucinatory social critique and artist\u2019s manifesto. Each sheet of the nearly six-foot-high work is reproduced at actual size, revealing Ensor\u2019s remarkable technique and fertile imagination. Here, Saint Anthony is surrounded not with nature, as customary, but with the moral decay of society. Replete with tiny scenes depicting both sexual temptation and spiritual piety, Ensor splices potent imagery from travelogues, popular science, and technology magazines into a Symbolist masterpiece. Susan M. Canning, Patrick Floriz\u00f6one, and Nancy Ireson analyze the drawing\u2019s meaning; Herwig Todts details its origins and early history; and Kimberly J. Nichols recounts the work\u2019s restoration.   Susan M. Canning, Patrick Florizoone, Nancy Ireson, and Kimberly J. Nichols With a preface by Herwig Todts   144 pages, 9 x 12 in. 98 color ills., with foldout Hardcover $35.00 ($31.50 members) ISBN: 978-0-300-20391-2 ",
