Gauguin approached his study of his Tahitian environment as if he were embarking on a scientific research project. This can be explained in large part by the fact that he received funding for the voyage from the French Ministry of Public Education and Fine Arts; he had asked for support \u201cto study and ultimately paint the customs and landscapes of Tahiti.\u201d In a letter of March 11, 1892\u2014not quite a year into his \u201cresearch\u201d on the island\u2014he explained to his friend Georges Daniel de Monfreid, \u201cI am working all the time, but up till now only studies, or rather documents are piling up. If they are not useful to me they will be so to others.\u201d Two sketchbook sheets from his 1891/93 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian sketchbook) (see fig. 42.2) depict a woman with a rather intricate hairstyle and facial characteristics that are similar to those of the subject of the Art Institute\u2019s Head of a Tahitian Woman. The sketch on the left outlines the woman\u2019s ornate hairstyle, while on the right her face more closely resembles the Art Institute\u2019s drawing: the woman\u2019s lips are firmly closed as she glances through heavy eyelids in the direction of the artist, offering no recognition of the person translating her image onto paper. It is likely that Gauguin, while referencing the images in his sketchbook back in his Tahitian studio, chose to flesh out the Art Institute\u2019s more detailed rendering of the woman he had observed.\n\nRecent technical analysis revealed that three works in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (fig. 42.3 [cat. 39], fig. 42.4 [cat. 40, and fig. 42.5 [cat. 41]) are closely related to Head of a Tahitian Woman. All four are on pieces of parchment of the same size. Gauguin may have used parchment because of its durability and strength. He retouched three of the four works with additional media after the initial pen-and-ink drawing faded to brown, perhaps because he had hung them in his sunny studio in Tahiti. All of this indicates that Gauguin intended to handle and look often at these sheets, which must have been among the precious \u201cdocuments\u201d he traveled with and consulted over the years.\n\nGauguin probably did not attempt to refresh the by-now faint parchment drawings\u2014adding black ink and watercolor over the faded compositions\u2014until after his return to France in 1894. In the one work he did not retouch, Ten Studies of Tahitian Figures (fig. 42.3), faded ink and watercolor washes are quite evident. He also seems to have used this drawing to test his hand at working with a reed pen on parchment: stray test marks appear in the upper left of the sheet, and the figures are described in lines that are often unsteady and uneven in thickness. This work\u2014with its quick sketches of Tahitians in various poses\u2014is not a fully rendered composition, and evidently the artist did not think it important enough to require reinforcement. The same faded brown ink was discovered underneath the retouching of Head of a Tahitian Woman, in which Gauguin also added green watercolor to the figure\u2019s face and black ink to her hair. Scientific analysis revealed that a drop of green to the left of the head of the seated female in another of the related drawings on parchment, Two Tahitian Women and a Marquesan Earplug (fig. 42.5), is the same pigment that Gauguin used to color the face in Head of a Tahitian Woman. Moreover, the exact green appears in grass depicted in the third work on parchment, Tahitians Fishing (fig. 42.4). For the large tree in this scene, Gauguin used dark, carbon black ink that he employed in reinforcing the hair of the woman in the present drawing. The appearance of the same media in a number of works suggests that Gauguin developed this group collectively, displayed them together in his Tahitian studio, and then transported them back to Paris in one of his portfolios.\n\nThe attention Gauguin lavished on Head of a Tahitian Woman indicates that he was either particularly fond of the image or intended to sell it, for in 1894/95 he was attempting to raise funds in Paris for his second Tahitian trip. Or perhaps he was trying to promote the painting related to the Art Institute\u2019s sheet, Les parau parau (Conversation) (fig. 42.6 [W 435]), since the oil was offered for sale at H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, in 1895. The head in the drawing appears in the painting on a recumbent woman in a group of people conversing in the center-left background; she is the only figure who looks in the direction of the viewer.\n\nThe head on the Art Institute\u2019s sheet is much larger than the one in Les parau parau. Yet, when the drawing is reduced to the same scale as the painting, the two heads line up almost perfectly (see fig. 42.7). This suggests that Gauguin either used the drawing as a study for the painting (squaring it on another piece of paper for reduction and transfer to the canvas), or he traced the likeness onto the parchment from another source, such as a photograph. Gauguin\u2019s working methods are difficult to determine, as he often recycled imagery from one medium to another and from one context to another. Some of his sketched figures appear larger in related paintings while others are much smaller; sometimes one-to-one tracing is evident. Here, it is clear that the lines and forms are nearly identical, albeit on a different scale.\n\nThere is a definite kinship between the Art Institute\u2019s drawing and two by Vincent van Gogh that Gauguin owned and kept with his \u201cdocuments.\u201d Both are part of a series in which Van Gogh sought to emulate Japanese wood-block prints. The first (fig. 42.8) is a small sketch of the Dutch artist\u2019s 1888 painting The Mousm\u00e9 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). Adorning the background and the seated female\u2019s dress are dashes, dots, and fluid lines\u2014simulating similar effects in Japanese prints\u2014made by a reed pen. Gauguin was likewise influenced by such prints; in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, the marks in the background and flowing contour lines that defines the woman\u2019s profile are similar to those in Van Gogh\u2019s sketch. The subject\u2019s bouffant hairstyle recalls depictions of women in Japanese prints (see fig. 42.9). In its handling, a second drawing by Van Gogh in Gauguin\u2019s possession, a circa 1888 portrait of Patience Escalier (fig. 42.10), also resembles that in Head of a Tahitian Woman. At the top of the drawing of Mousm\u00e9, Gauguin wrote the following inscription: d\u00f9 regrett\u00e9 Vincent van Gogh (by the lamented Vincent van Gogh). He further indicated Van Gogh\u2019s importance to him when he pasted this drawing into his 1893\u20131901 bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly from the artist to \u00c9mile Bernard (1868\u20131941), Paris, until at least 1929.\n\nMrs. Diego (Evelyn Marshall) Suarez (1888\u20131979), New York, by 1946.\n\nBy descent to her grandson, Marshall Field V, and his wife Jamee, Chicago.\n\nPromised gift of Jamee and Marshall Field V to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Loan Exhibition of Paul Gauguin, for the Benefit of the New York Infirmary, Apr. 3\u2013May 4, 1946, cat. 50 (ill.).\n\nPalm Beach, Fla., Society of the Four Arts, Paul Gauguin, 1848\u20131903, Feb. 4\u2013Mar. 4, 1956, cat. 36.\n\nNew York, Solomon R.
