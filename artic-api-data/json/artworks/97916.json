    "description": "<p>Although born, raised, and educated on the East Coast, Frederic Remington achieved considerable success as America\u2019s leading illustrator of life on the western frontier. In 1894 he turned his skill and energy to sculpture. This vigorous portrayal of a cowboy taming a wild horse was the artist\u2019s first effort in bronze, and with an illustrator\u2019s eye for drama, he captured the single most illuminating moment of the event. Although the horse and rider struggle against each other, they are pulled together at the instant of utmost exertion. As the bronco rears up, back arched and splayed tail snapping, the cowboy leans forward, his whip suspended in midair as he clutches the reins and horse\u2019s mane. This minutely rendered, spirited, and technically remarkable depiction of life in the West became one of the most popular American bronzes of the early twentieth century. The Art Institute\u2019s version is one of nearly seventy made at the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company of New York using the French sand-casting method.</p>\n",
