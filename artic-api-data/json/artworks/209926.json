    "description": "<p>Robert Rauschenberg is best known for the \u201ccombine,\u201d a hybrid form of painting and sculpture that integrates humble materials, found images, and paint to bridge what he called \u201cthe gap between art and life.\u201d Rauschenberg submitted <em>Short Circuit</em> for an annual exhibition at Stable Gallery in 1955. He invited friends to produce small pieces that could be smuggled into the exhibition in his cabinet-shaped construction. A painting by his former wife, artist Susan Weil, appears behind the right door, and a flag composition by Jasper Johns once sat behind the left door. (It went missing in 1965 and was replaced at Rauschenberg\u2019s invitation with a facsimile by the artist Sturtevant.) The work also includes a Judy Garland autograph, an image of Abraham Lincoln, and a postcard of grazing cows, among other items. While <em>Short Circuit</em> captures aspects of a collective American experience, it also ranks among the most personal of Rauschenberg\u2019s combines.</p>\n",
