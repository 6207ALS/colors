    "copy": " Ballplayers, Gods, and Rainmaker Kings: Masterpieces from Ancient Mexico celebrates the bicentennial of Mexico's independence from Spain and the centennial of the 1910 Revolution, which led to the creation of the modern Mexican republic. The exhibition and accompanying catalogue\u2014drawn from the collections of the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda de la Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa; and the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014present seventeen sculptural masterpieces from Mexico's ancient civilizations, revealing the distinctive styles and symbolic forms of different societies that flourished between 900 B.C. and A.D. 1521. While stylistically and conceptually diverse, these compelling objects share a fundamental worldview, in which human society was perceived as an integral part of the dynamic order of nature. Published as a bilingual text, the beautifully illustrated catalogue also reiterates the museum's commitment and outreach to the large Spanish-speaking community in Chicago and throughout the world.   Richard Townsend with Elizabeth Pope   40 pages, 9 1/2 x 8 5/8 in. 40 ills. Out of print ISBN: 978-0-865-59242-1 ",
