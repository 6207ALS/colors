A small artist\u2019s patch formerly covered the anus of the figure being crushed by the wheel. There are several pinholes in the upper area of the sheet; this suggests that at one time it was pinned to another surface, perhaps together with folio 6H/I. The present sheet\u2019s right edge is irregularly cut where it was separated from a larger folio. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Sheet 7I. Interactive image.\n\nfig. 2 </section>",
