A. McN. Whistler.\n\nARTS CLUB.  \nHANOVER SQUARE.  \nW. [London]  \n[1878/82]\n\nDear Way I will do my best\u2014and if I dont turn up tomorrow at about 10\u2014I will the next day\u2014  \n\nI am dropping about with sleep\u2014  \n\nGoodnight\u2014  \nEver yours  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n[21] Wellington St.  \n[Strand, W.C., London]  \nFeby 12. 1880.\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler.  \n\nThe sale is over and I think most satisfactorily. Your works have sold very well\u2014The Etchings of The Forge\u2014Speke and Battersea fetched\u2014Twenty pounds ten shillings. The Bundle of Crayon Sketches and photos\u2014Nineteen pounds ten and you may be sure they were pretty well rubbed out. The two framed studies of Miss F. in the Old Chair [see fig. 1] / \u00a35.5. and \u00a33.7.6\u2014(the last I bought) the little nude from the Grosvenor \u00a34.0.0. The Connie\u201450 gns\u2014and \u201cThe Creditor\u201d \u00a312.12\u2014So that you see no harm has been done you\u2014I have got the Bust\u2014\n\nHowell\u2014Eldon\u2014and Mitford were there besides a host of others and if you could have dropped upon us you would have been welcomed with shouts.\n\nThis is I hope the last act of the Melodrama\u2014and hence forth I firmly believe that you have it in your hands to / shape a bright and successful future\u2014I hear that the Doctor has a note from you complaining of cold etc. but I have not seen it\u2014Do write to Huish. He was at the sale to day and I think is most anxious to serve you so let him have a little encouragement\u2014  \n\nGood bye, I must shut up to save the post.  \n\nYours faithfully  \nThos Way\n\n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, April 15th 1880.\n\nMy dear Dr. Whistler\u2014  \n\nWe have had our final meeting and nothing more is to be said about the 3 Girls or the pictures at yours about which bye the way Mr. Leyland was good enough to take my word that they were of no commercial value and did not belong to the Estate. I think you will be surprised at Mr. Lewis\u2019s proceedings.\n\nEverything was arranged as well as I could wish\u2014My offer for the canvasses etc. accepted\u2014the two with you to be left unmolested and / the question of Mr. Leyland\u2019s claim to be referred to the decision of Lewis. We were on our legs ready to go\u2014when in came the Clerk from him\u2014with the decision that Mr. Leyland\u2019s claim was indefeasable and that the picture must be delivered to him forthwith!\u2014Of course there was nothing that I could say or do in the face of this. Your letter I could not quote and I could only console myself with the reflection that after all it is better that it should be with Leyland than in the hands of a rascally dealer who might have / bought it had it been put up for sale\u2014\n\nI must beg you to exonerate me from blame when you write to or see your brother\u2014I have done what I could to carry out his wishes and to be defeated through the defection of the person paid most handsomely to protect his interests is most annoying.\n\nGood bye My Dear Doctor\u2014When we meet again if we ever do I trust we shall have a happier subject of conversation\u2014\n\nYours faithfully.  \nThomas Way.\n\n[fig. 2]\n\n21 Wellington St  \n[Strand, W.C, London]  \nMay 1st [1880]\n\nMy dear Teacher\u2014  \n\nJust one line in acknowledgement of yours\u2014I am very poor just now having spent my earnings a long way in advance for the purchase of new machinery\u2014but I will do what I can to extricate you from your diffs\u2014only it will take perhaps a few days\u2014Meanwhile I know that I can depend upon you not to increase them seriously\u2014Would you just drop me a line to say what is really the lowest sum / that will clear you and bring you home comfortably for \u201cfivers\u201d even are matters of calculation now adays\u2014\n\nI too, hope much from the pastels and have not been unobservant of the straws floating on Society since you left. When you come I think that I may be able to suggest a hint or two to help the \u201cshow\u201d\u2014Meanwhile (again) I have been very anxious about the careful transit of these same for I know how soon they are injured. Can you have / a dozen slight deal boxes made the exact size of the paper each to hold a limited number of the pastels\u2014with tissue between each\u2014and no room for shaking and consequent rubbing\u2014They should be packed\u2014if possible\u2014under the eye of someone from the consulate who should be asked to sign them to show that there is nothing contraband\u2014Thus you would be saved the risk of their being over hauled on the homeward journey\u2014\n\nGood bye\u2014If I have sometimes said that which I ought not to have said and left unsaid that which I ought to have said you must bear / with me\u2014and set it against my deeds which may be more satisfactory.\n\nYesterday I went to the Grosvenor Private View\u2014It is the worst show they have had. Phil Morris is all over the place and very weak\u2014Albert Moore fairly good\u2014Burne Jones weak and insipid\u2014The best work is a portrait by Frank Holl who beats Millais in strength and bottles up poor Gregory entirely\u2014Bob Macbeth a failure as usual\u2014\n\nThere was a great gathering of Beauty and fashion upon which we gazed as savages\u2014with wonder\u2014  \n\nYours faithfully.  \nT. Way.\n\n[28 Wimpole Street, London]  \n[late 1880?]\n\nDear Tom\u2014Don\u2019t be alarmed but I am so ill that my brother has kept me here to doctor\u2014\n\nHowever he seems to think that I may still get round in the course of the morning to you\u2014\n\nMeanwhile like a good fellow will you and your Father watch a little over the proofs etc etc\u2014and let no prying spies come into the place\u2014\n\nThe proofs might be put into the press\u2014and I shall try to reach early in the day\u2014Make my / thanks and apologies to the kind Madame but after all the trouble I have given her I cannot make use of all her attention\u2014\n\nas to thanking your Father and yourself of course I don\u2019t suppose I shall ever be able to do that.  \n\nGoodnight  \n[signed with a butterfly]  \na very sick butterfly\u2014\n\nHogarth Club,  \n27 Albermarle Street,  \nLondon.  \n[January 1881?]\n\nDo please send to the Pall Mall Gazette Office, Northumberland St\u2014Strand\u2014(to the care of Mr. Charles Morley Editor) a die of the Butterfly\u2014\n\nIf you have one like the one in the World send that\u2014if not send a largish one like what you have on the outside of the Catalogue of the Venice Etchings\u2014Please send it immediately on receipt of this, and put the word immediate on the package.\n\nVery sincerely  \nJ. McN. Whistler.  \n\nHappy New Year to all!!\n\n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C  \nLONDON, February 2nd 1881.  \n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler \u2013\n\nI saw Huish last night who was much shocked at the sad news which I had to convey to him\u2014and desired me to express his sorrow and condolence to you\u2014He also gave me the enclosed which personally is perhaps not unsatisfactory. George Sala has been up and Brown tells me that he seemed delighted with them saying something about a \u201cleader\u201d which would be very nice\u2014\n\nBurnand too has done them / and will show them up in Punch next week\u2014The sales are still going on favourably.\n\nDur\u00e9 assures me that there is no immediate haste for the illustration as he knows not when the article will appear\u2014\n\nBy the bye Huish has asked me to write one for the Art journal\u2014It is a rash thing for an illiterate to attempt\u2014but I have a notion or two which may perhaps be pulled into shape\u2014\n\nMiss Franklin came this morning, of course greatly distressed at the loss you have sustained\u2014and most anxious about you\u2014\n\nShe talked much about your / dear Mother and the character which she drew fills up exactly what I had conceived from frequent study of the portrait\u2014It is indeed a sad deprivation for you\u2014but remember my dear Whistler\u2014that she is not lost but only gone before\u2014\n\nElden has just come in consequence of a Telegram from me\u2014He has been suffering and is so still from cold and lumbago\u2014which prevented his coming on Saturday\u2014Of course I need not tell you how heartily his sympathies are with you both in your success and sorrow\u2014\n\nYou have known him too long to doubt his feelings / although he hides them sometimes not wisely.\n\nGood bye my dear Whistler. Give my kindest regards to your Brother and believe me to be always  \n\nYours faithfull[y]  \nThos Way.\n\n[fig. 3]\n\nARTS CLUB.  \nHANOVER SQUARE.  \nW. [London]  \n[April/May 1881]\n\nMy dear Mr. Morgan\u2014It would never do I think to have the Extracts printed on two sides of a half sheet\u2014Better have a sheet of paper, absolutely the same as the one with my letter\u2014and print the Extracts on the inside\u2014that is on the two pages\u2014so as to fit in the letter, and look like it\u2014[fig. 4]\n\nDo have this done the first thing tomorrow morning\u2014and then the 50 copies will be ready by 12. o\u2019clock\u2014I will call for them\u2014like this\u2014\n\nNow one more thing\u2014/ Have a star put after brother in law\\*\u2014and after best of the two\\*, for foot note\u2014and then below for foot note put\u2014\n\n\\* The Italics are mine.

A. McN. Whistler.\n\n13 Tite Street  \nChelsea. [London]  \n[late October 1882]\n\nMr. Morgan\u2014  \n\nIf not too late I wish one more note added to letter No. XII\u2014page 8, as you will see, marked (f)\n\nThen I should like one sheet of the same paper to enclose the whole as a cover with the title about the middle, as shown on the little note paper enclosed, with the butterfly\u2014the one you have would / do\u2014but I wish you could borrow the one with the sting from the World\u2014You send over to the office with my compliments to Yates or Mr. Escott\u2014Tell them that I want it for something special  \n\nand will send it back in a couple of days\u2014And now dont you think I might have some copies posted to me by tomorrow night?\u2014/  \n\nYours Truly  \nJ.

[London]  \n[February 1883]\n\nDear Mr. Morgan\u2014Just one word about the catalogue\u2014If it be possible the first thing in the morning without retarding the work\u2014see that the marginal note that at present reads \u201cyou can\u2019t always sometimes generally tell\u201d is altered to \u201cSometimes, generally, always!\u201d\u2014  \n\nYours Truly  \nJ. McNeill Whistler\n\n[The Vale, Kings Road] Chelsea [London]  \n8th. Nov.  \n1894. [1885]\n\nMy dear Mr. Way! It is an age since we have been near each other.  \n\nCan you and will you come and dine with us here on Monday next. . . . .\n\nThe Chelsea Omnibus comes right by the entrance of \u201cThe Vale,\u201d which is a private road.\n\nThe place is lovely and you might be in the depth of the country although only half a dozen yards away from the traffic and noise of King\u2019s Road. . . . .The house stands in its own grounds and has a white verandah along the front. Further details when you get inside.  \n\nDinner at 7.30, and I mean it.\n\nThe Vale\u2014Kings Road  \nChelsea\u2014[London]  \n[11 December 1885]\n\nHow could you let the Pall Mall have that shocking old block for the butterfly to my letters Tom?!!!!!\u2014\n\nYou who know how exceedingly particular I am in the careful consideration of every detail in these matters, can well guess how simply apalled I was when I saw in the paper what had happened!! / Mr. Morley says that you told him that the other block is at the \u201cWorld\u201d printing office\u2014and that in the haste that was too far for him to send\u2014but surely you have one also\u2014or how could you have done the \u201cTen O\u2019clock\u201d cover!\u2014  \n\nJ. McN. Whistler.\n\n[The Vale, Kings Road, Chelsea, London]  \n[August 1885 / January 1886]\n\nIf you only knew my dear Way how worked to pieces I have been\u2014and also how, for me, really ill!\u2014\n\nHowever I have always meant to get down to you\u2014and was so sorry to have missed on these occasions!\u2014\n\nAbout this difficulty\u2014I do hope there will really be none\u2014\n\nMr. Chatto was very / nice when he spoke to me about the little hitch\u2014and certainly there is no notion on their part in any way to offend\u2014Their proceedings they say are the usual ones with their own printers, who I think you will admit are not without standing\u2014(Messrs. Spottiswoode,) Surely also it can make no difference whether you print year in and year out for Chatto and Windus or for the rest of the world\u2014your prices and profits for any work would not differ from the known tarif for the same kind of work\u2014and the \u201cRuskin v Whistler\u201d pamphlet was absolutely the same kind of work\u2014and quite as much care and fastidiousness was developed in its production as in our \u201cTen O\u2019clock\u201d.\u2014However as Mr. Chatto says he trusts that you will all understand each other I certainly hope so\u2014for I am charmed with the work done, as I always / am with all that you do\u2013\n\nI shall yet get down to you one of these afternoons\u2014\n\nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n454 Fulham Road\u2014[London]  \nSat.

I hope it will prove satisfactory.\n\nI have also enclosed a small parcel of 3 chalks to be used on this paper. They are extremely hard and brittle, but they have the advantage of not thickening when transferred to stone, as all the other chalks will do from the pressure put upon them and the moisture used. I expect you / will get used to them with the rapidity with which you master everything you touch\u2014they are made expressly for this work. You will be sorry to hear that my father is not at all well just now, so much so as to be unable to attend to business.\n\nMay I ask you to be kind enough to let us have the two pastels back the very beautiful one which you hung lately in Suffolk St. and the figure on the balcony with the white mount? We all miss them so much especially the former. I shall post you proofs of the cover in the morning /  \n\nwith kind regards  \n\nYour\u2019s very sincerely  \nTom. R. Way\n\n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, September 6 1887.\n\nDear Mr. Whistler  \n\nhere is your cover! or at least a proof thereof. Will you please make your suggestions and return it to me at once, that I may have it printed. You will notice that they have put the butterfly wrong way up, I will see it is right before they are printed.  \n\nYour\u2019s sincerely  \nTom. R. Way\n\n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, October 31 1887\n\nDear Mr. Whistler  \n\nI propose coming down to see you at your studio if you will be there tomorrow afternoon, Tuesday, as I have a large roll of old unfinished and blank canvasses to bring you which you might like and we have been clearing out lately, (of course they are all painted by you,) and I want to get another lot of the proofs up to Goupil\u2019s if you can let me have another ten. I should come about 3 pm, So if you won\u2019t be there will you let me know by return here  \n\nYour\u2019s sincerely  \nTom R.

They have not given me any notice before or I should have written to you earlier. Will you let me have the ten sets which you have at the Vale tomorrow? I will come down there first thing in the morning about 10 am and bring the remainder and fetch the others away. They are asking for the whole to be delivered to them / at once. This can be done if you will sign these sets for us.\n\nYour\u2019s very sincerely  \nTom R. Way.\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Decr. 7 1891  \n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI send by bearer two pulls of the rag shop, (not \u201cChelsea\u201d rags but Drury Lane rags!). It is rather bare and thin at present from not having been printed for some time since, in the re-transferring, it will doubtless come fuller and richer. We will have the letterpress added as close to the top right-hand edge as / possible. Will you please say whether the drawing is rightly placed on the sheet? this is the paper and size to be used in the large number.\n\nI also send you an impression from my lithograph of \u201cThe Mother\u201d [see fig. 5].

McN. Whistler.\n\n43 Upper Berkeley St.  \nPortman Square W. [London]  \nJany 27 [18]92  \n\nDear Mrs. Whistler\n\nAs you wished me, I will write the main points I mentioned to you when bringing you the proofs this evening. I told you the following:\u2014that I had had a letter from Goupils to say that Graves threatened to make a claim of \u00a350 in the event of their publishing my lithograph of Mr. Whister\u2019s portrait of his mother\u2014That I interviewed Mr. A. Graves, and that on hearing the whole of the facts connected with the / proposed publication, he voluntarily offered to forego all his rights if we agreed to give him 25 proofs. He declined for the present to give permission to publish the Carlyle\u2014He then explained his reasons for the first demand of \u00a350, and they seemed to be, that he was annoyed at the sale of the picture for reasons I mentioned to you, and also at what seemed to him an attempt to make money out of what was his property, namely the copyright of the picture. He declared that his rights in the three pictures are perfectly clear and straightforward. He also said that / he had bought the three mezzotint plates of the mothers portrait, the Carlyle, and the Rosa Corder from the executrix of Mr. Howell, and that the prints were selling. He was most anxious to have two proofs of one of the prints signed by Mr. Whistler, and hearing that he was in Paris, was anxious to send these proofs over for Mr. Whistler to sign. He asked me if I could get the address for them, and declared that he would wait about the matter of the picture till he could see Mr. Whistler personally on his / return\u2014\n\nI think that is all\u2014and as I told you, I mentioned these matters in no sense as an advocate of Mr. Graves, but simply in the hope of preventing unpleasant consequences, which I thought might possibly occur, and which I also thought the signing of these proofs he asks for might help to prevent.\n\nI remain yours Sincerely  \nTom. R. Way\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, March 4 1892  \n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI have been in consultation with Mr. Thomson this morning about the private view card, and he asked me to have a fresh sketch made and send it direct to you to save time, and to explain what might be necessary. You will see that we have kept the same sized card, and for this reason, that it fits the envelopes of which there are 3000 ready addressed for your Exhibition. Mr. Thomson, however, said that if you liked he would have the press cards printed on a larger sized card, and have fresh envelopes made for them\u2014I have not attempted to put the butterfly on this sketch, will you please put it exactly where you wish it to be\u2014 /\n\nthe proof of the poster will be sent to you tomorrow.\n\nYou will be pleased to hear that the two days sale at Sotheby\u2019s of the great collection of your etchings made by Mr. Hutchingson was finished with great success today.

They arrived too late for insertion in the third Edition but Mr. Thomson expects to be ordering a fourth at the begining of the week. There has been an unfortunate difference of opinion between my father and Mr. Thomson on a mere matter of form; we have never refused to proceed with any orders either from them for themselves or on your behalf, neither have we asked them for any / money, as you might think from his having paid us \u00a320 on your behalf. This having been purely an offer on his part. He however wrote a letter Thursday evening setting matters quite right between us.\n\nHenry says that Messrs. Ballantyne say they have not the particular butterfly by them which you sketched\u2014the one used is the nearest to it.\n\nI have stamped below the two blocks I have used for signing the mothers portrait litho. May I send you some proofs? and would you care to have them in Paris? You are of course entitled to yours for the signing! but apart from / those I should esteem it a great honour if you will accept a few.\n\nWith kind regards to Mrs. Whistler and yourself  \n\nYours very sincerely  \nTom.

Truly! you have had many years of bad usage to live through before it has come, but the success is absolute complete and final. I venture to prophisy that it will not take 10 years after you have left us, to find you represented at Trafalgar Square\u2014and it is my hope that that event may be brought / about whilst you are still with us. Your Catalogue has turned out a financial success too\u2014which is extra satisfactory to us.\n\nYou did not quite understand my last notes, about the litho of \u201cthe mothers portrait\u201d. I dont think it necessary for you to trouble about signing them yourself\u2014I have used the little butterfly stamp, and it looks extremely well; as though you had drawn it with a soft lead pencil. So long as you do not repudiate them, it will be all right. I touch each impression before signing, and have before me the proof you worked on yourself. They are not going / very fast however. The fine photo you have in the Exhibition is selling and taking the wind out of my sails for the moment\u2014\n\nI have just sent some sheets of our transfer paper to Mons. Fantin\u2014for Mr. Wilkin, as I understand you have told him we cannot lay down the French paper. Now I want you to be kind enough to send me a few little pieces of the paper to experiment on myself. Its a different thing, you know, experimenting on one\u2019s own rubbish and risking spoiling such drawings as you have brought us. I am determined to succeed with this colour printing.\n\nWith kindest regards to Mrs. Whistler and yourself  \n\nI remain  \nYours very Sincerely  \nTom. R.

If it is not I must send you some other\u2014but I think the 6 largest pieces will do. Some of the paper is better one side than the other\u2014\n\nI also send / you a few\u2014sheets of the paper\u2014you asked for\u2014but Mr. Whistler says\u2014you are not to let any one have it\u2014or\u2014know\u2014about it\u2014He will give you all the information about it he can\u2014\n\nHe is sending you some cuttings from the French papers\u2014he has had a great success at the Champs de Mars.\n\nWhat about the Leyland sale?

Rue de Tournon. Paris\u2014  \n[22 May 1892]\n\nMy dear Tom. I am most anxious about these sets\u2014I dont half so much want 8 sets of 6, as I do 4 sets of 12\u2014! Or rather what I do want are complete sets\u2014and as many of them as you can get out of the paper I send you\u2014The proofs themselves have not yet arrived but I hope will be here today.\n\nWe are sending you more paper\u2014mind you damp it for printing just as I do for the etchings\u2014I don\u2019t think there will be mildew this time\u2014The last paper was perhaps not chosen with sufficient care\u2014\n\nThe drawings / in the Leyland sale can only be very slight notes on brown paper left by accident at Speke Hall\u2014or given carelessly to the children\u2014with the exception perhaps of the pen and ink of the back view of a lady\u2014This I fancy might be a sketch I did of Mrs. Leyland\u2014but you must be careful\u2014for it was reproduced by photograph\u2014and I don\u2019t remember whether I had the original drawing and this would only be a facsimili\u2014The late Mr. Leyland never bought anything of mine of this kind at all\u2014\n\nWrite me details of all that takes place\u2014and do my dear Tom get me two or three complete sets before the end of next week\u2014You can I am sure print the whole lot as quickly as you could two or three proofs / if you were once started\u2014I have not seen the Fantin yet\u2014They ought to send me that number of The Albemarle.\n\nI was very much troubled when last in Wellington Street\u2014to see all those old destroyed paintings of mine hanging up again in the printing room!\n\nWe had got so nearly through with the matter before. Do please meanwhile take them all down and roll them up and store away until I come over some day soon and then I can carry them off myself\u2014\n\nWrite and tell me you have done this and with my kindest remembrances to your father.  \n\nVery sincerely  \nJ.

I send you a cutting from the Globe, perhaps the authorities may take the hint and act on it, if so we shall perhaps not loose you permanently. / I am also sending to you six copies each of two of the lithographs\u2014the \u201cDrury Lane Rags\u201d seems to have been altogether overlooked and although pulled with those I sent you before, these proofs were not found till long after, the Old Battersea Bridge; we had not paper large enough and I have waited patiently to hear what you thought of the French paper on which I sent you one complete set\u2014I also send you six impressions of my lithograph of which I beg your acceptance / although looking at them, after a long interval, I feel them to be terribly unworthy their subject. They do not make much progress with the sale at Goupils.\n\nYou promissed in your last to give me instructions as to the manner of laying down the transfer paper on the stone, I should be so glad to have them. Are you doing any more colour prints? I think you might do something by the wash process on stone and in colour that would be marvellous\u2014 /\n\nMy father sends you his love and best wishes and with kind regards to Mrs. Whistler and yourself  \n\nI remain  \n\nYours very Sincerely  \nTom R.

I have sent 22 of the cut sheets (some of the remainder was imperfect.) You will find the name and address of our people stamped on the backs of the sheets, but they are only agents for the makers in Germany and we have had the same paper offered us by other people so I have no doubt they have an agent in Paris. I trust we are going to / have the honour of putting on stone the drawings made on this paper\u2014It is not merely in transferring the drawing to stone, but its after manipulation before the impressions are pulled that we have been able to overcome difficulties.\n\nMy father and I are looking to see the portrait lithograph [cat. 60] which you say the master has so kindly promised to send us. It is of course certain that we shall like it as a work of art, and we are looking to see how it is produced from our point of view\u2014 / I send you two prints which I have lately made, a stump drawing on stone from a slight Venetian pastel of the master\u2019s which process he would find most easy in working and sure in result and a reproduction of a figure pastel on brown paper, made with the transfer paper he sent, and done specially to test the possibility of printing in body colours on a dark ground. [fig. 14] I must say that we find that in this subject the black has not been printed strong enough for the great strength of the light colours which have quite gone beyond our / expectations. In the master\u2019s hands most delightful results could be produced.\n\nWith kindest regards from my Father and self to you both  \n\nI remain  \nYours very sincerely  \nTom. R. Way\n\nP.S. of course we saw the letter about the loan of the Carlyle to Chicago or rather the application to loan, and enjoyed it.\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Decr. 15 1892\n\nDear Mrs. Whistler\n\nAbout a fortnight ago I sent to Mr. Whistler a quantity of transfer paper, as you requested in your letter, may I ask if it has arrived safely?\n\nI hope it has, but I write to ask as you mentioned that he was kind enough to say that he was sending an impression of his latest lithograph, the portrait of Stephani\u00e8 Malarme [cat. 60], to my father, and as it has not arrived we are uncertain whether it has / been lost in transit or not yet sent. I have been asked by a gentleman interested in a new art magazine, what Mr. Whistler would be likely to charge for a lithograph similar to the Whirlwind and Albemale drawings but of course to pay for the entire rights. I imagine it would be issued in a similar manner with fine proofs in addition\u2014If you could give me some idea I should be prepared on any future occasion, and could put any likely persons in communication with him.\n\nwith kind regards to you both  \nYours very sincerely  \nTom. R. Way.\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Feby 6th 1893.\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler,  \n\nI am afraid that I can give you but little more information about the Sale than that contained in the priced Catalogue sent with this. Sothebys received the drawings through an Agent and the Owners name has been carefully witheld. But this much I have learned, from gossip in the Sale Room, that they passed, through Dowdeswells\u2019 hands, to a Mr. H. S. Theobold of Lincolns Inn, whose name you may perhaps recognise. / They were mostly slight and struck me as being, \u201cearly studies\u201d (such as the Mummy Cloth and Notes for Dress) \u201cunfinished sketches\u201d or \u201cschemes\u201d for more complete works. As you will see, from the Catalogue, they were mostly bought by the Trade and I do think that had you been in the Room and heard the remarks about them, you would have treated with the contempt it deserved such vulgar rubbish as I regret to hear some paper has been guilty of about you. And is it quite fair, My dear Sir, to put these Fleet St. Litterateurs as representatives of the English Nation? For my part I have been so much in the habit of / finding confident assertions in a first Edition, contradicted in a second whilst the art teaching of the most flourishing Papers is so constantly remarkable only for its ignorance that I have learned to trouble myself very little with their dicta.\n\nI have little more to say except to thank you most heartily for the very gracious manner in which you were good enough to speak of me in your note. Dull as I am, I cannot but feel that what little art knowledge I possess is due to your kindly teaching and influence.\n\nKindest regards from all of us to Mrs. W and yourself  \n\nfaithfully yours  \nT.

Later he wrote: \u201cSeveral stones being made ready, he went to one of his old haunts at Limehouse with my father, and sitting out on a barge made the lithotint of the old wharves and shipping known as \u2018Limehouse\u2019\u201d; Way (1912), pp. 15\u201316. Although there is no evidence that the present letter refers to that occasion, Whistler\u2019s references to wash (tusche) and lithographic ink indicate a period contemporary with his experiments with lithotint in the spring and early summer of 1878.\n\nFGA 164. Single sheet, printed heading, written on one side.\n\nAccording to MacDonald\u2019s classification, the curving lines and veins in the wings of Whistler\u2019s butterfly signature indicate a date between 1878 and 1882; MacDonald (1976), p. 7.\n\nGUL 77. Folded sheet, written on three sides.\n\nDuring the autumn and winter of 1879\u201380, Whistler was staying at the Palazzo Rezzonico on the Grand Canal in Venice, where he was fulfilling a commission from the Fine Art Society for twelve etchings.\n\nThis was the second of two sales following Whistler\u2019s bankruptcy. The first was a furniture sale on 18 September 1879, in which the contents of his house (the White House, Tite Street, Chelsea) were sold; GUL SC 1879.1. The second was conducted by Sotheby\u2019s on 12 February 1880 at 13 Wellington Street, and consisted of items removed from the White House prior to the earlier auction; GUL SC 1880.1 (annotated copy).\n\nLot 81, three etchings, described as a \u201cforge\u201d subject, \u201cBattersea Reach,\u201d and \u201cLady and dog.\u201d The first two were probably The Forge (K 68) and Battersea Reach (K 90). Bought by Howe for \u00a320.10.0; GUL SC 1880.1.\n\nLot 79, quantity of studies in crayon on paper and sixteen photographs. Bought by Huish for \u00a319.10.0; GUL SC 1880.1.\n\nLots 82\u201384, three studies in chalk. Lot 82, described in the sale catalogue as \u201cSarah Bernhardt, seated holding a book,\u201d was A Study of Maud Franklin (M 693; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), bought by Oscar Wilde for 5 gns.; lot 83 was Maud, Reading [Study: Seated Figure], (M 694), bought by Way for \u00a33.7.6; and lot 84 was a nude female figure (M 696; whereabouts unknown), bought by James for \u00a34.0.0; GUL SC 1880.1. Maud, Reading depicted Whistler\u2019s mistress, Maud Franklin. The pose is similar, only in reverse, to the early lithotint Study (cat. 6) of 1878, and may well have been a study for the lithograph.\n\nLot 87, Harmony in Yellow and Gold: The Gold Girl\u2014Connie Gilchrist (YMSM 190; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), was bought by Wilkinson. Lot 88, The Creditor (The Gold Scab) (YMSM 208; The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco), was bought by Dowdeswell. Lot 86 was a terracotta bust of Whistler by Sir J. E. Boehm, bought by Way for 6 gns.; GUL SC 1880.1.\n\nCharles Augustus Howell; H. R. Eldon; and Algernon Bertram Mitford, Baron Redesdale (1837\u20131916). According to Pennell, Eldon was an artist, but little is known of him except that he was amusing company and made himself useful to Whistler; Elizabeth Robins Pennell and Joseph Pennell, The Life of James McNeill Whistler, 5th ed. (Philadelphia, 1911), p. 211. In 1880, after the bankruptcy, he helped to keep track of Whistler\u2019s paintings, but \u201cwent out of his mind and died in an asylum\u201d soon thereafter; Way (1912), p. 12; Young et al. (1980), pp. 135\u201336, no. 243. Mitford was secretary to H.M. Office of Works, 1874\u201386, and had been the second secretary to the British legation in Japan. He wrote Tales of Japan: With Illustrations Drawn and Cut on Wood by Japanese Artists (London, 1871). He married Lady Clementine Gertrude Helen Ogilvy in 1874, and beginning in 1877 lived at Lindsey House, near Whistler. He published several volumes of memoirs.\n\nMarcus Bourne Huish bought eighteen Japanese picture books and fourteen loose drawings (lot 74); about one hundred mostly erased, etched plates by Whistler (lot 78); and a quantity of crayon studies and sixteen photographs (lot 79); see GUL SC 1880.1.\n\nGUL W78. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on three sides. Inscribed, in another hand, on fourth side, Way.\n\nThis referred to a meeting of the committee of examiners with Whistler\u2019s attorney, Sir George Lewis. The three examiners, appointed by Whistler\u2019s creditors at the time of his bankruptcy in May 1879, were Frederick Leyland (see letter 34 n. 121), C. A. Howell, and Thomas Way. The \u201c3 Girls or the pictures at yours\u201d referred to The Three Girls (YMSM 88; whereabouts unknown), commissioned by Leyland and claimed by him (the painting mysteriously disappeared before the auction of Whistler\u2019s bankrupt estate and was never recovered), and other paintings that, according to Whistler, were executed after he had been declared bankrupt and were therefore not to be included as part of his estate. One of these was Pink and Gray: Three Figures (YMSM 89; Tate Gallery, London), a copy of YMSM 88.\n\nWay\u2019s reference to \u201cMy offer for the canvasses etc. accepted\u201d concerned a number of canvases Whistler had \u201cmore or less destroyed\u201d and that had been kept back from the sale; Way (1912), pp. 135\u201336. Way acquired thirty paintings at about this time, including YMSM 74, 82, 93, 109\u201311, 131, 164, 209, 210, and others that remain unidentified. Some, including a \u201clarge roll of old unfinished and blank canvasses\u201d (letter 20), were returned to Whistler in October 1887, but others were still hanging in Way\u2019s printroom in May 1892 (letter 35). The dispute over the ownership of some of these paintings in 1896 contributed to the final rupture between the Ways and Whistler; letter 168 n. 63, letter 169 n. 66; app. IV.14, app. IV.15; Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 1, pp. 258\u201359; Way (1912), pp. 134\u201339. For a full account of The Three Girls and related paintings, as well as of Thomas Way\u2019s acquisitions, see Young et al. (1980), pp. 43\u201344, no. 74, pp. 49\u201353, nos. 87\u201389, p. 69, no. 112.\n\nThere is no evidence that Leyland ever received Pink and Gray: Three Figures from Whistler\u2019s attorney.\n\nGUL W79. Folded sheet, written on four sides.\n\nWhistler was continually short of money while in Venice. According to the original agreement with the Fine Art Society, he was to be paid \u00a3150 to produce twelve etchings within three months, for publication in December 1879. Whistler did not return until November 1880; by that time, the FAS had paid him \u00a3300. The Society had agreed to buy the twelve plates for \u00a3700, but by 20 December 1880, the balance due to Whistler, deducting advances made, was only \u00a3336.13.0; Huish to Whistler, 29 October\u201320 December 1880, GUL F46\u201351.\n\n\u201cDeal\u201d is a British lumber term, generally referring to a pine plank nine inches wide and not more than three inches thick.\n\nThomas Way also supplied Whistler with some Japanese paper for printing his etchings; Whistler wrote to Ernest Faulkner Brown of the Fine Art Society that Way had sent it rolled in a large Christmas issue of The World, and that it had arrived safely and in good condition. Whistler had asked Brown to send him some old Dutch paper, and suggested that he consult Way before sending it, as Way had another idea for safe packaging; Whistler to Brown, [January 1880], GUL LB9/1.\n\nThis may refer to problems with the disposal of Whistler\u2019s bankrupt estate; letter 4.\n\nThe artists Way mentioned exhibited the following pictures at the Grosvenor Gallery in May 1880: P. R. Morris, A.R.A., The Bridge of Sighs (no. 22), Cradled in His Calling (no. 142), The Corner Stone (no. 153); Albert Moore, Jasmine Sprigs (no. 95), Rose Leaves (no. 105), Study for a Figure in Topaz (no. 162); E. Burne-Jones, The Golden Stairs (no. 120); Frank Holl, A.R.A., H. J. Bushby Esq. (no. 134); J. E. Millais, R.A., Mrs. Louise Jopling (no. 49), Portrait of Mrs. Caird (no. 54); E. J. Gregory, Portrait of W. H. Wills, Esq., M.P. (no. 39); Robert W. MacBeth, Landing Sardines at Low Tide (no. 78), Welcome as the Flowers in May (no. 79), Expectation (no. 84), A Flood in the Fens (no. 131), Miss Milly Fisher (no. 133). See Grosvenor Notes 1880, an Illustrated Catalogue of the Summer Exhibition, ed. Henry Blackburn (London, 1880). Thomas Way was a friend of E. J. Gregory; Way (1912), p. 11. Gregory (1850\u20131909) was a watercolorist and genre and portrait painter as well as an illustrator for The Graphic from 1871 to 1875. He was elected A.R.A. in 1883 and R.A. in 1896. Thomas Way owned watercolors and drawings by Burne-Jones, MacBeth, and many other contemporary artists; sale cat., Sotheby\u2019s, London, 25 July 1916.\n\nFGA 83. Two sheets, written on two sides of one sheet. Second sheet inscribed, in another hand, Regent St / Proving of Venice plates / 1881? Although this letter is filed in the Freer Gallery of Art Archives with an envelope inscribed 1881?, it seems to refer to the November 1880 proofing of the first set of twelve Venice etchings, which Whistler was preparing for a December exhibition at the [glossary:Fine Art Society, London].\n\nUpon his return from Venice, Whistler stayed with his brother, who was a doctor of medicine, at 28 Wimpole Street; later he found lodgings at 76 Alderney Street, Pimlico.\n\nT. R. Way assisted with the proofing of Whistler\u2019s first set of twelve Venice etchings. He recorded a vivid and detailed account of his association with the artist when the latter was working in rooms at 65 Regent Street provided by the Fine Art Society. T. R. Way fetched and carried for Whistler, and helped him by damping the old Dutch paper to prepare it for printing, and by carefully pressing the finished proofs; Way (1912), pp. 41\u201348. Whistler was no doubt anxious to keep his new work secret until he was ready to show it at the FAS, and particularly to keep it away from the acquisitive gaze of C. A. Howell, with whom he was no longer on friendly terms. When Howell visited Whistler at Regent Street, the artist apparently refused to let him see his new proofs; Way (1912), p. 48. In 1878 Howell had watched Whistler\u2019s lithographs being printed at Wellington Street and advised T. R. Way to keep proofs; Pennell and Pennell (1921), p. 66.\n\nGUL LB5/95 Copy by Rosalind Birnie Philip. Location of original unknown.\n\nGiven Whistler\u2019s reference to the catalogue of his Venice etchings and to the New Year, this letter probably dates from early January 1881, shortly after the artist\u2019s first exhibition of twelve etchings of Venice at the Fine Art Society in December 1880.\n\nGUL W80. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on four sides.\n\nWhistler was at Hastings, where his mother, Anna Mathilda Whistler (n\u00e9e McNeill) had died on 31 January 1881.\n\nGeorge Augustus Henry Sala (1828\u20131896) contributed regularly to the Daily Telegraph and may have written an item for the paper on Whistler\u2019s Venice pastels. He began his professional career as an illustrator but soon became a regular literary contributor to Household Words and All the Year Round. He also wrote for the Illustrated London News, Illustrated Times, and Cornhill Magazine, and edited The Temple Bar.\n\nSir Francis Cowley Burnand (1836\u20131917), editor of Punch and the author of the article entitled \u201cWhistler\u2019s Wenice; or Pastels by Pastelthwaite,\u201d Punch 80 (12 February 1881), p. 69. Theodore Watts-Dunton wrote to Whistler that the general feeling was that Burnand\u2019s work in Punch was poor; Watts-Dunton to Whistler, [1881], GUL W71. When Whistler, who had had a falling out with Howell, heard that Burnand was ready to fight for Howell\u2019s cause, he advised him to read his Correspondence. Paddon Papers. The Owl and the Cabinet (see letter 11 n. 43), and to ask the opinion of \u201cPellegrine\u201d (Carlo Pellegrini) and Algernon Mitford; Whistler to Burnand, [1881/82], LCPC box 1.\n\nTh\u00e9odore Duret wrote to Whistler that there was no hurry about the article he was writing for the Gazette des beaux-arts, or about the illustration Whistler had promised to provide; Duret to Whistler, 2 February 1881, GUL D190. Duret\u2019s article appeared in April; Th\u00e9odore Duret, \u201cJames Whistler,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts, 2d p\u00e9r., 23 (April 1881), pp. 365\u201369.\n\nAlthough the reviews of the show of Whistler\u2019s etchings at the Fine Art Society were generally derogatory, the anonymous article in The Art Journal was perceptive and generous in its praise. In view of Way\u2019s comment here, it seems likely that he either wrote the review himself, or had been partially responsible for its content; \u201cArt Notes and Reviews,\u201d The Art Journal 33, no. 231 (March 1881), p. 93.\n\nMaud Franklin.\n\nFGA 32. Single sheet, embossed heading, written on two sides; pen-and-ink sketch on first side, by Whistler, of page layout Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 1881?\n\nHenry E. Morgan. Whistler sometimes wrote to Morgan in the absence of Thomas Way or his son, particularly in connection with the publication of groups of letters in the 1880s; see letter 10, letter 11, letter 12, letter 13, and letter 110.\n\nThis concerned the reprinting, under the title Extracts from the Press (a four-page folder), of two articles that appeared in The Cuckoo: A Novelty in Evening Journalism; app. II.4, entries for 30 March\u201316 May 1881, 17 January 1882. The articles were \u201cA Storm in an Aesthetic Teapot,\u201d The Cuckoo 1, no. 28 (12 April 1881), p. 12; and \u201cMr. Whistler and the Painter-Etchers,\u201d The Cuckoo 1, no. 43 (30 April 1881), pp. 10\u201311. These extracts, together with a group of correspondence, were published under the title The Piker Papers. The Painter-Etchers\u2019 Society and Mr. Whistler (London, 1881), later reprinted in Gentle Art, pp. 52\u201365. Piker was a news vendor at Shepherd\u2019s Market who, Whistler thought, had been hired by Seymour Haden to circulate copies of the extract \u201cMr. Whistler and the Painter-Etchers.\u201d The whole affair was about the authorship of some etchings of Venice by Frank Duveneck that had been sent to the First Exhibition of the Painter-Etchers\u2019 Society. Haden (president of the society) assumed Duveneck was a nom de plume for Whistler, and visited Marcus B. Huish, Managing Director of the Fine Art Society. Whistler was under exclusive contract to exhibit his Venice etchings only at the FAS, and viewed Haden\u2019s action as a deliberate slur on his integrity. For details of this incident, see Getscher and Marks (1986), pp. 4\u20135.\n\nFGA 31. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet?), embossed heading, written on two sides of one sheet. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 1881?\n\nWhistler\u2019s letter was to the Committee of the Painter-Etchers\u2019 Society, and the extracts were from The Cuckoo (see letter 9 n. 38). Whistler had received no answer from Sir William Drake, secretary of the Painter-Etchers\u2019 Society, and therefore restated his views to the committee in a letter dated 10 May 1881.\n\nIn a copy of Whistler\u2019s letter to the Committee of the Painter-Etchers\u2019 Society in Glasgow, Whistler has inserted \u201cMethinks\u201d into \u201cHe doth protest too much!\u201d See GUL LB12/53.\n\nFGA 30. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet), written on three sides.\n\nLetter XII, p. 8, a letter from S. Wreford Paddon to Whistler, was one of a collection of letters entitled Correspondence. Paddon Papers. The Owl and the Cabinet, which Way printed for Whistler in 1882; app. II.4, entries for 24 October and 4 November 1882. The correspondence was published and distributed by Whistler to discredit Howell, whom he nicknamed \u201cOwl.\u201d Paddon, a mutual friend of Whistler and Howell, defended the latter\u2019s supposed integrity, and much of the correspondence consisted of Whistler\u2019s attempt to change Paddon\u2019s opinion. In particular, Whistler disclosed Howell\u2019s dishonest business transactions in the sale of Whistler\u2019s nineteenth-century oriental cabinet to the solicitor Sydney Morse; Pennell and Pennell (1921), ill. opp. p. 62. According to a copy of the Correspondence at Glasgow originally owned by C. W. Dowdeswell and dated Decr 1882, an earlier edition had been printed that consisted of only seven pages and had no wrapper; GUL 202a.\n\nEdmund Yates and Thomas Hay Sweet Escott. Yates (1831\u20131894) was the founder of The World: A Journal for Men and Women. Dubbed \u201cAtlas\u201d by Whistler, Yates shared the artist\u2019s penchant for publicity; he documented his feud with W. M. Thackeray in the privately published Mr. Thackeray, Mr. Yates, and the Garrick Club (1859), and in 1884\u201385 served a prison term for libel against the Earl of Lonsdale. Escott (?\u20131924) was the leading writer for the Standard from 1866, and became editor of the Fortnightly Review in 1882. He was a prolific author of biographies and political histories, among them Politics and Letters (1886), Lord Randolph Churchill: A Monograph (1895), and Masters of English Journalism (1911).\n\nFGA 29. Single sheet, written on one side.\n\nProbably Correspondence. Paddon Papers. The Owl and the Cabinet (see letter 11 n. 43), or possibly The Piker Papers. The Painter-Etchers\u2019Society and Mr. Whistler of 1881; see letter 9 n. 38.\n\nWhistler was referring to the tusche or wash used for lithotint, and to lithographic ink, which was commonly used with a pen for writing and for drawing maps. It is not known why he would have wanted these materials in 1882, when he produced no lithotints. Whistler had asked for these same materials in 1878; letter 1.\n\nLCPC box 2. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on one side.\n\nWay printed the catalogue of Whistler\u2019s exhibition Etchings and Drypoints. Venice. Second Series in 1883; app. II.4, entries for 12 February\u201324 April 1883. The alteration was to a marginal comment by Whistler, inserted opposite a quotation from a critic, concerning the Venice etching Traghetto (K 191), no. 37 in the catalogue. The anonymous critic, possibly P. G. Hamerton, had written: \u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s figure drawings, generally defective and always incomplete.\u201d See Gentle Art (1892), p. 101.

From a typed transcription. Location of original unknown. The typed transcript indicates that the original letter, two and a quarter pages long, bore Whistler\u2019s butterfly signature, and was accompanied by an envelope.\n\nThe date on the typed transcript is \u201c8th. Nov. 1894.\u201d However, Whistler was living at 110, rue du Bac, Paris, in 1894. A more accurate date for this letter might be 8 November 1885, the year in which he moved into The Vale, Kings Road, Chelsea; the letter suggests that he had only recently taken up residence there.\n\nFGA 84. Single sheet, written on two sides; addressed envelope. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, Dec 85, and on envelope, Dec 85.  \nAddressed: Ths. Way Junr. / 21. Wellington Street / Strand  \nPostmarked: London / W.C / S.M.P. / AO / DE / 11 / 85\n\nWhistler was referring to a letter published in the Pall Mall Gazette on 10 December 1885, his response to a comment referring to one of his works in the Winter Exhibition of the Society of British Artists that had appeared in the paper on December 8. Beneath a pastel drawing of a nude entitled Note in Violet and Green (M 1074; Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), Whistler had written \u201cHorsley soit qui mal y pense\u201d as a comment on the morality of J. C. Horsley, R.A.; Gentle Art (1892), pp. 193\u201395. The pastel belonged to Thomas Way; letter 18 n. 63; Way (1912), p. 75.\n\nCharles Robert Morley (1853\u20131916) was a journalist and editor of the Pall Mall Gazette. Whistler frequently published letters in The World. A recent one, in February 1885, had been occasioned by Oscar Wilde\u2019s piece for the Pall Mall Gazette on Whistler\u2019s \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture; Gentle Art (1892), pp. 161\u201363; letter 16 n. 56.\n\nLCPC box 3. Two sheets, written on three sides; addressed envelope. Inscribed in pencil, in another hand, on first side, No date.\n\nAddressed: Thomas Way Esq. / 21. Wellington Street / Strand\n\nWay printed the first edition of Mr. Whistler\u2019s \u201cTen O\u2019Clock,\u201d published by Chatto and Windus in 1885. Way\u2019s charges for \u201csetting up\u201d and for frequent revisions of this publication were made out to Whistler, but the account was not paid until twelve years later; app. II.2, entries for 15 August 1885\u201330 January 1886. After this small first edition, there is evidence that Whistler revised the lecture in 1886; a unique bound copy of a corrected version, printed by Way, published by Chatto and Windus, and dated 1886, is at GUL. The discussion here seems to concern Way\u2019s printing charges as compared with those of Spottiswoode and Company of New Street Square, London. The definitive version of Mr. Whistler\u2019s \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d was printed by Spottiswoode (not Way) and published by Chatto and Windus in 1888. Way printed other items for \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d (see app. II.1, app. II.2), including perhaps a pamphlet (a collection of press opinions) entitled Mr. Whistler\u2019s \u201cTen O \u2018Clock.\u201d\u2014as delivered at Prince\u2019s Hall, February 20th, 1885; LCPC box 201. For details about the publication of Whistler\u2019s lecture, see Getscher and Marks (1986), pp. 6\u201313. Spottiswoode and Company printed, and Chatto and Windus published, Whistler\u2019s pamphlet Wilistier vs. Ruskin. Art and Art Critics in 1878 (Getscher and Marks (1986), pp. 1\u20132, mistakenly attributed the printing of this pamphlet to Way). Although Thomas Way was not concerned with this publication, T. R. Way recalled Whistler visiting 21 Wellington Street to read the text of the pamphlet to his father and himself; Way (1912), p. 33\n\nFGA 85. Letter card, written on two sides; addressed envelope. Inscribed, in Whistler\u2019s hand, on verso of envelope, Bring a copy of \u2018Paddon Papers\u2019 / if you have any, and, in another hand, 9 June 1887 / Cox.\n\nAddressed: Tom Way Junr. / 21. Wellington Street / Strand\u2014\n\nWhistler\u2019s script, although not entirely clear, has been transcribed as January rather than June, the month inscribed on the envelope. However, 9 January 1887 was not a Saturday, but a Sunday; the alternative date, June 9, was a Thursday. This suggests that a more accurate date might be 8 January 1887.\n\nTwo albums, originally the property of C. A. Howell, were discovered by Cornelius Cox. They contained a collection of printed matter, including exhibition catalogues, press cuttings, and a copy of the Paddon Papers (see letter 11 n. 43), as well as a number of letters from Whistler to Howell dating from the late 1870s. Cox was a collector of books, prints, watercolors, and Wedgwood china, and was a personal friend of T. R. Way. He told Way that he had been offered the two albums and that they contained letters written by Whistler. Whistler and his brother went to examine the albums and arranged that Cox should bring them to Whistler at Fulham; Way (1912), pp. 77\u201379. According to this letter, the meeting probably took place on the afternoon of 8 January 1887; see n. 58. The Pennells recorded that Cox had paid \u00a314 for them and gave them to Whistler in exchange for etchings; Pennell and Pennell (1921), pp. 66\u201367. The original albums, from which various items have been removed, are in Glasgow; GUL LB11, 12. In 1888 T. R. Way married Amy Ellen Cox, the daughter of Cornelius Cox.\n\nThis probably refers to a publisher for Whistler\u2019s early lithographs. The portfolio Notes was published by Boussod, Valadon, and Co. in London in 1887; letter 20 n. 68; and cat. 7, cat. 8, cat. 14, cat. 15, cat. 17, and cat. 18.\n\nGUL W83. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on three sides.\n\nThe supply of a block of transfer paper and three hard lithographic crayons heralded Whistler\u2019s return to lithography. Using these materials he drew three subjects in 1887: Entrance Gate (cat. 20), Churchyard (cat. 21), and Little Court, Cloth Fair (cat. 22); Way (1912), pp. 88\u201389.\n\nThe pastel \u201chung lately in Suffolk St.\u201d was The Purple Cap (M 1074), a work Thomas Way had bought from the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Bond Street some ten years earlier; Way (1912), p. 3. Whistler exhibited it as Note in Violet and Green in the Winter Exhibition of the Society of British Artists in 1885\u201386, and it was the subject to which he had appended his rebuke to J. C. Horsley; Way (1912), p. 75; letter 15 n. 53. The second pastel was Niobe (M 1077), retitled Annabel Lee by Whistler late in his life. According to T. R. Way, it had been damaged by the frame makers and Whistler then \u201cadded greatly to its brilliance, although he kept it so long that we never hoped to get it back again!\u201d See Way (1912), p. 98. Both subjects (now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) were loaned to the Whistler Memorial Exhibition in 1905 by Thomas Way and bought by Charles Lang Freer later the same year. Pennell wished to reproduce them in a deluxe catalogue; Way to Pennell, 9 March 1905, LCPC box 302.\n\nGUL W84.

In 1885 Boussod, Valadon, and Co. were recorded at this address. In 1888, 116\u201317 New Bond Street was occupied by the Goupil Gallery, Boussod, Valadon, and Co. In November 1887 Boussod, Valadon, and Co. published Whistler\u2019s Notes (cat. 7, cat. 8, cat. 14, cat. 15, cat. 17, and cat. 18). Regarding the sales of Notes, see letter 152; Way (1905), pp. 16\u201317; and Way (1912), p. 87.

This enabled Whistler to retain the primary stone (with the original transferred drawing) for his own proofs; see letter 53, letter 60, and letter 78.\n\nWay was preparing one of Whistler\u2019s lithographs for publication in the new periodical The Albemarle. It seems likely that either T. R. Way was mistaken in the choice of subject or Whistler was not happy with the proofs of Drury Lane Rags (cat. 25), for the latter was not published; instead, Chelsea Rags (cat. 26) appeared in the first issue in January 1892.\n\nT.

Way\u2019s lithographic reproduction of Whistler\u2019s painting of his mother (YMSM 101; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris) was published by Boussod, Valadon, and Co., and was for sale at the Goupil Gallery, where Whistler\u2019s retrospective exhibition, \u201cNocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces,\u201d was held during March and April 1892. The painting had been bought for the French nation in November 1891, to hang in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, and was therefore unavailable for the Goupil exhibition; instead, a photograph of the painting was exhibited in the gallery. T. R. Way\u2019s lithographs of the picture were stamped with a small butterfly signature as a sign of the artist\u2019s approval (letter 31); but according to Way, they did not sell well due to the competition of the fine photograph that was also for sale (letter 33 and letter 36). See Nigel Thorp, \u201cStudies in Black and White: Whistler\u2019s Photographs in Glasgow University Library,\u201d in [glossary:Fine 1987], pp. 85\u2013100. According to D. C. Thomson, only ten of Way\u2019s lithographs were sold at the time of the exhibition; Thomson to Whistler, 14 April 1892, GUL T68.\n\nWhistler\u2019s Mother portrait was one of three paintings reproduced as mezzotint engravings by Richard Josey and published by H. Graves and Co. The others were Arrangement in Gray and Black, No. 2: Portrait of Thomas Carlyle (YMSM 137; City Art Gallery, Glasgow), and Arrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder (YMSM 203; The Frick Collection, New York). Howell bought the copyrights to these pictures from Whistler in 1878 and 1879; on Howell\u2019s death, Graves bought the copyrights from Howell\u2019s executrix. In Graves\u2019s opinion, therefore, T. R. Way\u2019s reproduction of the Mother portrait was an infringement on his copyright. With Howell\u2019s help, Whistler had pawned these three paintings and two nocturnes, Nocturne: Black and Gold\u2013The Fire Wheel (YMSM 169; Tate Gallery, London) and Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket (YMSM 170; Detroit Institute of Arts), to Graves in order to raise money to pay his debts in 1878, and did not redeem them until many years later; Young et al.

C. Thomson, manager of the gallery, had sent Whistler invitation cards printed by Houghton and Gunn for him to compare with those printed by Way, but said that Way would be upset if he were not allowed to print them; Thomson to Whistler, 27 February 1892, GUL T35. Way redesigned the card and Thomson forwarded a sample to Whistler on March 1; Thomson to Whistler, 1 March 1892, GUL T37. On March 4 Thomson confirmed the information in Way\u2019s letter to Whistler of the same date; Thomson to Whistler, 4 March 1892, GUL T40; specimen of invitation card with cut-out butterfly placed in position, GUL T41.\n\nThomas Way also printed the exhibition poster. He had made one before Whistler\u2019s designs had arrived, but Thomson wrote that Way was now changing it according to Whistler\u2019s wishes; Thomson to Whistler, 4 March 1892, GUL T40. The next day Thomson sent Whistler a pull of Way\u2019s poster; Thomson to Whistler, 5 March 1892, GUL T42.\n\nThe sale of the collection of engravings and etchings of the late Joshua H. Hutchinson included a fine and almost complete set of Whistler\u2019s etchings; sale cat., Sotheby\u2019s, London, 3\u20134 March 1892.\n\nThomas Way bought eleven etchings. The other main buyers were London dealers Robert Dunthorne and Deprez and Gutekunst; New York dealer Frederick Keppel; and the Fine Art Society.

Although this was a retrospective of his best paintings, according to Way, \u201cthere were a few, I think about six, lithographs shown upon a screen\u201d; Way (1912), p. 97. The Illustrated London News, however, quoted Whistler as saying that the exhibition was not representative of his work because \u201chere there are no etchings, no lithographs, no water-colours, no pastels; without examples of these no exhibition could be said to represent my work\u201d; \u201cA Gossip at Goupil\u2019s: Mr. Whistler on His Works,\u201d Illustrated London News, 26 March 1892, p. 384.\n\nThomas Way printed the exhibition catalogue Nocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces; Way (1912), pp. 99\u2013100.

Due to last-minute corrections, members of the press were kept waiting for the catalogues until 4:30 P.M.; Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, p. 126\n\nThese errors appeared in the second edition of the catalogue; GUL EC 1892.2. In the corrected version, \u201cby\u201d was included on the title page and \u201cIllustrated London News\u201d was inserted on page 29. \u201cHall and Park,\u201d however, had not been changed to \u201cHolland Park\u201d; GUL EC 1892.3. These copies were to be given away at the private viewing and sold afterward for one shilling each; Thomson to Whistler, 18 March 1892, GUL T49. Altogether there were five separate printings, and 3,750 catalogues were disposed of between 21 March and 9 April 1892. Thomas Way was paid \u00a333.19.3, and \u00a375 was paid into Drummonds, Whistler\u2019s bank, leaving a sum of \u00a313.19.0 still due to Whistler. For detailed documentation of the business transactions, see Thomson\u2019s letters to Whistler, 18 March\u201323 April 1892, GUL T49\u201375.\n\nThis was the first edition of the catalogue, destroyed on March 19. However, six copies were preserved and the brown paper covers of the rest carefully removed and used for the second edition; a complete copy of the first edition, annotated by Whistler, together with a typed explanatory note, is preserved at GUL; GUL EC 1892.1; see also Way (1912), p. 100.\n\nJ.

When more copies were ordered by Goupil\u2019s, who wished to pay for them COD, Thomas Way refused to sign receipts made out on behalf of Whistler because the new order had been made by the gallery and not by Whistler; Thomson to Whistler, 30 March 1892, GUL T56. On March 31 the gallery received 500 catalogues and gave Way a check, but Way sent his lawyers to discuss the matter; Thomson to Whistler, 31 March 1892, GUL T57. Way\u2019s account for \u00a333.19.3 was paid by Goupil\u2019s, and Way later charged for the 250 catalogues that had been destroyed on the day of the private viewing; Thomson to Whistler, 14 and 22 April 1892, GUL T68, T74; letter 30 n. 100.\n\nHenry E.

One was entitled \u201cA Zealous Inquirer;\u201d and was taken from The World (23 March 1892); the other was a reply by Whistler entitled \u201cFinal Acknowledgements,\u201d also published in The World (30 March 1892). When these were included in the second edition of The Gentle Art of Making Enemies, Whistler changed the last correction from \u201cdainty purpose\u201d to \u201cwicked purpose\u201d; Gentle Art, pp. 332\u201334.\n\nJ.

That same year the painting was transferred to the Tate Gallery. In subsequent years many other important works, including Harmony in Gray and Green: Miss Cicely Alexander (YMSM 129), Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl (YMSM 52), and Nocturne: Blue and Silver\u2013Chelsea (YMSM 103), were given to the National Gallery by their owners and later transferred to the Tate Gallery.\n\nSee letter 26 n. 82.\n\nT. R. Way sent some of the grained German transfer paper (papier viennois) to Fantin-Latour, who was to contribute an original lithograph to The Albemarle; W. H. Wilkins and Hubert Crackanthorpe were editors of the periodical. Fantin-Latour\u2019s lithograph A Portrait appeared in the June issue. Whistler had visited the French artist in Paris, where he had learned about a different kind of transfer paper. He wrote from Paris to Beatrix in London: \u201cI have bought nearly three pounds worth of the most wonderful transparent lithograph paper! such as old Way never dreamed of!\u2014and such as I suppose I should never have seen in London\u201d; Whistler to Beatrix Whistler, [June 1891], GUL W587. Way received some of this paper in May 1892, as requested, with the promise of further information, but he was still waiting for instructions from Whistler on how to transfer it to the stone as late as September 1892; letter 34 and letter 36. Nevertheless, Way made several experiments using grained transfer paper and the smooth French transfer paper, both in black and white and in color, and sent these to Whistler in Paris; see letter 39 n. 147, n. 148. Whistler probably used a similar transparent transfer paper for St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 60) in November 1892 and for his lithographs of 1894 in Paris; see letter 38 n. 143 and letter 104.\n\nWhistler\u2019s first experiment in color lithography was made with Thomas Way in November 1890, when he produced Figure Study in Colors (cat. 39); Way (1912), pp. 90\u201391; app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 27 November 1890. In November 1892 T. R. Way sent Whistler the results of his own experiments, in which he had reproduced some of the artist\u2019s pastel drawings; see letter 39 nn. n. 147, n. 148.\n\nFGA 91.

Leyland (1831\u20131892) had founded the Leyland shipping line in 1873. He was a collector of Renaissance art and a patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, Albert Moore, and Whistler. In 1867 he bought Speke Hall in Liverpool, where he frequently entertained Whistler. During the next ten years Leyland was Whistler\u2019s chief patron, and many of the artist\u2019s portraits of members of the Leyland family\u2014in virtually all media\u2014rank among his finest works. Whistler\u2019s last work for Leyland was the decoration of the dining room of the latter\u2019s London house\u2014later known as the Peacock Room. A disagreement over Whistler\u2019s fee precipitated a quarrel that ended their relationship. Leyland was one of Whistler\u2019s major creditors at the time of his bankruptcy in 1879; see letter 4 and Whistler-Leyland correspondence, GUL.

According to the annotated list letter (34), Way printed six each of thirteen only, and of the sixty sheets received twelve were rejected. Copies of Drury Lane Rags (cat. 25) and Old Battersea Bridge (cat. 18) were forwarded in September; letter 36.\n\nWhistler had evidently received a letter (now missing) from Way complaining about mildewed paper he had had to reject from the last batch.\n\nT.

He bought 110, rue du Bac and acquired a studio at 186, rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs. For a description of the apartment and studio, see Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, pp. 137\u201338. Whistler remained in Paris until December 1894, when his wife\u2019s illness forced him to return to England. In the hope that Beatrix was recovering, Whistler took up residence in Paris again in the spring of 1895, only to return to England in September, where he stayed until his wife\u2019s death in May 1896.\n\nSee letter 26 n. 82.\n\nSee letter 33 n. 114.\n\nSee letter 33 n. 115. Whistler\u2019s activity as a color lithographer during the early 1890s was undertaken in association with William Heinemann for the publication of the series \u201cSongs on Stone.\u201d He worked on this project with the French printer Belfond at the rue Gaillon in Paris between October 1891 and the late summer of 1893. Whistler\u2019s correspondence with Beatrix, Heinemann, and Mallarm\u00e9 during this period occasionally referred to his work in color lithography. Whistler made six color lithographs with Belfond (cat. 45, cat. 46, cat. 55, cat. 56, cat. 66, and cat. 67), but they were not published or editioned, and the collaboration was brought to an end when the artist quarreled with the printer in late 1893; see letter 53.

Regarding Way\u2019s lithograph after Whistler\u2019s portrait of his mother, see letter 26 n. 82.\n\n\u201cFrench paper\u201d refers to the printing paper mentioned by Way in letter 36. \u201cOld government ends\u201d may refer to a paper once used and perhaps manufactured for the French government, but no longer required or suitable for the purpose for which it had originally been intended.\n\nWhistler made a series of etched views of Paris beginning in the summer of 1892, subjects to which he would return in his Paris lithographs of 1893\u201394; Lochnan (1984), pp. 260\u201365.\n\nHarry Quilter (1851\u20131907) was the art critic for the Times and The Spectator and author of Sententiae Artis (1886), Preferences in Art, Life, and Literature (1892), and numerous other works, including contributions to a variety of periodicals, such as Nineteenth Century, Contemporary Review, and National Review. He bought Whistler\u2019s White House in Chelsea in September 1879 for \u00a32,700. In 1886 Quilter applied, unsuccessfully, for the Slade Chair of Art at Cambridge University. When Whistler, who always referred to Quilter as \u201c\u2019Arry,\u201d heard about the application, he wrote a witty letter to The World (24 March 1886); Gentle Art, pp. 121\u201323. This was only one of many attacks he made on Quilter and other critics, including Philip Gilbert Hamerton, Thomas Taylor, and Frederick Wedmore. Such published correspondence was first brought together in The Gentle Art of Making Enemies (London, 1890).\n\nWhistler exhibited six paintings at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and was awarded a gold medal. The letter he refers to here was a refusal to accept the Royal Commission\u2019s invitation to exhibit Arrangement in Gray and Black, No. 2: Portrait of Thomas Carlyle (YMSM 137; City Art Gallery, Glasgow), which had been previously \u201cskied,\u201d or hung above the line of vision, at the Victorian Exhibition at the New Gallery. Whistler wrote to J. W. Beck, who was the secretary of the Fine Arts Committee for Chicago and who had also been the secretary of the New Gallery, London, to the effect that Whistler was \u201conce hung twice shy.\u201d When this was published in the National Observer, a printing error changed it to \u201conce hung twice sky.\u201d Whistler exhibited independently of the British section but did not show the Carlyle portrait. See Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, pp. 130\u201332; Society of Arts to Whistler, 13 July 1892, GUL LB1/32; Whistler to Society of Arts, [July 1892], GUL B1/33.\n\nFGA 94. Folded sheet, written on three sides.\n\nCat. 60 was drawn on thin, transparent transfer paper, probably of the type Fantin-Latour had recommended to Whistler (see letter 33 n. 114). The portrait was used as a frontispiece to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s Vers et Prose (Paris, 1893). See Way (1912), p. 105; Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, pp. 134\u201335.\n\nGUL W94. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on four sides.\n\nWay recorded sending \u201c23 pieces grained transfer paper\u201d to Paris on 28 November 1892; app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 28 November 1892. This was the order requested by Whistler; letter 38. Way probably bought it from Gilby and Herrmann at 9\u201311 Garrick Street, Covent Garden, only a few steps from 21 Wellington Street; see letter 43 n. 162. Since Way did not record sending Whistler more transfer paper in 1893\u201394, Whistler probably acquired his supply through retailers in Paris or from the Lemercier shop at 57, rue de Seine, as he did another type of transfer paper made for pen-and-ink work; see letter 44 n. 170. Belfond supplied transfer paper to Whistler for his color work in Paris; three similar sheets of transparent transfer paper, with Whistler\u2019s designs on them (drawn in ink and lithographic crayon), are marked with Belfond\u2019s blind stamp (dwg. III, dwg. V, and dwg. VI).\n\nSee letter 38.\n\nThis was probably Venice Nightfall, also entitled Salute Dawn (HAG, McCallum Collection, Add 1662). A black-and-white lithograph with no sign of a transfer paper grain, it has soft, melting tones suggestive of stump on stone. The subject cannot, however, be readily identified with any of the Venetian pastels Whistler exhibited at the Fine Art Society in 1881, and so may have been a subject rejected for the exhibition and possibly bought by Thomas Way from Whistler. Way bought a number of Whistler\u2019s Venice pastels, including Salute\u2014Sundown (M 809; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow), no. 48 in the 1881 exhibition catalogue, of which T. R. Way made a color lithograph entitled Sunset: Venice (Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, McCallum Collection, Add 1658). This was drawn on the coarse-grained transfer paper papier viennois, and was published in The Studio 30, no. 129 (December 1903). See letter 72 n. 103.\n\nThis lithograph is difficult to identify with certainty, but is probably The Purple Cap (Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, McCallum Collection, Add 1991); see The Studio 33, no. 139 (October 1904). This image of a draped female, printed on brown paper, has no suggestion of a mechanical grain, and so Way could have employed the smooth French paper Whistler had sent to him; see letter 33 n. 114. Whistler\u2019s pastel The Purple Cap (M 1074; Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) had been bought by Thomas Way about 1877 and was later acquired by Charles Lang Freer; Way (1912), p. 3. If T. R. Way did make a lithographic reproduction of this pastel in 1892, when the result was not completely satisfactory, he could have reprinted or redrawn it years later for publication in The Studio.\n\nSee letter 37 n. 141.\n\nGUL W95. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on two sides.\n\nSee letter 39.\n\nSee letter 38.\n\nProbably Gleeson White, editor of The Studio, a periodical that first appeared in April 1893. The offices of The Studio were at 16 (later 5) Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, just around the corner from Thomas Way\u2019s shop. Whistler had published lithographs in The Whirlwind and The Albemarle in 1890 and 1892 (cat. 26, cat. 34, cat. 36, and cat. 37).\n\nGUL W96. Folded sheet, printed heading, written on three sides.\n\nEighteen drawings by Whistler were sold at Sotheby\u2019s on 23 January 1893. They were bought by Robert Dunthorne, Marcus B. Huish of the Fine Art Society, E. F. J. Deprez of Deprez and Gutekunst, Mrs. Noseda, a London print dealer, and Thomas Way; GUL SC 1893.2 (annotated copy).\n\nH. S. Theobald, K.C., lived at Westbourne Square, W.2. He owned many drawings, pastels, etchings, and oils by Whistler, most of which he had bought through Dowdeswells\u2019; Young et al. (1980), p. 146, no. 280. Whistler visited him from time to time to see the collection and sometimes to borrow pictures for exhibition; Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, pp. 128\u201329.\n\nThe relevant letter from Whistler to Way appears to be missing.\n\nFGA 96. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet), written on four sides; addressed envelope. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 12 Sep 93.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas Way, Junr. / 21.

DU BAC / 5E / 12 / SEPT / 93 and LONDON / W.C. / C.X. / BA / SP / 13 / 93\n\nWay\u2019s letter to Whistler is apparently missing. Whistler and his wife spent July and August in Brittany visiting Vitr\u00e9, Lannion, Paimpol, Perros Guirec, and the C\u00f4tes-du-Nord. Although Whistler mentioned only \u201cthree drawings,\u201d T. R. Way proofed and catalogued five lithographs from the Brittany trip: The Fireplace (cat. 61), The Marketplace, Vitr\u00e9 (cat. 62), Vitr\u00e9: The Canal (cat. 63), Gabled Roofs (cat. 64), and The Clock-Makers, Paimpol (cat. 65); app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 19 September 1893. Whistler asked for The Fireplace to be destroyed; letter 44. To the above may be added two color lithographs the artist worked on with Belfond in 1893, Red House, Paimpol (cat. 66) and Yellow House, Lannion (cat. 67). While in Brittany, Whistler also painted several seascapes (YMSM 409, 411, 412, 414), some of which were shown at the Grafton Gallery, London, in 1894, and Whistler recommended that Way visit the exhibition; letter 77.\n\nT. R. Way gave a lecture and demonstration of lithography on 5 May 1893 for the Art Workers\u2019 Guild at Barnard\u2019s Inn Hall. He set up a press, pulled impressions from two of Whistler\u2019s stones, and provided an exhibition that included prints by Whistler; Way (1912), pp. 101\u201302; see cat. 18 and cat. 34. According to Pennell, the enthusiasm sparked by Way\u2019s lecture and exhibition resulted in several members, then and there, making drawings on stone for a portfolio of lithographs. Among the contributors were Frederick Goulding, W.R. Lethaby, George McCulloch, H. M. Paget, Joseph Pennell, and Frank Short; Pennell and Pennell (1915), p. 133. The Pennells\u2019 1921 account of the evening, however, implied that the audience did not think highly of the lithographs from Whistler\u2019s stones that Way distributed; Pennell and Pennell (1921), p. 251.\n\nFGA 95. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet), written on one side of each sheet; addressed envelope. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 14 Sep 93.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas Way / 21. Wellington Street / Strand / London / Angleterre  \nPostmarked: PARIS / 80 / R. DU BAC / 5E / 13 / SEPT / 93 and LONDON / W.C. / C.X. / BA / SP / 14 / 93\n\nT. R. Way had supplied Whistler with some hard lithographic crayons in 1887 to use with the German transfer paper; letter 18 n. 62; Way (1912), pp. 88\u201389. In the 1880s Way probably bought his lithographic supplies from Zorn, Bahnson, and Co. at 9\u201311 Garrick Street, Covent Garden (later Gilby and Herrmann at the same address; see letter 39 n. 145), and Whistler may have associated this name with lithographic crayons, or confused it with Korn\u2019s lithographic crayons, manufactured by William Korn, Inc., New York, and recommended by Pennell; Pennell and Pennell (1915), pp. 253\u201354. Whistler referred to using German chalks and French no. 2 in July 1894 (letter 89), no. 3 in August 1894 (letter 107), and nos. 2 and 3 when in London in January 1896 (letter 164). In the Whistler Collection at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, there are two boxes of Lemercier crayons no. 3 and one box no. 2, one empty box of crayon estompe, and one box of Gilby and Herrmann crayons for grained transfer paper.\n\nWhistler used the stump for his lithographs of Brittany, but also for his Paris pastels of the 1890s, in which he achieved a uniquely rich, jewel-like quality. He possessed a large number of stumping pencils, fourteen of them made with rolled paper; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, Whistler Collection; see letter 48 n. 181.\n\nNormal crayons were too hard to use with the stump directly; Whistler needed rubbing ink stick, or crayon estompe. The \u201cpiece of stuff\u201d referred to in letter 44 was probably a block of rubbing ink stick.\n\nProbably Red House, Paimpol (cat. 66); see letter 45.\n\nFGA 97. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet), written on three sides; addressed envelope. Inscribed, in Whistler\u2019s hand, on verso of envelope, Wet the proof I send you and press / just like an etching\u2014. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 17 Sep 93.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas Way Jnr. / 21 Wellington Street / Strand / London / Angleterre  \nPostmarked: PARIS / 80 / R. DU BAC / [ ] / 17 / SEPT / 93 and LONDON / [ ]\n\nSee letter 43 n. 162.\n\nThe Fireplace (cat. 61); see letter 42 n. 159. Whistler had already received proofs of the Brittany subjects and was waiting for new proofs on Dutch paper. The latter were recorded by Thomas Way in his account to Whistler for 19 September 1893, but there is no record of any earlier proofs; see app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 19 September 1893. Way probably received the Brittany drawings on September 13 (Whistler sent them on September 12; letter 42) and would have transferred and printed them on September 13 or 14. Since Whistler\u2019s letter to Way referring to the proofs was posted on a Sunday, September 17, Way\u2019s proofs had probably arrived on Saturday, September 16.\n\nSee letter 42.\n\nThis French transfer paper may have been a type called papier bristol chine glac\u00e9 pour la plume, which had a smooth, glazed surface and was made specifically for drawing with pen. Whistler later referred to the French paper he had found as being \u201cintended for pen and ink work\u201d; letter 51. He may have obtained it through Duch\u00e2tel, Lemercier\u2019s artistic printer, who was familiar with the wide range of transfer papers available and had fully described and illustrated their use in his treatise of 1893 [\u201cWhistler\u2019s Lithographic techniques,\u201d (fig. 9 and fig. 10)]; Duch\u00e2tel (1893), pp. 32\u201349; and letter 39 n. 145.\n\nFGA 98.

Proofs of The Fireplace (cat. 61), which Whistler had asked Way to destroy, may also have been included; letter 44; see app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 19 September 1893.\n\nProbably Red House, Paimpol (cat. 66); see letter 43 n. 165.\n\nFGA 99.

He was encouraged to use the technique by T. R. Way, who sent the results of his own experiment with the stump to Whistler in 1892; see letter 39 n. 147. Way was familiar with the history of the technique, for he referred to the work of James Duffield Harding in an article for The Studio in 1894; Rothenstein and Way (1894), p. 18. For other historical and technical references to particular artists, see Way and Dennis (1903), pp. 78, 81.\n\nFGA 102.

It was composed of grease particles suspended in water or dissolved in other solutions and was designed to give the effect of watercolor both in its range of tone and in its spontaneous brushwork. In November Whistler wanted to use the wash process again, and wrote to Way asking for a \u201clump of ink\u201d and \u201cbottles of mixture\u201d; letter 61. For Way\u2019s reply, see letter 62 and letter 64.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\"> fig. 1 Study, Seated Figure, 1878 (M 694). Chalk on brown paper; 312 \u00d7 194 mm.
