The first (cat. 151) was left unfinished and was canceled by the artist. The second was this drawing, which, according to T. R. Way\u2019s memoir of 1912, was completed but failed to satisfy Whistler. The third attempt yielded the portrait judged by the artist to be the most successful (cat. 153). As was his usual practice, the artist numbered the two completed portraits in the order of his preference. Despite the confusion sometimes caused by Whistler\u2019s numbering, there is no doubt that Study No. 2 was executed prior to Study No. 1. T. R. Way clarified the order in which the portraits were drawn in his article of 1913 for The Print-Collector\u2019s Quarterly: \u201cThe Study No. 1, the portrait of Mr. Thomas Way, was the third attempt, the earlier ones being cast aside rather than any alteration tried.\u201d Way also inscribed a signed impression of Study No. 2 (now in The Art Institute of Chicago, 1917.634) with the notation no. 108 drawn before 107 and discarded.\n\nThe elder Way\u2019s stance is almost identical in all three of Whistler\u2019s lithographic studies, and also in a graphite drawing that may have served as a preparatory study for the prints (fig. 152a [M 1453]). However, in Study No. 2 the printer seems to rest more weight on his right foot, and the cast shadow that falls to both his left and right is larger in relation to the figure than in Study No. 1. According to T. R. Way\u2019s 1912 account, the portraits of his father were drawn late in the day by the light of a gas stove. His detailed description of the circumstances (see also cat. 151) includes the following passage: \u201cIt was a winter\u2019s afternoon, and I was in the inner room with my father, and at work myself, and did not notice how the daylight was failing; but at last it dawned upon me, and I went to Whistler to light the gas for him. There I realised the position, for the bright light of the stove in the inner room had filled it. \u2018Why, Mr. Whistler, you have no light\u2014you cannot see\u2014you are drawing by feeling!\u2019 Almost, Tom, almost!\u2019 was his answer, and it was literally true.\u201d\n\nThe Way portraits were probably executed in January or February 1896, when Whistler was much occupied in drawing and revising lithographs and would therefore have been making regular visits to the Way printing offices. Only a few months later, in the early summer, the artist\u2019s relationship with his printers grew strained and their long collaboration came to an end. When Whistler died, there were no impressions of any of the Way portraits in his possession.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (295 \u00d7 212 mm), inscribed, in T. R.
