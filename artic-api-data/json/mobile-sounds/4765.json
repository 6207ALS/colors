    "transcript": "<p>In Hawaiian Sun</p>\n<p>There is a lei hanging loosely round your mother\u2019s neck, the petals green wings fluttering flightlessly,<br>as a gale trots down the Hawaiian shore.</p>\n<p>Ask her to kneel there in the sand.</p>\n<p>Take the lei from her neck;<br>I will untie the knots of these flower stems and lay them out behind you<br>that you may burst from this greenness and return life to us as it gives life to you,</p>\n<p>as you loosely cross your large, long arms as if to catch my falling words,</p>\n<p>as you lean forward, your ears swollen and silent with listening,</p>\n<p>as you are brown like fallow soil, like wooden chairs in midafternoon, like palmate fronds as they reach toward the sky here in Hawaiian sun.</p>\n",
