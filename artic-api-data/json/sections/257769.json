T. R. Way (1912) recalled that Early Morning (cat. 9) and The Toilet (cat. 10) had already been drawn and proved when Whistler set to work on the two bridge subjects. Nevertheless, The Broad Bridge was the first \u201cNote\u201d to be included in the periodical because its editor, Theodore Watts-Dunton, and the \u201ctwo ladies\u201d who funded the magazine believed that circulation would be boosted by the inclusion of \u201ca landscape, more after the manner of the etchings which the public already admired.\u201d They no doubt hoped to capitalize on the favorable reception of Whistler\u2019s earlier detailed etchings of Thames subjects. Despite this strategy, Piccadilly went out of business two weeks later; Early Morning and The Tall Bridge were never published. The inside front cover of the 4 July 1878 issue of Piccadilly announced The Broad Bridge as the first of Whistler\u2019s \u201cNotes in Black and White,\u201d and stated that \u201ca limited number of Proofs of Mr. Whistler\u2019s \u2018Notes in Black and White\u2019 will be pulled on Japanese paper, and may be obtained at Piccadilly Office, Wine Office Court, Fleet Street.\u201d\n\nAccording to T. R. Way\u2019s account of 1912, Whistler began work on the two bridge lithographs by making a pair of drawings of Old Battersea Bridge in black chalk with white-chalk heightening on brown paper (fig. 11a [M 700] and fig. 11b [M 701]), both now in American private collections. He took these to the Ways\u2019 printing offices on Wellington Street, where he \u201cdrew them both on a fresh stone.\u201d Although Way failed to describe the process by which the drawings were transferred to stone, it is possible to reconstruct the procedure based on examination of the drawings themselves. Tracings made from the two lithographs, when reversed, line up very closely with the corresponding chalk drawings. This indicates that rather than copying the drawings freehand, Whistler used a transfer or tracing process to put his compositions on stone.\n\nSince the preliminary drawings reveal no evidence of a transfer medium on their versos, or pressure from a stylus, it is reasonable to conclude that Whistler wished to protect his drawings and therefore utilized a method that would not mar or destroy them. He may have first traced them with soft pencil onto nearly transparent paper and then interposed a sheet of paper coated on one side with red chalk (or some other transferable medium) between this pencil tracing and the stone. By drawing over the tracing with a stylus or hard pencil, he would then have transferred his image to the stone in red chalk, providing the necessary guidelines for working up the composition with lithographic crayon. The images on the stone would thus have been oriented in the same direction as the drawings on brown paper. A careful comparison between the original drawing for The Broad Bridge and the lithograph reveals that Whistler reworked several areas of the image directly on the stone. The structure of the central pier of the bridge was rendered more three-dimensional, the Chelsea shoreline brought into sharper focus, and the shadowed reflections in the water enhanced.\n\nAfter completing the drawings for the two bridge lithographs on a single stone, Whistler went on to finish the images with brush-and-tusche washes of different strengths. T. R. Way (1912) recalled that his father was absent from the printing offices when the washes were mixed and applied to the stone. Apparently, neither the seventeen-year-old T. R. Way nor Whistler was aware that skilled individual inking and hand pulling were required for such delicate lithographic washes, rather than the automated printing that would be necessary for a large periodical edition. Decades later Way had learned from experience that \u201cworks of this kind should not be attempted, except in such very moderate numbers as will ensure that every proof or print issued will be perfect.\u201d After adding the washes, which range from dark shadows in the wooden piers and rich reflections in the water below the central pier to the palest suggestion of tone in the sky, Whistler delicately scraped away some of the tone in the sky below the bridge span on the left. The irregular borderlines around the image were formed by pooling of the dilute washes that were floated over the image.\n\nImpressions were printed in various brown inks, some on mounted Japanese paper. In some of these mounted impressions, the printed image extends beyond the edges of the primary sheet onto the secondary sheet. The stone bearing The Broad Bridge and The Tall Bridge destabilized rapidly under the rigors of machine printing.\n\nChicago: MWC (2), ivory plate paper (247 \u00d7 357 mm); tan laid paper (195 \u00d7 291 mm). Glasgow: HAG, golden-yellow chine (Japanese paper, 185 \u00d7 276 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (286 \u00d7 448 mm). London: BM, grayish ivory plate paper (261 \u00d7 378 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Battersea Bridge.\n\nRemarks: Other mounted impressions on Japanese paper are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA; Boston, MFA; and Cincinnati, CAM. An extremely rich impression printed in brown ink on a large sheet of proofing paper is found in New Haven, YUAG.\n\nPublished edition. This subject was printed by machine on white plate paper (often discolored to tones of off-white and ivory) and was issued as a supplement to Piccadilly. All known periodical impressions were printed in very dark brown or warm black inks that are significantly darker than those used for proofs outside the edition. Some of the earliest Piccadilly impressions are of fine quality, but most surviving prints are clogged. Subtle areas of wash darkened and became more pronounced, while the washes in the foreground became grainy and uneven. The pooled edges of wash bordering the images became indistinct in some areas. Some impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend.\n\nChicago: AIC, brown ink on ivory plate paper (242 \u00d7 356 mm); Palmer, brown ink on ivory plate paper (259 \u00d7 382 mm); SC, brown ink on off-white plate paper (254 \u00d7 355 mm).
