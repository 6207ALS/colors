More than half of the artist\u2019s total output of sculpture (over eighty works), in fact, dates to between 1900 and 1909, and his artistic development during that time reveals a deep dialogue between two- and three-dimensional explorations of themes. As Matisse himself explained:\n\nI took up sculpture because what interested me in painting was a classification of my ideas. I changed my method and worked in clay in order to have a rest from painting, where I had done all I could for the time being. That is to say that it was done for the purposes of organization, to put order into my feelings and find a style to suit me. When I found it in sculpture, it helped me in my painting. It was always in view of a complete possession of my mind, a sort of hierarchy of my sensations that I kept on working in the hope of finding an ultimate solution.\n\nMatisse\u2019s early training, whether painting in Gustave Moreau\u2019s classroom at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts or sculpting with Emil-Antoine Bourdelle, involved the study of ancient and Old Master works of art. Indeed, the artist found copying works in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre so important that he continued the practice far beyond his formative years (see cat. 24). Even after the 1905 Salon d\u2019Automne, the exhibition that established Matisse among his contemporaries as the \u201cKing of the Fauves,\u201d he found inspiration in a well-known ancient Roman bronze, Spinario (1st century B.C.; fig. 9\u201311.1). He reinterpreted the fixed and balanced original, dramatically compressing its inward-focused, bent-over pose into a sweeping, cantilevered figure with a distinct energy and movement, as if the figure were trying to escape from the weighty mass at its base.\n\nLike many of Matisse\u2019s small figural sculptures of this time, Thorn Extractor is connected to the artist\u2019s fascination with the subject of Arcadia, the imagined setting of much pastoral poetry and a powerful symbol of an idyllic golden age. For the artist and his peers, this paradise could be found in the South of France, in such sun-soaked coastal towns as Saint-Tropez and Collioure, where he traveled to paint in the early 1900s and which provided artistic inspiration for his first major paintings, Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9 (1904\u201305; fig. 9\u201311.2) and Le bonheur de vivre (1905\u201306; fig. 9\u201311.3). In turn, he produced at least seven figures in the round from these canvases, including Woman Leaning on Her Hands. Unlike Thorn Extractor, this work has no base. The immediacy of its presentation is enhanced by Matisse\u2019s method of working the original clay and the traces of his fingers left as he molded the form into shape\u2014indeed, he literally pressed and grounded the figure with so much weight that its hands were nearly flattened; at other points, such as the hip and thigh, the contour is so slight that the woman seems to be rising from the surface as opposed to sitting upon it.\n\nWhile the connections between painting and sculpting were deep for Matisse at this time, only a handful of his sculptures became subjects of paintings themselves. Yet both Thorn Extractor and Woman Leaning on Her Hands are featured in the luminous canvas Still Life with Geranium. The painting is one of contrasts\u2014the pale palette and light brushwork in the upper half of the picture and the darker colored, more heavily painted lower half; the firm, planted pose of the female figure and almost-fleeing stance of the male; and the red root vegetables grown near Paris and the ceramic objects from exotic, faraway places. Most striking, however, is the clear demonstration of what the simultaneous experiences of painting and sculpting offered the artist: the opportunity to describe volume and void, seen and invisible, in different physical ways. Through oil paint layered or scumbled onto the canvas with a brush, Matisse described the power of sunlight to dissolve form, dislocating the geranium\u2019s network of branches and foliage and at the same time producing a sense of weight and substance in the spaces left behind. The two sculptures, which physically record the artist\u2019s working of the clay with his hands, are here represented in outline and light color, in marked contrast to the thickly painted, \u201cimmaterial\u201d gaps in the foliage. The challenges of working in space and its physical and visual resolution\u2014what Matisse called his drive to a possession of his sensations\u2014is tangibly presented by this group of works. Together, they represent a remarkable example of the results of the artist\u2019s fluid approach to working in different media.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work was published as Nu appuy\u00e9 sur les mains/Figure portant sur les mains\u2014Figure \u00e0 la chemise retrouss\u00e9\u2014Nu \u00e0 la chemise relev\u00e9e/Woman Leaning on her Hands/Seated Woman Leaning on her Hands in Claude Duthuit and Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant, Henri Matisse: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre sculpt\u00e9 (Claude Duthuit, 1997), p. 42, cat. 17; p. 265; p. 352.\n\nDuthuit and de Gu\u00e9briant, Henri Matisse, p. 43, cat. 17, no. 9.

Matisse\u2019s sculpture was probably made from his study of the work in Paris but produced from memory while summering in Collioure in 1906.\n\nOn Matisse\u2019s engagement with these themes, see especially Thomas Puttfarken, \u201cMutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and \u2018gli Amori de\u2019 Carracci,\u201d Burlington Magazine 124, no. 949 (Apr. 1992), pp. 203\u201308; Margaret Werth, The Joy of Life: The Idyllic in French Art, circa 1900 (University of California Press, 2002); Alastair Wright, Matisse and the Subject of Modernism (Princeton University Press, 2004); and Joseph J.
