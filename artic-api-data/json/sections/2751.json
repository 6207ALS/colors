Then, working with a soft graphite pencil capable of producing broad lines and dark-gray tones, he anchored the figure with dark, heavy contours. The initial positions for the head, arms, and shoulder are evident. Keeping the proper left arm relatively unchanged, Matisse progressively raised the bent right arm and adjusted the back and shoulder to be correspondingly straighter and more upright (see fig. 15.1). He drew rapid, squiggly lines to add dimension to the figure, such as in the knees. He also used a stump to spread the soft graphite to shade the proper right knee and apply tone along the side of the proper left hip and leg to differentiate the figure from the background. Matisse also used the stump to soften lines indicating initial positions for the arms and shoulder (see fig. 15.1). The stump both diminishes the marks and produces the effect of shadow. Stray graphite smudges appear in the right half of the sheet. The smooth, tan wove paper allowed the artist to achieve even lines and tone without interference from a textured surface.\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 15.2); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, ivory color and makes another contrasting 2.5 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 35.9 \u00d7 27.7 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue is evident at the edges of the primary and secondary supports under magnification 80\u00d7 (see fig. 15.3).\n\nThe signature extends onto the secondary support, indicating that the drawing was signed after it was mounted (see fig. 15.4).\n\nSigned: Henri Matisse (lower right, extending onto secondary support, in graphite) (fig. 15.4).\n\nGraphite with stumping.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, tan wove paper. The edges are straight cut.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. This paper is soft and lightly sized. The edges are straight cut. The texture on the recto has been compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 15.5) a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light.\n\nPrimary support: 30.9 \u00d7 23.6 cm (12 1/8 \u00d7 9 1/2 in.); secondary support: 32.9 \u00d7 25.7 cm (12 7/8 \u00d7 10 in.); tertiary support: 37.9 \u00d7 30.5 cm (15 \u00d7 12 in.).\n\nA tear extending from the lower left edge of the tertiary support has been mended. There is no evidence that the work has undergone other treatment.\n\nThere are two small, faint water stains in the left margin of the tertiary support. There is a horizontal crease above the lower left corner of the tertiary support.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Stieglitz (Jan. 1, 1864\u2013July 13, 1946), New York, probably by Feb. 23, 1910\u2013July 13, 1946.\n\nBy descent to Alfred Stieglitz Estate, New York, July 13, 1946\u2013Nov. 9, 1949.\n\nBequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 9, 1949.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, An Exhibition of Drawings and Photographs of Paintings by Henri Matisse, Feb. 23\u2013Mar. 8, 1910, no cat.\n\nNew York, Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, An Exhibition of Sculpture\u2014the First in America\u2014and Recent Drawings by Henri Matisse, Mar. 14\u2013Apr. 6, 1912.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by Representative Modern Masters, Apr. 17\u2013May 9, 1920, cat. 154, as Drawing No. 2.\n\nNew York, An American Place, Beginnings and Landmarks: \u201c291\u201d 1905\u20131917, Oct. 27\u2013Dec. 27, 1937, cat. 35, as Drawing No. 2, 1910.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, History of an American, Alfred Stieglitz: \u201c291\u201d and After, July 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1944, cat. 55, as Nude Standing, 1910.\n\nChicago, Art Institute, Alfred Stiegltiz, His Photographs and His Collection, Feb. 2\u201329, 1948, no cat.\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse Retrospective 1966, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 149, as Standing Nude/Nu debout, 1908; traveled to Chicago, Art Institute, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966 and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019art moderne, Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture, May 29\u2013Sept. 7, 1975, cat. 33 (ill.), as Femme nue debout, de face, le corps tourn\u00e9 vers la gauche, 1906 (?) 1908 (?); traveled to Brussels, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Sept. 27\u2013Oct. 26, 1975 [as Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture/Tekeningen en sculpturen], cat. 31, as Femme nue debout, de face, le corps tourn\u00e9 vers la gauche and Staand naakt inn vooraanzicht, naar links gekeerd, 1906 (?) 1908 (?).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, Mar. 20\u2013June 20, 2010, cat. 3m (ill.), as Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back, 1908; New York, Museum of Modern Art, July 18\u2013Oct. 11, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Catalogue of an Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by Representative Modern Artists, exh. cat., with an introduction by Leopold Stokowski (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, 1920), p. 16, cat. 154, as Drawing No. 2.\n\nBeginnings and Landmarks: \u201c291\u201d 1905\u20131917, exh. cat., with text by Dorothy Norman (An American Place, 1937), cat. 35, as Drawing No. 2, 1910.\n\nHistory of an American, Alfred Stieglitz: \u201c291\u201d and After, exh. cat., with an introduction by Henry Clifford and Carl Zigrosser (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1944), p. 12, cat. 55, as Nude Standing, 1910.\n\nOliver Larkin, \u201cAlfred Stieglitz and \u2018291,\u2019\u201d Magazine of Art 40, no. 5 (May 1947), p. 182 (ill.).\n\nJean Leymarie, Herbert Read, and William S.
