Within a few years, at least twenty-five communities were founded, including the Hog Farm (which provided security at the Woodstock Festival), Morningstar East (established by a group fleeing violence against them in California), the Lama Foundation (a spiritual retreat that still survives despite a 1996 wildfire, which destroyed nearly all its buildings except the central dome), and the Family (a group marriage of fifty adults, most of whom lived in one house with one upstairs bathroom\u2014and many toothbrushes around the sink).\n\nThe exemplar of the Taos communal scene was New Buffalo, founded in 1967 by a group of people fascinated with Native American culture, on land donated by a wealthy young man intent on giving away his inheritance. The name \u201cNew Buffalo\u201d was chosen because the founders wanted the commune to function as the buffalo had for Native Americans\u2014provider of everything.\n\nNew Buffalo was an agrarian commune, simultaneously struggling with living off the land and coping with the instability of large numbers of short- and long-term visitors passing through. Timothy Miller points out in The 60s Communes that this conflict between openness and providing for newcomers may have been the central paradox of 1960s communalism: the more successful a commune became, the more attractive it grew to outsiders. The difficult decision to screen outsiders, and the means of initiating them into the daily practices and ethos of the group, often determined the fate of a commune. New Buffalo managed to survive in some form for nearly two decades, despite what has been termed the \u201cHippie-Chicano War\u201d: vandalism, and in some cases brutal violence, were directed at the Taos communes by members of the local population who resented much about the communards, including their ability to buy land or get up and leave if things got tough.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, the ownership of New Buffalo had reverted to Rick Klein, the young man who\u2019d given the land away many years before. He transformed it into New Buffalo Bed and Breakfast. At last account, it was for sale.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
