The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. There is a stamp from the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros on the original canvas back. The canvas weave exhibits a warp-thread match with Monet\u2019s \u00c9tretat: The Beach and the Falaise d\u2019Amont ([W1012], inv. 1964.204) (cat. 21) and Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele ([W1095], inv. 1964.210) (cat. 24), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The composition was built up with little deviation from the initial lay-in. It was carried out in several sessions, with a large degree of wet-in-wet paint application in the upper layers. Technical examination revealed some minor revisions including painted-out forms on the left side of the beach, possibly related to the fishing accoutrements, the painting out of what may have been a second window on the upper floor of the stone building, and the addition of some figures to the crowd of people on the right side of the work.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 23.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 85 (lower left corner, name in orange-red paint, year in reddish-brown paint) (fig. 23.2). The signature and date appear to have been applied at the same time, when the paint layers beneath were already dry.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 73.3 \u00d7 92.5 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (92 \u00d7 73 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 26.9H (0.8) \u00d7 28.5V (0.7) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with \u00c9tretat: The Beach and the Falaise d\u2019Amont (cat. 21 [W1012], inv. 1964.204) (cat. 21) and Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (cat. 24 [W1095], inv. 1964.210) (cat. 24).\n\nThere is relatively even cusping around all four edges. The cusping is stronger on the left and right sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: The current stretching dates to the 1962 conservation treatment; copper tacks spaced approximately 7\u20138 cm apart (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes, spaced approximately 5\u20137.5 cm apart, correspond to cusping in the canvas.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1962-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. According to the 1962 examination report, the previous stretcher was a five-membered stretcher with a vertical crossbar. Depth: Based on the presence of an additional crease in the tacking edge fabric, presumably where excess canvas was folded over the back edge of the stretcher, the original stretcher depth would have been approximately 1.8 cm.\n\nA supplier\u2019s stamp on the back of the canvas was transcribed before the painting was wax-resin lined in 1962 (see Conservation History) (text within palette-shaped frame):\n\nHA [sic] . . . T TROIS GROS [sic] / 39 [sic] RUE DE . . . / PARIS / . . . / . . . (fig. 23.3)\n\nOnly a faint trace of the canvas stamp was visible in transmitted infrared (fig. 23.4).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThere is a single ground layer. It extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground layer ranges from approximately 15 to 115 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 23.5). Some tiny bubble holes were observed in the ground layer where it was exposed at the edges of the painting.\n\nOff-white; under magnification, some dark particles are visible (fig. 23.6).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains primarily lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of bone black, iron oxide with associated silicates, alumina, aluminum silicate, and silica. Both the lead white and the chalk exhibit particles and clusters of various sizes (fig. 23.7). Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe main compositional elements\u2014the three caloges, the stone building, the winches, most of the figures, and the boats\u2014were incorporated into the composition early on, either painted directly over the ground layer or wet-in-wet into the first underpainting layer. The beach and the water were then built up around them (fig. 23.8). A border of exposed or thinly painted ground often remains at the edges of the forms (fig. 23.9). This is evident around the sails and some of the figures, particularly around the foreground figure and the open caloge door (fig. 23.10). It looks as if the larger sailboats were articulated with quick strokes of the brush in pale purplish-gray paint. The water was then brought up around the boats, the sails were reinforced using slightly more intense colors, and then the reflections were added in the water (fig. 23.11). Some of the smaller sailboats in the distance were succinctly indicated with a quick brushstroke into the wet underpainting layer of the water; the water was then built up and a final stroke was applied overtop to indicate the sail when the paint from the water was already surface dry (fig. 23.12).\n\nAs the painting progressed, the artist moved back and forth between the compositional elements and the background, building up the forms and reinforcing the contours. This can be seen, for example, in the group of figures on the left shoreline. The group was roughly laid in early on, as evidenced by the relative radio-transparency of this area of the painting (fig. 23.13), as well as by glimpses of the thin reddish and bluish-gray paint that was used to lay in the general forms of the figures directly over the ground layer (fig. 23.14). The water was then built up with the thick, horizontal strokes of pale bluish-green paint, and the individual figures were painted wet-in-wet on top (fig. 23.15). The figures themselves were composed with quick gestural strokes, often consisting of incompletely mixed color, with touches of more intense local color applied on top (fig. 23.16). The pinkish-gray paint of the beach was then added, coming up over the figures in places. The group of figures on the right side of the painting seems to have been planned from early on, as some of the figures were painted directly over the ground layer, which remains exposed in between brushstrokes (fig. 23.17). Other figures from the group on the right were added wet-in-wet over the water (in the case of the figures on the far left) and over the dry paint of the beach (the figures at the lower center of the group), indicating that the group was expanded as the painting developed.\n\nTechnical imaging has revealed a few minor revisions to the painting. In the upper half of the stone building, there is a broad, radio-opaque, vertical stroke near the right edge (fig. 23.18). Although the paint here is handled differently from the way the other windows of this building were composed, the size, shape, and placement of the strong vertical stroke seems to echo that of the other extant windows, perhaps suggesting that a second upper-story window was planned and then subsequently blocked out with the vertical stroke. In the water, just above the building, two relatively radio-transparent areas in the X-ray suggest that either the small, three-sailed boat was originally laid in slightly to the upper left of its current position or that one or two smaller boats were planned (fig. 23.19). A small modification was also made to the discarded winch in the foreground. The X-ray shows that the winch was laid in at a slightly different angle compared to the final painting (fig. 23.20). Some possible revisions on the left shore are revealed with the aid of infrared reflectography. Between the small boat and the caloge, there are three or four vertical forms that have been partially covered by paint from the beach and the diagonal poles. Traces of the underlying paint related to these vertical features remain visible on the surface (fig. 23.21), becoming slightly more discernible in the infrared image (fig. 23.22). It is unclear whether these are props raising the ends of the poles off the ground, or whether they could possibly have been conceived as figures (the form on the far right, which is roughly circular at the top, looks similar to how some of the distant figures were rendered) (fig. 23.23). On the shoreline near the left edge, another form is visible in the infrared reflectogram (fig. 23.24). Reddish-brown paint from this underlying form can also be seen through breaks in the brushwork of the beach and the water, applied on top (fig. 23.25). It is not clear what this form may have represented. Other minor adjustments were made to the contours of forms as the painting was built up; for example, on the middle caloge, the back peak of the roof seems to have been shifted slightly to the left, between the initial planning and the final painting (fig. 23.26).\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). There are a few brush hairs embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence of some of the red strokes indicates the use of red lake throughout the painting, except in the water. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that Monet sometimes used surprisingly complex pigment mixtures; for example, the dull gray caloge roof contains a mixture of several brightly colored pigments (fig. 23.27).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 2006 and left unvarnished (see Conservation History).\n\nThe painting was cleaned and varnished in 1922.\n\nIn 1962, discolored varnish was removed. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied, followed by a final spray coat of methacrylate resin L-46. The previous lining was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on a new ICA spring stretcher.\n\nIn 2006, the synthetic varnish applied in 1962, as well as older, yellowed, natural-resin varnish residues, were removed. A few tiny spots were inpainted. The surface was left unvarnished.\n\nIn 2007, a small fragment of original canvas that had come loose from the lining canvas was readhered.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. The tacking margins show some wear and abrasion from handling. The ground and paint layers are secure with only a few tiny losses near the edges and minimal retouching. There are a few brush hairs embedded in the paint layer. Some flattening of the paint around the edges appears to be the result of framing while the paint was still soft. There is a network of fine cracks (visible, for the most part, only under magnification) with more pronounced cracking in areas of thick paint application. The surface is currently unvarnished, although there are microscopic residues of yellowed varnish in the recesses of the paint texture.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed by 2011): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, eighteenth-century, Salvator Rosa, plain-molded, scotia frame with ogee back and stepped ogee sight molding. The frame is water gilded over thin yellow bole on gesso. The convex top molding is burnished, with all other areas matte. The scotia sides and back flat edge are painted in yellow ocher. The original glue size is retained throughout. The frame is made of poplar with applied mitered back, front, and sight moldings on a half-lapped cassetta base. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ogee; scotia side; convex face with treacle back edge; stepped fillet; scotia; ogee; torus; stepped ogee; and cove (fig. 23.28).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed in 2011): The work was previously housed in an American, twentieth-century, Louis XIII, gilded, convex frame with acanthus-leaf-and-flower motif, plain hollow, and ogee sight molding with cabled flower motif. The frame also had an independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 23.29).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933): Late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Rococo Revival frame with cast plaster foliate rocaille cartouches and rocaille ornament with independent fillet liner and cove sight (fig. 23.30).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 21, 1892, for 6,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, Dec. 21, 1892, for 6,000 francs.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to his wife, Bertha Honor\u00e9 Palmer, Chicago.\n\nOn deposit from Bertha Honor\u00e9 Palmer, Chicago, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Mar. 17, 1909\u2013May 9, 1911.\n\nBy descent from Bertha Honor\u00e9 Palmer (died 1918), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, May 23\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 293.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that is used by the catalogue raisonn\u00e9. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\n\nDec. 21, 1892: Caloges d\u2019Etretat (Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book 1891\u20131901 [no. 2548]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 5, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nMar. 17, 1909: Caloges d\u2019Etretat (Durand-Ruel, New York, deposit book 1894\u20131925 [no. 7535]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 5, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nFor further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixtures for both the signature and the date contain lead white, vermilion, and red lake. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Depart\\_22\\_428\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. PLM analysis of a scraping from the t found vermilion, red lake, viridian, emerald green, ultramarine blue, and possibly cobalt blue. The scraping, taken in 1983, was reexamined by PLM in 2013. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 17, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the measured dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching the painting on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat (W1025/1922.428),\u201d Aug. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the canvases for the three paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet W1012, W1025, W1095,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Apr. 3, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe original canvas back is now obscured by the lining canvas.\n\nThis is probably the stamp of Vieille &amp; Troisgros: H Vieille E Troisgros / 35 Rue de Laval 35 / Paris / Couleurs Fines / Toiles Panneaux\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. The ground scraping taken in 1983 was reexamined in 2013 by PLM. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013; and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 17, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Depart\\_22\\_428\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA small amount of angular, brownish-black particles, which could be charcoal, was observed in several of the paint sample scrapings. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_report,\u201d Oct. 17, 2013. It is possible that these particles are associated with limited underdrawing and were incorporated into the paint when they were painted over. Where charcoal underdrawing was detected in other Monet paintings, the material present was minimal\u2014usually not detectable with infrared reflectography (IRR)\u2014and similar particles were also observed in the paint samples.\n\nA caloge is a retired fishing boat that has been converted into a storehouse by covering the hull with either tarred wooden planks or thatch.\n\nInterestingly, a similar radio-opaque area appears in the same location on the related Art Institute painting Boats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat (1885; 1947.95 [W1024]) (cat. 22). In that painting, however, the artist seems to have retained the suggestion of a second window on the upper floor. In both paintings, the \u201cwindow\u201d seems like an afterthought, but in Departure of the Boats it was ultimately obscured from view, whereas in Boats on the Beach it was retained. Departure of the Boats was painted on a slightly larger canvas than that of Boats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat. Compared with Boats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat, the forms in this painting are more detailed and defined. This can be seen, for example, if one compares the lower windows of the stone building or the winches, just to the left, in each painting.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue (XRF, PLM); ultramarine blue, red lake (PLM). Traces of fine black particles were observed by PLM in some samples but it is unclear whether these are pigment particles. XRF analysis detected traces of iron in some dark reddish-brown areas of the painting which could indicate the presence of iron oxide pigments; however, further analysis would be required to confirm this. Paint scrapings taken in 1979 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013; Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_428\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_report,\u201d Oct. 17, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Depart\\_22\\_428\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 17, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.
