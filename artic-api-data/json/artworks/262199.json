    "description": "<p>John Baptiste Fischer worked as Head Draughtsman for the firm of Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge in Chicago, Illinois from 1901-1909. Around this time he became affiliatted with Postle and Fischer and worked in this firm as a lead designer and engineer for many projects from c.1910-1920s. Although Fischer was based out of Chicago, he worked on projects across the country including locations such as Phoenix, Arizona and Casper, Wyoming. Fischer put his talents into many buildings on the University of Chicago campus including the Law School, Gymnasium, and William Rainey Harper Memorial Library. John Fischer utilized a Gothic style in much of his work, which is documented in this small collection. Fischer was a contributing editor for the Architectural Record in February 1905 as well. This collection documents a number of projects on which John Baptiste Fischer worked as designer and engineer. The firms Shepley, Rutan, and Coolidge and Postle and Fischer are well represented in this collection.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Fischer,%20John%20B.,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
