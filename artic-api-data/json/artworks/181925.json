    "description": "<p>Charles Marville worked as a painter and illustrator until he took up photography in 1850, contributing images to commercially published photo albums, reproducing works of art in the Louvre, and documenting the decorations for imperial events. By 1862 his carefully composed images had earned him the designation \u201cPhotographer of the City of Paris,\u201d as well as a commission to document Baron Haussmann\u2019s modernization of the city. Marville also recorded the restoration of many of the great French cathedrals, a program championed by Gothic Revival architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc. This photograph depicts one of Viollet-le-Duc\u2019s projects before restoration: the 13th-century Church of Our Lady of the Nativity, located in the small village of Villeneuve-le-Comte, outside Paris. With subtle gradations in tonality and a sharp focus, Marville captured the church\u2019s main entrance in rich detail, including brooms inside the doorway to show scale and human presence.</p>\n",
