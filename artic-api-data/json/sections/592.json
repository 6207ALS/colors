The son of Richard Dummer and his second wife, Frances, he was born in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1645, and began his apprenticeship at age thirteen with the Boston silversmith John Hull (see cat. 1 and cat. 2). On July 1, 1659, Hull wrote in his diary, \u201cI received into my house Jeremie Dummer and Samuel Paddy to serve me as apprentices eight years. The Lord make me faithful in discharge of this new trust committed to me and let this blessing be to me and them.\u201d For Dummer this trust ended successfully in 1667, and he probably worked for Hull for a brief period thereafter until 1670; that year he opened his own shop, where he trained some important New England silversmiths of the next generation, including John Dixwell (see cat. 12), Edward Winslow (see cat. 9), and his brother-in-law John Coney. Dummer's stature in the community was enhanced by his advantageous marriage in 1672 to Anna Atwater, daughter of the merchant Joshua Atwater. He held numerous public offices and engraved the plates for currency printing for Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. By 1709 Dummer was in precarious health\u2014\u201cso weak . . . . he can scarce go about &amp; such numbness . . . he could not wright,\u201d as Coney noted in a letter that year. A number of objects made after this date suggest that Dummer kept his shop going\u2014possibly until his death\u2014through the aid of journeymen, metalsmiths who had completed their apprenticeships and could work for pay. More than 150 objects with his mark survive, attesting to patronage from throughout New England, including many Congregational churches.\n\nMost of the vessels made by silversmiths of Dummer\u2019s era, such as this caudle cup and tankard, were used for the consumption of alcoholic beverages. A bulbous-bodied form with two handles, the caudle cup was popular in late seventeenth-century New England. It was designed to serve caudle, a warm concoction of wine or ale, sweetened with sugar or honey, thickened with flour or bread crumbs and egg yolks, and enlivened by various spices, with recipes that date back to the Middle Ages. The handles protected the drinker\u2019s hands from the hot sides of the vessel while facilitating the passing of the cup for communal drinking. Wine and ale were also imbibed from caudle cups; indeed, the double handles prompted many churches to adopt this form for wine shared by the congregation during communion. The Farmington, Connecticut, church owned three caudle cups by Dummer as part of its communion service. In all, more than thirty examples by Dummer survive.\n\nThe tankard was a large and therefore costly lidded vessel intended for the drinking of beer or ale. The cut-card decoration applied to the flat lid and the cherub mask at the handle terminal of this work reveal the influence of the new Baroque style. This technique first appeared on London silver in the 1660s and subsequently spread to the British colonies, but its use in British North America was rare. In cut-card ornamentation, thin sheets of silver with decorative outlines are soldered to the body of the vessel. In addition to being decorative, the sheets could add strength, especially where handles were attached to bodies. Many of Dummer\u2019s tankards feature this type of decoration at both the lid and the handle joints. More tankards by Dummer with this decoration survive than by any other known Boston maker. The outline of the cut-card embellishment on the Richard Conyers tankard at the Winterthur Museum is remarkably similar to that on the lid of this example. Since Conyers was trained in London between 1682 and 1689 and practiced there before coming to Boston by 1698, he may have been responsible for introducing this kind of ornamentation to Boston.  \nPatricia Kane\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">American Antiquarian Society (1857), vol. 3, p. 150.\n\nFor the details of Dummer\u2019s life and work, see Kane et al.
