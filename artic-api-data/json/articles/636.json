    "copy": " Badminton House in Gloucestershire, England, is perhaps best known as the home of the first badminton game, played on a rainy day in 1863, but was the principal country residence for the Dukes of Beaufort. Additions to decor were made across the generations, and this library ladder was one of the 5th Duke of Beaufort\u2019s, added in 1782. In the account books for that year, there is an entry\u2014\u201cFebruary 23 to Wm France Library Ladder 16 Pounds 11\u201d\u2014referring to the London cabinetmaker William France, Jr. As a scholar, the 5th Duke paid careful attention to the decoration of his library, and included this stunning mahogany ladder that reaches just over 8 feet tall. The Chinese-style cutouts decorating the sides seem to have been inspired by the Chinese-style bed at Badminton, building on past generations\u2019 additions. Take a closer look at Library Ladder. ",
