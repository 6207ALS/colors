The beauty of a mask or a figure is often related to its religious function and dependent on how it appeals to the residents of the supernatural realm. Join curator Constantine Petridis to explore objects that were created to honor and entice the gods and the ancestors among the Yoruba, the Dogon, and the Luluwa, and to lure and appease the spirits of the forests and the waters among the Baule, the Kuba, and the Ijo.</p>",
