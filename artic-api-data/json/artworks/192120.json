Get him!-sounds a cry from all directions.\n\nOutpaced by the she-wolf and his cubs,\nThe wolf began experiencing, as we say, drama:\n-The peasants have a sinister plan.\n\nDanger is eminent: if it's not a trap,\nThen it is a wolf pit...\n\nThe peasants will come...will take you alive...\nWhat a shameful welcoming!..\n\nThey will beat you!.. Beat you to death!..\n\nWith his pitiful whimpering, the wolf\nFilled the entire forest, while flooding with tears:\n-And to think, some liar tried to convince me\nThat men have ethics, morals!\n\nIt is precisely ethics that they lack!",
