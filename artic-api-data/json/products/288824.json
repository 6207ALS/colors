    "description": "<p>Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) is recognized world-wide as one of the greatest architects of the twentieth century. His work heralded a new thinking in architecture, using innovation in design and engineering made possible by newly developed technology and materials. His creative ability extended far beyond the border of architecture to graphic design, furniture, art glass, textiles, and decorative elements for the home.</p>\n<p>Frank Lloyd Wright designed well over 4,000 leaded glass windows and doors for over 150 of his buildings. Wright also created art glass designs for doors, skylights, back-lit ceilings panels, table lamps, and wall sconces. The famed \u201cTree of Life\u201d art glass pattern is found in several variations in Wright\u2019s Darwin D. Martin House. The variation on this coaster is found on the central landing of the Martin House stairway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 12oz</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.5 x 3.25 x 4.25 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Double wall ultra insulated using high-grade stainless steel</li>\n<li><strong>BPA free</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dishwasher safe</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hot or cold for up to 12 hours</strong></li>\n</ul>",
