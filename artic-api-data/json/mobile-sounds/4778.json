    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>Upon entering the Rice Building you encounter the Roger McCormick Sculpture Court. Here Kruger installed her 1997 statue Justice among the neoclassical sculptures in this gallery.</p>\n<p>The label for Justice reads:</p>\n<p>In 1997 Barbara Kruger created four fiberglass statues (not sculptures, as the artist specifies) of key iconic figures in compromising poses\u2014a departure from Kruger\u2019s two-dimensional practice. In doing so, she attempted to address the unexamined constructions of history and the problematic place of public commemorative monuments: questioning who is honored and why. Justice depicts notorious American lawyer Roy Cohn (1927 to 1986) wearing heels and draped in an American flag while kissing former Director of the Federal Investigation Bureau J. Edgar Hoover (1895 to 1972). Kruger chose an intimate embrace that stands in contrast to her subjects\u2019 political personas and their homophobic, racist, and anti-democratic policies\u2014a choice the artist described as \u201ctrying to break down the sanctity around the rallying calls for \u2018Justice\u2019 and \u2018Family\u2019 and deal with the complex contradictions of public and private lives.\u201d</p>\n<p>Kruger classicized the life-size figures using a bright white finish. In placing Justice among the neoclassical works in this gallery, the artist draws a connection between the virtuous expressions of our nation\u2019s past and this statue, which questions traditional commemorations.</p>\n",
