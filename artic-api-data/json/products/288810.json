    "description": "<p>The Impressionists were known for capturing their subjects in the moment, creating landscapes and scenes of everyday life that act as snapshots of time. Gardens were the perfect source of inspiration for the Impressionists: the vivid colors and unique shapes of the flowers and foliage perfectly complemented the artists\u2019 playful approach to painting. Meticulous attention to color and light, along with their characteristic rapid brushstrokes, allowed these painters to produce masterpieces that encourage us to reimagine how we see the gardens, blossoms, and greenery surrounding us. Twelve gardens are featured in this calendar, bringing the beauty of Impressionism to you every day of the year.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12 x 13 in, Opens to: 12 x 26 in.</li>\n<li><strong>12 monthly grids and full-color artwork</strong></li>\n<li><strong>High-quality printing with soy-based inks on premium, environmentally sourced paper stock</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Exceptional color quality</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Grid pages are easy to write on</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Features US, Canadian, and United Kingdom legal holidays</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Perfect for hanging at home or over an office desk</strong></li>\n</ul>",
