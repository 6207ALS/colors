Although he lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, the planks on which he carved this pair, derived from the same piece of wood, must have been in the best condition among the group of ten blocks. While the grain of the planks is visible in impressions pulled from both, the planks are not as coarse, nor are the irregularities in their surfaces as abundant, as those present in others used for the suite. Even so, these irregularities still set the prints in the suite apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images that make up Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite (cats. 51\u201360). He himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nBefore Gauguin proceeded to produce a second state of this wood block, he printed a handful of trial proofs, and then printed the first state in an edition of about thirty impressions on thin, translucent Japanese papers\u2014not in the black ink that characterizes the majority of prints in the series, but rather in dark-gray or ocher inks. The production of a large number of first-state impressions in an expanded ink palette suggests that Gauguin had other aspirations for these impressions from early on in their production, and indeed, he used them in a most innovative manner by adhering second state impressions printed on translucent, diaphanous sheets of Japanese paper on top of them. Elements of the first-state impressions may be read through the second state impressions (see fig. 104.2.2).\n\nFor this print, Gauguin used the secondary support for two purposes. After using the paper to print a first-state impression in ocher ink on one side, he then turned it over and used the back of it when printing a second-state impression on a sheet of the thin diaphanous paper to provide support during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block, and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he then lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter one. This technique prevented the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block. At the same time, some ink, and the oil used to dilute it, penetrated through the thin paper onto the thick paper, resulting in the offset mirror image that we see today.\n\nThe complex layering of media here is a result of the artist\u2019s skillful manipulation of his materials, which includes altering the consistency and intensity of his inks to suit specific purposes. Here three ink transfers took place. First, to print the uppermost second-state impression, Gauguin used black ink, to which he added linseed oil (est.) to cut its viscosity. If the ink had been too thick and viscous, the thin paper would have stuck to it and torn when he tried to lift it. Yellow ocher (est.) ink was used to print the first-state impression beneath it on the sturdy secondary support. Little can be said about the viscosity of this ink layer since the second-state impression is adhered on top of it. Under magnification the yellow tone of the ocher is much more obvious. Turning this sheet over, a partial offset impression in black ink\u2014a mirror image of the second state\u2014was transferred onto the paper. This impression is laden with oil that has darkened to a golden tone and struck through to the front (see fig. 104.2.3). Close study of the recto reveals the oil strike-through of the horse and areas surrounding it. Under ultraviolet light, oil strike-through from the recto of the underlying impression is quite pronounced and fluoresces bright yellow.\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with mitsumata (est.) fibers and minimal sizing to print a second-state impression that was then adhered, deliberately askew, to a first-state impression, which was printed on grayish-ivory wove paper. Gauguin reused a sheet of this paper that had previously been folded vertically along the left side of the composition, 49 mm in from the left edge. The paper is a machine-made paper of average thickness, used most commonly as stationery, and it is moderately sized. In printing, the ink gathered along the crease on both the front and the back to form a pronounced line between the two figures at left (fig. 104.2.4). The sheet was irregularly trimmed on all sides.\n\n164 \u00d7 301 mm (image); 165 \u00d7 301 mm (primary/secondary support)\n\nWhen Gauguin altered the block to produce the second state, he gouged away many of the more finely incised passages that appear in first-state impressions, perhaps in order to make this composition more visually consistent with the rest of the group. Broad tonal passages were replaced with linear forms\u2014what started as much more of a tone block was reworked into a line block.\n\nThe finely incised lines in this first-state impression suggest that this particular plank of wood may not have been as soft and easily chipped by Gauguin\u2019s tools as others in the group. His incising appeared throughout, the finest of which is in the foreground at center and in the upper right.\n\nCondition reports from 1995, 1999, and 2007 note slight undulations in the sheet.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition overall. It has been matted with Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105.2) to form a frieze. The impressions were abutted for visual continuity and Japanese paper hinges were used to secure each to the mount.  \nHarriet K.

Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nGauguin wrote to Vollard in January 1900: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d Gauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, reprinted in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190. See also Richard R. Brettell, \u201cSuite of Late Woodcuts, 1898\u20131899,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F. Stuckey, The Art of Paul Gauguin, with assistance from Peter Zegers, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice. See also cats. 93 and 94, 96 and 97, 100 and 101, and 102 and 103 for paired examples of extant wood blocks that originally formed one thicker block.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . . Faites sur des planches quelconques et avec des yeux de plus en plus mauvais, ces gravures sortent forc\u00e9ment du sale m\u00e9tier ordinaire et sont tr\u00e8s imparfaites, mais elles sont je crois int\u00e9ressantes comme Art\u201d (I am sending you a small series of wood engravings. . . . Made on some wood planks, and with my failing eyesight, these engravings are necessarily produced by a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form). Gauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 1899, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 Daniel de Monfreid, ed. Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.

Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 209, cat. 54.\n\nAlternatively, Gauguin also printed some second-state impressions directly over first-state impressions, although here the resultant woodcuts have a less ethereal quality. See, for example, an impression in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris.\n\nThe oil medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s technique, and printmaking techniques in general.\n\nThe estimation of yellow ocher (an iron oxide) is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s printmaking materials and techniques. Iron oxide inks such as ocher were identified by XRF analysis in impressions of Te atua (The God) (cat. 53.4) and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.3), for example.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2), and mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nHarriet K.
