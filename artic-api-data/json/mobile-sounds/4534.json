    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: On this golden coin we see the profile of Arsinoe II, who was queen of Egypt during the Ptolemaic period. Curator Ashley Arico.</p>\n<p>Ashley Arico: The Ptolemaic Dynasty in Ancient Egypt was the longest ruling of Egypt\u2019s dynastic families. It was part of a period of Greek rule in Egypt, which started when Alexander the Great, King of Macedon, who conquered Egypt in 332 BC.</p>\n<p>Narrator: When Alexander died he had no clear successor, so his empire was divided up with Egypt going to his childhood friend and general Ptolemy.</p>\n<p>Ashley: So it\u2019s his direct decedents who make up the rest of the Ptolemaic Dynasty.</p>\n<p>Arsinoe as a person is kind of interesting, because she was a very powerful woman who clearly sought out power.</p>\n<p>Narrator: This search for power began as early as her teenage years when she was married to the ruler Lysimachus.</p>\n<p>Ashley: The story goes that to help secure her children\u2019s position in the line of succession, she had his son by his first wife executed for treason.</p>\n<p>Narrator: And then there was the time with her second husband, Ptolemy Keraunos.</p>\n<p>Ashley: She also tries to overthrow him, but he finds out about it and has her two younger sons executed and Arsinoe is exiled to Egypt.</p>\n<p>Narrator: By her third husband, Arisone may have been ready to settle down, and what better way to do that than by keeping it in the family?</p>\n<p>Ashley: It\u2019s at this point that she marries her full brother, Ptolemy II.</p>\n<p>Narrator: If you could flip this coin over, you\u2019d actually find a hint at this familial marriage. On the back side you would find two names, Arsinoe and Philadelphus, meaning sibling loving.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Arsinoe was worshiped throughout Egypt after Ptolemy decreed that she and their parents were gods.</p>\n<p>Ashley: So this coin we\u2019re looking at here is actually issued after Arsinoe\u2019s death, which is somewhat unusual for a coin depicting a ruler, but by this time she\u2019s been elevated to the position of not just a queen but a goddess.</p>\n",
