They were made in a range of shapes and sizes and often preserve visual hints about who the deceased person was in life. In this example, three larger-than-life-sized figures are chiseled so deeply into the stone that they are carved nearly in the round. The two male individuals are shown clasping hands\u2014a parting gesture common in funerary scenes. While there is no text to conclusively identify the figures, the standing man is likely the person who died, shown sharing a final farewell with his loved ones, perhaps his mother and father.</p>\n",
