It is one of about 100 male and female nude studies in black and white chalk on blue paper that the artist made between 1810 and 1821. This model has been identified as the dark-haired beauty Marguerite, who famously caught the eye of Frederick William III, king of Prussia, in Prud\u2019hon\u2019s studio in 1814.</p>\n",
