Marx Purchase Fund, 1972.427\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Henri Matisse made this drawing of dancer and choreographer L\u00e9onide Massine following his work on the Ballets Russes\u2019s production of Le chant du rossignol (The Song of the Nightingale) (see fig. 32.1, fig. 32.2, and fig. 32.3). The ballet, which was based on the fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen and set to music by Igor Stravinsky, was an unusual project for the artist. He had never before been asked to produce art for the stage, and at the time he was focused on the paintings and works on paper that marked his transition from rigorous, abstracted compositions to a more figurative style dominated by languorous female models, exotic props, and staged decor. In fact, when Ballets Russes founder and patron Serge Diaghilev and Stravinsky called upon Matisse in the summer of 1919, the artist was reluctant to accept their offer. Perhaps spurred by his rival Pablo Picasso, who at the time was working on a production of Le tricorne (The Three-Cornered Hat), Matisse did, however, take the job, and by October 1920 he had arrived in London to begin work. It was here that he met Massine, who would help him translate his vision and calm his anxieties when the designs did not at first work on the large, dimly lit stage (see fig. 32.4).\n\nLike Matisse\u2019s other drawings of this time, the portrait of Massine reflects a greater interest in representation and a \u201creturn to order\u201d; the straightforward and studied approach may also speak to the artist\u2019s respect for the choreographer and dancer, on whom he relied throughout his work for the Ballets Russes. The portrait contrasts starkly with Picasso\u2019s drawing of him (fig. 32.5) made around the same time, which is also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. In his work, Picasso depicted Massine in three-quarter profile, setting down lines of varying width and fine, precise hatching to soften the sitter\u2019s face. Matisse, on the other hand, employed dark outlines and placed his marks quickly; in doing so, he produced a more angular version of Massine\u2019s features. The dancer looks straight at the viewer with a calm confidence, and the subtle asymmetry and slightly askew dress heighten rather than distract from his charm. The artist utilized hatching to articulate texture in the hair and clothing and to build form and volume in the face, which is especially visible in the cheekbones and around the bridge of the nose. Unlike Picasso, however, Matisse used his hatch marks sparingly, creating a more open composition. Devoid of props or background, the work is concentrated on Massine\u2019s face and eyes, which convey the subject\u2019s liveliness and intensity. The work, in which Massine is presented as full of confidence and self-assurance, may indicate the dancer\u2019s importance for the artist during the production of the Le chant du rossignol. Although Massine would describe the ballet as \u201cone of my most successful efforts at collaborating with a designer,\u201d the labor-intensive work and long hours, coupled with Diaghilev\u2019s increasingly insistent demands, made for an unsatisfying experience for Matisse. It was only with the encouragement of Massine that the artist would again design for the stage, in 1938 for the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo. Regardless, Matisse and the experience of Le chant du rossignol remained important to Massine and he kept his portrait until just a few years before his death.  \nKatja Rivera\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse chose a soft, dark graphite pencil and ivory wove paper for this work. He adjusted his drawing pressure to achieve variation in the graphite tone from a light gray to almost black.\n\nThe artist laid in the composition with light pencil lines. Then, using light to moderate pressure, he proceeded to shade and model the forms with parallel hatching and, less frequently, cross-hatching. He finished by articulating the major contours with heavy, dark graphite lines achieved by increasing the pressure on his pencil. (Raking light on the recto reveals some incising from the pencil along the dark contours.) He exploited the dark graphite to shade and strengthen the sitter\u2019s hair, eyebrows, and eyes. The whites of the pupils were left in reserve (see fig. 32.6).\n\nThere are several erased elements that indicate previous positions for both ears (further out from the head), the proper left eye (slightly wider and slightly lower; see fig. 32.6), and the side of the sitter\u2019s head at upper left (previously wider); considered together, these changes show that Matisse initially made the head narrower. He erased the earlier forms in those areas and elsewhere made other, more subtle adjustments with the eraser, such as to the lapel at right.\n\nThere is a faint, rounded graphite form with two loops protruding from the top along the right edge, below the center, just above the sitter\u2019s proper left shoulder.\n\nThe graphite is slightly smudged in some areas, such as the sitter\u2019s chin and cheeks. This likely occurred as Matisse drew the image and may have prompted the application of fixative. Examination under ultraviolet light (254 nm) reveals gray fixative droplets of various sizes sprayed across the sheet. The deposition pattern suggests the fixative was applied to the surface through an atomizer or mouth-blowing apparatus (see fig. 32.7 and fig. 32.8). Ultraviolet-light examination also indicates the sheet was pinned at both upper corners before it was applied; the area covered by the tack head, around each pinhole, appears significantly brighter than the surrounding sheet, which has a grayer cast from the fixative. The fixative is neither visible under normal light nor with the aid of a microscope.\n\nSigned and inscribed: 28 avril 1920. Monte Carlo / Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 32.9).\n\nMatisse drew using graphite with erasing. The drawing is fixed.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The right and lower edges are straight cut. The top and left edges are slightly uneven. On the left there is a partial deckle edge and the top appears to have a trimmed deckle edge. Media extends onto the edges, indicating the sheet was trimmed prior to drawing. There are pinholes at the upper corners and lower edge, center.\n\n39.7 \u00d7 28.8 cm (15 5/8 \u00d7 11 3/8 in.).\n\nIn 2008 the drawing underwent conservation treatment to reduce accretions, staining, and overall paper discoloration; remove old hinges and adhesive residues from the verso (fig. 32.10); and reduce undulations overall.\n\nThe graphite is in good condition with minor smudging in discrete areas that was likely caused by the artist while drawing. There is surface soil around the image and along the sheet edges, possibly including fingerprints, which may be the artist\u2019s. The top and left edges are slightly darkened. There is a faint foxing spot located in the upper right quadrant. On the verso, there is a faint yellow pattern of staining remaining from a previous mount. The sheet shows slight undulations along the top and left edges.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Given by the artist to L\u00e9onide Massine (1896\u20131979), Monte Carlo, Apr. 28, 1920\u2013July 7, 1971.\n\nSold through Sotheby and Company, London, lot 89, to D.
