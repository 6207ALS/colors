    "description": "<p>After encountering Cubist and Surrealist approaches to painting during the 20th century, Cuban artist Wifredo Lam turned to his religious upbringing within<em> La Regla Lucum\u00ed</em> for inspiration. The Afro-Cuban <em>Lucumi</em> religion, sometimes referred to as <em>santer\u00eda</em>, provided Lam with a visual vocabulary for drawings and paintings that spoke to the artist\u2019s multifaceted identity. Join museum educator Paulina Lopez to explore the histories and motifs woven in Lam\u2019s artworks. </p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
