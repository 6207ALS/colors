    "description": "<p>Trained in both folk and academic traditions, Constantin Brancusi sought his own path for sculpture around 1907. Breaking with the currents of the time, he adopted direct carving, combined different materials for single works, and simplified form in his search for his subjects\u2019 essential characters. His works have profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction.</p>\n<p>More than any other theme, Brancusi\u2019s series <em>Bird</em> summarizes his quest for a self-sufficient form. \u201cAll my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight,\u201d the artist once said. He began the first of twenty-seven <em>Bird</em> sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations <em>Maiastra</em>, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute\u2019s <em>Golden Bird</em>, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Br\u00e2ncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree\u2019s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.</p>\n",
