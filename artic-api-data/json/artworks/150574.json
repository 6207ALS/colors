    "description": "<p>The theme of fish is often found in works of art made by the diverse peoples of ancient Peru. Numerous costal cultures embraced marine life, especially the abundance it provided as a primary source of food. In addition, the ocean was associated with the sacred underworld, with many aquatic animals serving as both predator\u2014such as the killer whale\u2014and prey. The centrality of the ocean is clearly expressed by this textile fragment displaying a school of fish. Rows of colorful abstract fish motifs are interspersed with stepped-fret designs, creating a visually rhythmic pattern and an expression of the sea's bounty.</p>\n",
