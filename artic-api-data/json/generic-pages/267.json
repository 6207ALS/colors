    "copy": " Tasked with research on material aspects of the museum\u2019s vast collection of diverse artworks, conservation scientists use a variety of scientific tools, adapted from the fields of medicine, forensics, geology, and computer science, among many others, to undertake a broad range of activities that reveal fascinating aspects of the objects\u2019 biographies and inform their treatment and preservation. Our work includes the characterization of artists\u2019 materials and techniques, testing of display and storage environments, and analysis of conservation materials in support of treatments. We do this work in close collaboration with the museum\u2019s conservators and curators and, on occasion, with manufacturers of artists\u2019 materials and the artists themselves. The science laboratories are equipped with advanced analytical instrumentation for the investigation of all possible materials used by artists\u2014including pigments, binding media, plastics, metal alloys, glass, and ceramics\u2014as well as those used by conservators. We regularly collaborate with Chicago-based research facilities as well as an international community of colleagues, and work with fellows, interns, and visiting scientists hosted each year by the Department of Conservation and Science.
