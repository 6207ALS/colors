Comparing this work to his first portrait of Alfred Sisley (fig. 4.1 [Daulte 37; Dauberville 525]) and his picture of Alfred\u2019s father, William Sisley (fig. 4.2 [Daulte 11; Dauberville 524]), makes clear how much Renoir\u2019s pursuit of Impressionism over more than a decade opened up innovative paths of exploration. The elder Sisley moved to Paris from London in 1839 to manage a company dealing in luxury goods, with a specialty in imported gloves. Alfred was born on October 30 of the same year. Renoir\u2019s portraits of the two Sisley men, depicted at the height of their prosperity, were important early commissions for the young artist, and he did not stray far from convention in pose, handling, and color. The image of William was accepted at the Salon of 1865 and ably proclaimed Renoir\u2019s competence and skill as a portraitist to the Parisian public.\n\nEleven years later, in 1876, Renoir presented Alfred in a very different aspect. No longer is he the self-assured son of a comfortable bourgeois family, confident of his future. Instead he sits casually, facing the back of a mass-produced, bamboo-style side chair, with a distracted gaze that conveys a thoughtful introspection uncharacteristic of representations of men in nineteenth-century France, which for the most part coded authority and action. In 1926, near the end of his life, Claude Monet remembered the circumstances of the portrait\u2019s creation: \u201cI know of only one portrait of Sisley by Renoir. It\u2019s the one he did at my house at Argenteuil, where he\u2019s sitting astride my chair.\u201d This would have been Monet\u2019s second home in the riverside town of Argenteuil, the newly built Pavillon Flament, into which he moved with his family in October 1874. Monet, Renoir, and Sisley\u2019s gathering there in 1876 was undoubtedly the occasion for earnest discussion of the future of Impressionist group exhibitions. Alfred Sisley is a fundamentally Impressionist painting in its freedom of handling and novel treatment of subject. While not intended as a manifesto for the movement, the portrait nevertheless acted as an affirmation of shared aesthetic goals that the three artists had cultivated over a decade and a half.\n\nThough the Chicago portrait would be the last of Renoir\u2019s paintings for which Sisley posed, it was not the first time he had appeared in a painting that implied shared aesthetic views between the artist and the sitter. During the 1860s, he posed for a number of Renoir\u2019s genre paintings. In 1868 he modeled with Renoir\u2019s mistress Lise Tr\u00e9hot for The Couple (fig. 4.3 [Daulte 34; Dauberville 256]), a bold demonstration of the artist\u2019s awareness of the latest fashion trends and his mastery of colorful design. Firm adherents of the plein air school, Renoir and Sisley painted landscapes together in the forest of Fontainebleau during the summer of 1866. The occasion became the subject of Renoir\u2019s first monumental group portrait, The Inn of M\u00e8re Antony (fig. 4.4 [Daulte 20; Dauberville 229]), in which Sisley is joined by fellow artist Jules Le Coeur and an unidentified figure. Sisley, dapper in a white felt hat and dark suit, engages his attentive companions in conversation. On the table before him sits a copy of L\u2019\u00e9v\u00e9nement, for which \u00c9mile Zola had been the art critic until that spring. The presence of the journal likely signifies Sisley\u2019s involvement in progressive art debates of the day. His portrayal as a member of the avant-garde in The Inn of M\u00e8re Antony thus provides meaningful context for Renoir\u2019s representation of him in the same capacity ten years later, though in the later work the point was made through provocative use of Impressionistic brushwork.\n\nMonet, Renoir, and Sisley\u2019s friendship began in 1862 in the studio of Charles Gleyre, where they first discovered that they shared common artistic interests. Recalling the first time she saw her future husband, probably in 1878 or 1879, Aline Charigot said that he was walking with Sisley and Monet on the rue Saint-Georges. Her description of the three as wearing their hair long and causing a spectacle by their appearance belies Sisley\u2019s reputation for sporting elegant attire; in Renoir\u2019s portrait he looks the perfect English gentleman, complete with starched shirt, cuff links, and lavaliere. Indeed, a photograph of Sisley usually dated to the early 1880s shows him meticulously clothed (fig. 4.5). Though Sisley may not have dressed the part of the struggling artist, there was no question about his aesthetic allegiances, allying himself as he did with Monet and Renoir to form a bloc within the Impressionist movement. In 1879 Renoir and Sisley declined to participate in the fourth Impressionist exhibition, choosing instead to send their paintings to the Salon that year (which Renoir had also done the year before). In 1880 Monet followed their example, exhibiting a landscape at the Salon (The Seine at Lavacourt, 1880; Dallas Museum of Art) rather than contributing to the fifth Impressionist exhibition in April. Sisley\u2019s refusal by the Salon jury of 1879 weighed heavily on Renoir, whose portrait Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children (1878; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]) encountered no such resistance. In June 1879 Renoir wrote a letter to Georges Charpentier encouraging the publisher to hold an exhibition of Sisley\u2019s work at the offices of La vie moderne, but this did not come about until November 1881. Possibly feeling betrayed by what he perceived as careerism trumping group ideals, Sisley grew distant from Renoir, eventually becoming so bitter and withdrawn that he preferred to cross the road rather than meet his former friend on the sidewalk.\n\nThough the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel had been buying Sisley\u2019s paintings since 1872, the commencement of the Impressionist exhibitions in April 1874 brought Sisley critical attention and hopes of an improved financial situation, much needed after his father\u2019s bankruptcy following the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. The second Impressionist exhibition in April 1876 also proved salutary for Sisley\u2019s career. His submission consisted of eight landscape views of his home at the time, Marly-le-Roi, located fifteen miles west of Paris near Bougival. They included two winter scenes and a view of the notorious floods that struck in March. The paint could hardly have been dry, but the works were already on the market; all of Sisley\u2019s paintings in the exhibition were borrowed from art dealers, suggesting a growing appreciation of and demand for his work. Indeed, at least two critics of the exhibition singled him out as an artist of notable talent. A sense of Sisley\u2019s rising star is conveyed in Renoir\u2019s portrait, which first appeared as part of Renoir\u2019s submission to the third Impressionist exhibition in April 1877. That exhibition was also the occasion of an ambitious display of work by Sisley. The catalogue listed seventeen Sisley landscapes, eleven of which had owners, including some of the most important Impressionist collectors: Georges Charpentier, Th\u00e9odore Duret, and Georges de Bellio.\n\nThe portrait of Sisley probably remained in Renoir\u2019s studio until it was sent to the exhibition. There is no evidence that Sisley himself ever owned the work. Indeed, an inscription on the original stretcher, portrait du peintre Sisley\u2014par Renoir, displays characteristics of Renoir\u2019s hand (in the formation of the p, for example) and may date from this time (fig. 4.6). The 1877 Impressionist exhibition included Renoir\u2019s masterpiece Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (1876; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 209; Dauberville 211]) and was pivotal to establishing his reputation as the preeminent Impressionist figure painter and portraitist. The portrait of Sisley was one of several to demonstrate Renoir\u2019s ability in this genre. The others he exhibited represented a virtual assembly of the select members of Parisian society who supported him, including many of the same patrons who purchased work by Sisley: Marguerite Charpentier, wife of Georges (1876\u201377; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 226; Dauberville 465]); Jeanne Samary (fig. 4.7 [Daulte 229; Dauberville 462]), actress of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise; and Jacques-Eug\u00e8ne Spuller (c. 1877; private collection [Daulte 71; Dauberville 545]), a Republican politician who had been elected deputy of the Seine in March 1876. The emphasis on portrait painting in the context of an Impressionist exhibition was not simply self-promotion for Renoir; it was also an attempt to establish a new interest in the genre as an art form. Georges Rivi\u00e8re, one of Renoir\u2019s closest friends at the time and his future biographer, provided one of the few contemporary comments on the Sisley portrait, highlighting its importance to Renoir\u2019s development as an artist: \u201cThe series of portraits ends with one of Sisley, one of the establishment regulars. This portrait achieves an extraordinary likeness and possesses great value as a work of art.\u201d\n\nIn claiming that the Sisley portrait was not only an accurate likeness but also artistically significant, Rivi\u00e8re expanded the usual critical discourse surrounding portraiture at the Salon, which was limited in breadth as the genre did not invite progressive approaches to painting. Renoir\u2019s example at the 1877 exhibition also inspired critics close to the Impressionists to reconsider portraiture\u2019s validity as a pursuit for progressive artists. In a brief but pioneering historical survey of Impressionism published as a brochure in 1878, Duret alluded to Renoir\u2019s gifts as a portrait painter: \u201cRenoir excels at portraits. Not only does he catch the external features, but through them he pinpoints the model\u2019s character and inner self.\u201d Duret\u2019s comments suggest that there existed a level of familiarity between the sitter and the artist in Renoir\u2019s work that was unusual in nineteenth-century portrait painting. Sisley\u2019s pose, as if he has been caught in a moment of reflection, is remarkably original, but it also reveals that Renoir looked to the past in developing his innovative approach: Alfred Sisley shares the psychological awareness and spontaneity of pose visible in the work of Frans Hals and Dutch seventeenth-century portraiture more generally (see fig. 4.8).\n\nRenoir did not arrive easily at Sisley\u2019s pose, however. X-ray and transmitted infrared images of the painting show that the artist made many changes to the position of the arms. It is possible that both arms were initially folded over the chair back (fig. 4.9; see Paint Layer in the technical report). But once resolved, the pose must have satisfied Renoir, as he returned to it in late 1877 for the commissioned portrait of the collector Eug\u00e8ne Murer (fig. 4.10 [Daulte 246; Dauberville 547]).\n\nIt was in 1876 or early 1877 that Renoir and Sisley made the acquaintance of Murer, a pastry cook turned artist, who became one of Sisley\u2019s most devoted patrons. Alfred Sisley was among eleven Renoir paintings that Murer apparently purchased in a lot for 500 francs, probably not long after the close of the third Impressionist exhibition at the end of April 1877. This transaction had taken place by early 1883, when the artist approached Murer about borrowing the portrait for his retrospective exhibition, organized by Durand-Ruel and scheduled to open April 1 of that year. But the portrait is not identified in the catalogue of the retrospective, nor is Murer credited as a lender to that exhibition, and thus it may not have been on display or may have been exhibited but not catalogued. Renoir\u2019s request for the Sisley portrait suggests that he still felt kindly toward his friend, though little is known about their relationship during this period. Sisley\u2019s own show of some seventy works, held June 1\u201325, 1883, followed the solo exhibitions of Monet, Renoir, Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, and Camille Pissarro and completed the series of Impressionist exhibitions at Durand-Ruel\u2019s boulevard de la Madeleine location. Sisley remained an important member of the Impressionist circle of artists promoted by Durand-Ruel and kept up regular contact with Pissarro.\n\nThis undated portrait has been assigned dates ranging from 1874 to 1879, but it was most likely made shortly after the second Impressionist exhibition of 1876, for a variety of reasons. First, an earlier date would be inconsistent with Renoir\u2019s tendency in the mid-1870s to exhibit his paintings soon after they were finished. Second, the distinctive stippled appearance of the work, in which short brushstrokes rich with paint were used to create a highly textured surface, is shared by many works executed in 1876 and 1877, including the five other oil portraits in the 1877 Impressionist exhibition. This visually dynamic technique did not sit well with one art critic: \u201cSome of Renoir\u2019s Portraits look all right\u2014at a distance\u2014so that you do not notice too much his way of applying brushstrokes like pastel hatchings and the peculiar scratches that make his style seem so painful.\u201d The comparison of Renoir\u2019s brushstrokes to \u201cpastel hatchings\u201d can most readily be read as referring to the crisscross strokes in the arms and the overall lighter tone of Jeanne Samary (fig. 4.7). The brazen handling of the pale flesh tones in Sisley\u2019s face, where, in addition to fine brushes, the artist used a palette knife to bring up the bright reddish-orange hues below (fig. 4.11), contrasts with the impeccably bourgeois presentation of the sitter and identifies Renoir irrefutably as a member of the Impressionist circle.\n\nIn 1902 Camille Mauclair suggested that Alfred Sisley anticipated the pointillism of the Neo-Impressionists, but the portrait displays little of the controlled construction of form and scientific approach to color that define that movement. Rather, Renoir achieved volume and depth by using a small brush to apply a wide range of colors. This is particularly noticeable in the small directional strokes of the beard (fig. 4.12). In addition, Renoir assigned as much importance to the layering of colors as to their juxtaposition. Around the eyes, for example, he applied the paint using several different methods in order to produce a variety of surface textures, from visible canvas weave to thick impasto that yields a sculptural effect (fig. 4.13). This technique of unifying the entire canvas with a stippled effect is frequently seen in Renoir\u2019s more experimental painting style during the mid-1870s and is especially evident on close examination, where the details seem so gestural.\n\nRenoir\u2019s portrait of Sisley has long been recognized as an honorable tribute to an important friendship and artistic alliance. A photograph of the portrait, reproduced en lettre (in the body of the paragraph), was the opening illustration for a lengthy obituary of Sisley published in the March 1899 issue of the Gazette des beaux-arts. Appearing at a sensitive time following the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg\u2019s acceptance of Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s collection of Impressionist paintings, the obituary included an assessment of Impressionism\u2019s place in art history.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir\u2019s portrait of Alfred Sisley is heavily worked, making use of the various textures afforded by the oil medium. Beginning with a standard-size, commercially prepared canvas, the artist appears to have sketched the initial contours of the figure in blue paint; some of these blue contours also initiated the painting process. Crosshatching and the play of competing textures and colors layered over one another are common throughout the background and the figure\u2019s coat. The flesh tones show the heaviest working, especially in the face, where Renoir employed a palette knife to model the features, scraping away the paler layers to reveal the brighter paint beneath. The paint is often of a stiff consistency and contrasts with more traditional wet-in-wet modeling through its pronounced texture and limited intermixing. For the figure\u2019s beard, the artist used a wide array of colors and very small brushes to create the sense of volume and depth. Lastly, small touches of bright color were added to the beard, eyes, and highlights of the chair.\n\nRenoir made alterations to the main contours of the figure\u2019s body, widening both arms, moving both cuffs, and raising the right shoulder. Evidence in the transmitted-infrared and X-ray images also suggests that Sisley may initially have been portrayed with his right hand crossed over his left across the top of the chair back. The chair itself was also changed: the vertical stiles were moved slightly to the left, and the curved, horizontal rails were tapered and curved further downward on the right side. The X-ray, raking-light, and infrared images show a number of unidentified forms around Sisley\u2019s right hand and on the far right, which may indicate other changes. The work is coated with a thin natural-resin varnish, which serves to saturate the colors and visually differentiate them, especially in the coat, hair, and dark background, but it is not original to the painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 4.14).\n\nSigned: Renoir. (lower right, in dark-red paint) (fig. 4.15, fig. 4.16).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were approximately 65 \u00d7 53.8 cm, measuring from the original foldover. This is consistent with a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size (65 \u00d7 54 cm) canvas; this is also the number stenciled on the verso of the original stretcher (fig. 4.17, fig. 4.18).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.6V (0.7) \u00d7 16.8 (1.3) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThere is cusping around the perimeter of the canvas corresponding to the placement of the original tacks; cusping along the vertical warp threads is particularly pronounced. In addition, the canvas is marked by irregular thread thickness, especially the horizontal threads, resulting in a wide variation in thread density (6.9\u201332.9 threads/cm) (fig. 4.19).\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1972, the original dimensions were increased by approximately 0.25 cm (1/10 in.) on all sides (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 4.5\u20136.5 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.7 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with blind mortise-and-tenon construction and a horizontal crossbar. Depth: 0.8 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: original stretcher (discarded); 1972 photograph in conservation file  \nMethod: ovular stamp  \nContent: TOILES ET COULEURS FINES / REY &amp; Cie / PARIS. / x [5]1 RUE DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD x (fig. 4.20)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: original stretcher (discarded); 1972 photograph in conservation file  \nMethod: stamp  \nContent: 15 (fig. 4.18)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: verso of original canvas (covered by lining)  \nMethod: ovular stamp  \nContent: [. . .] / RE[Y] &amp; [. . .] / PARI[S] / [. . .] RUE [. . .] (fig. 4.21)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe canvas has a commercial ground layer that extends to the edges of the tacking margins. The preparation is smooth and thin, ranging from approximately 10\u2013105 \u00b5m in depth, and partially fills the canvas weave (fig. 4.22).\n\nThe commercial preparation appears to be almost white, with dark particles visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 4.23). The ground remains visible in selected areas of the background, especially on the right (fig. 4.24).\n\nThe ground is predominantly lead white with small amounts of barium sulfate; iron oxide yellow, orange, and/or brown; and associated silicates and clay minerals, calcium-based compounds, and traces of alumina. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nReflected- and transmitted-infrared examinations indicate that Renoir outlined the figure\u2019s coat and major contours; however, microscopic examination suggests that these contours also initiated the painting stage (fig. 4.25).\n\nBlue paint.\n\nNo compositional changes noted in drawing stage; see Paint Layer.\n\nRenoir vigorously worked the paint throughout this composition, using various textures and exercising his ability to manipulate the medium. The work seems to have been executed in a number of stages, probably beginning with Sisley\u2019s sitting for the artist while he established the basic composition, followed by further working up of the paint layers either with additional sittings or later in the studio; the paint layers appear to have mostly dried between painting campaigns. The paint in many areas is rather stiff, paste-like, and thick, reinforcing the textures of the canvas weave and underlying paint with each brushstroke. This is very evident on the upper right, where Renoir began with a heavy zigzag pattern in an ocher-beige color before layering blues and light greens over it (fig. 4.26). These cooler colors, which caught only the upper ridges of the texture beneath, contrast with the warmer undertones and create an interesting play of competing textures and directional strokes. A similar style of paint application, while less pronounced, can be seen in the background on the upper left (fig. 4.27). The crosshatched effect visible in the background, created with heavy strokes of a stiff-bristle brush, is characteristic of the modeling used throughout the work, and a comparable pattern of strokes in much flatter paint can be seen across the coat. As a finishing highlight on the figure\u2019s left sleeve, the artist applied paint in thin, diagonal strokes that run against the curved contours of the arm. Here he allowed the bulk of the paint to load on one side of a flat brush, creating a thin line akin to that made by the edge of a palette knife.\n\nThe flesh tones were heavily worked, especially in the face, where Renoir employed very thick paint that he scraped back with a palette knife in some areas. The artist began these areas with thin strokes using a fine brush and almost-dry paint; the paint in these areas\u2014under the eyes, for example\u2014skipped the depressions in the canvas weave and left the ground exposed. Once the contours were established, he applied strong reddish-orange and blue hues in selected areas of the face, over which he put down thin layers of pale-pink and peachy colors for the flesh; then he scraped the flat surface of the palette knife across the upper, still-soft paint layers, revealing the brighter colors below (fig. 4.28). The stiffer paint consistency overall lent itself to a different kind of wet-in-wet modeling, in which each stroke with a soft-bristle brush picked up less of the surrounding and underlying colors, but more of the texture. This is very evident in the figure\u2019s beard, where the artist seems to have used all the colors on his palette with very small brushes in a series of small, directional strokes that blend with one another to varying degrees. Within the beard, traditional wet-in-wet modeling with paint of a more liquid consistency appears side by side with the stiffer paint (fig. 4.29), and a few bright touches were applied as final details once the majority of the paint was dry. Renoir used similar small dabs of bright color or white throughout the work, for example, the bright orange-reds and white highlights on the bamboo chair in the foreground and the blue, green, and yellow in the figure\u2019s eyes (fig. 4.30).\n\nThe artist changed some of the major contours in this composition, adjusting Sisley\u2019s pose and the space he occupies. The head and the hair immediately around it were established early in the process and the background brought in before the feathering curls on the right were added. The X-ray suggests that there may have been slight changes to the figure\u2019s face and the placement of the nose and eyes; however, the nature of these revisions is unclear. The figure\u2019s right shoulder was raised, and his right arm widened along its outer edge. Comparing the finished painting with the X-ray and infrared images suggests that Renoir altered this outer contour more than once. Similarly, the figure\u2019s left sleeve was also widened along the forearm; this and a slight repositioning caused the elbow to largely obscure the top right corner of the chair. The X-ray suggests that the cuff of this sleeve may originally have been farther away from the face and farther down, which may have affected the position of the hand. The cuff was then moved up toward the face, making the sleeve longer, and the heel of the hand and the cuff in their current position were widened to make them proportionate to the sleeve. The X-ray and transmitted- and reflected-infrared images show other forms near the dangling right hand and on the far right that suggest that the artist may have made other compositional changes; for instance, it is possible that Sisley was initially portrayed with both elbows out and hands crossed over the back of the chair. In the transmitted-infrared image it looks as if the top edge of the figure\u2019s right arm might have been higher than its final placement, while the infrared reflectogram shows the faint outline of his elbow out toward the right edge of the painting. The area around the fingers in the infrared and X-ray images suggests that both hands were once toward the center of the work, possibly with the right hand crossed over the left; as there is little evidence of the top edge of the figure\u2019s left arm in any of the technical images, this idea appears to have been abandoned early in the process in favor of the current pose.\n\nWhile the thin, vertical spindles of the chair were executed over Sisley\u2019s finished form, the larger elements\u2014the vertical stiles and the horizontal rails\u2014seem to have been established before Renoir brought in the dark-blue surroundings. After initially placing the two outer stiles and adjusting the figure\u2019s coat and the background paint, the artist moved the chair slightly to the left. Under normal viewing conditions, the left edges of both stiles pass over the textured, diagonal strokes of the figure\u2019s costume (fig. 4.31). The curved, horizontal rails of the chair back were also subtly altered; in front of the figure\u2019s dangling right hand, the forms were slimmed and angled slightly further downward, to make them more symmetrical with the left side.\n\nStiff- and soft-bristle brushes with strokes up to 1 cm wide; small, round brushes; palette knife for scraping/removal of paint.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, chrome yellow, cadmium yellow, iron oxide yellow-brown, viridian, emerald green, carbon black, vermilion, madder lake, and a second red lake.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence under UV light indicates that Renoir used fluorescing red lake in the flesh tones, hair, chair, and some areas of the coat (fig. 4.32). Cross-sectional analysis reveals that he used a second, nonfluorescing red lake in other areas (fig. 4.33). A small section from a sample containing both fluorescing and nonfluorescing red lakes was analyzed and found to contain madder lake.\n\nBinding media\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current very thin natural-resin varnish (damar) was applied during the 1996\u201397 treatment. UV examination reveals residues of an earlier natural-resin varnish around areas of thick impasto throughout the painting.\n\nThe work has been varnished at least three times in its history. The current varnish replaced a synthetic varnish applied during the 1972 treatment (see Conservation History). During that treatment, a discolored natural-resin varnish was removed. A 1968 condition report notes the presence of cleaning abrasions and subsequent \u201cglazing\u201d to hide them. Such abrasions indicate that the work was treated and cleaned prior to 1968, and therefore the natural-resin varnish present at that time was not original to the painting. In 1996 a very thin damar varnish was applied, locally blotted, and dry brushed to produce a lean surface while maintaining proper saturation.\n\nThe painting has been treated on three documented occasions since the Art Institute acquired it in 1933. In 1968 the work was observed to have a yellowed natural-resin varnish and to be generally abraded, with retouched glazes to minimize the appearance of damage. The abraded appearance noted at this time is thought to be the result of a previous, undocumented cleaning, possibly prior to acquisition. A pulpboard insert was placed between the canvas and the stretcher at an unknown date; however, labels and stamps indicate that the painting retained its original stretcher. During the 1968 treatment, the work was cleaned of grime, and the heavy varnish was slightly thinned with solvents. The more noticeable losses and abrasions were inpainted, and the painting was varnished with three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe next treatment, in 1972, sought to address both structural and aesthetic issues. The work was cleaned of grime, varnish, and overpaint with solvents, then faced with starch paste in preparation for lining. The painting was wax-resin lined and attached to a new ICA spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions. Pretreatment dimensions were listed as 65.5 \u00d7 54 cm, and the replacement stretcher measured 66 \u00d7 54.6 cm (26 \u00d7 21 1/2 in.). Before it was discarded, the original stretcher was photographed, labels were preserved, and stamps were documented with tracings. The work was inpainted and varnished with three coats of synthetic varnish, using the methods and materials of the 1968 treatment.\n\nIn 1996 the painting was treated in preparation for exhibition, and the synthetic surface coatings, inpainting, and residual starch paste were removed. The painting was examined in its unvarnished state by a group of curators and conservators, who decided that the work was not intended to be completely unvarnished (see Surface Finish). While the flesh tones seemed improved by the cleaning, modeling of the figure\u2019s dark coat and the background was obscured in the unvarnished state. The work was lightly varnished with damar, locally blotted, and dry brushed to achieve proper saturation and balance; finally, it was retouched.\n\nThe work is in good condition, wax lined, planar, and stable. The ground layer has darkened slightly due to the combined effects of grime, age, and saturation of the fabric by the lining material. There is cracking in and around more thickly painted areas, including parts of the coat, flesh tones, and background on the upper left, and there is a concentric impact crack near the figure\u2019s elbow on the lower right. Small, localized losses, some inpainted, occur throughout, and the work has some retouching along the edges. The painting has a thin natural-resin varnish, which imparts saturation and an even gloss.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French, late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, gilt torus frame with cast plaster anthemia corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches linked by foliate scrolls and strapwork. The frame has oil and water gilding over red bole on cast plaster and gesso. The sight moldings are burnished, and the ornament is selectively burnished. The gilding is heavily rubbed and toned with a casein or gouache raw umber wash with a gray overwash. The molding is constructed of several woods, including oak, pine, and possibly linden, and is mitered and nailed. At some point in the frame\u2019s history, the original verso was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance, a back frame was added, and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is torus with dentil outer molding; sanded back frieze bordered with fillets; scotia side; torus face with anthemia corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches on diamond beds, linked by scrolls and strapwork with flower heads on a quadrillage bed; fillet; sanded front frieze; ogee with leaf-tip ornament linked by c-scrolls and strapping on a recut bed; and quirked ogee sight molding (fig. 4.34, fig. 4.35).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Eug\u00e8ne Murer, Paris, by Apr. 1883, as part of a lot of eleven paintings sold for 500 francs.\n\nDeposited by Eug\u00e8ne Murer, Paris, at Durand-Ruel, Paris, 1883.\n\nReturned by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Eug\u00e8ne Murer, Paris, 1883.\n\nPossibly sold by Eug\u00e8ne Murer, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, 1896.\n\nAcquired by Ivan Shchukin, Paris, by Mar. 1899.\n\nSold at the Shchukin Sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Mar. 24, 1900, lot 17, to Dr. George Viau, Paris, for 6,100 francs.\n\nDr. George Viau, Paris, to at least June 20, 1912.\n\nAcquired by Herman Heilbuth, by 1921.\n\nAcquired by Howard Young, New York.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, by 1929.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932), Chicago, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, 6, rue Le Peletier, 3e exposition de peinture [third Impressionist exhibition], Apr. 1877, cat. 190, as Portrait de M.

The letter was written in response to an inquiry about an unknown portrait of Sisley by Renoir. The full text reads as follows: \u201cCher Monsieur Joseph, Vous me voyez fort embarrass\u00e9, car \u00e0 la r\u00e9flexion et comme je crois vous l\u2019avoir dit, je ne connais qu\u2019un Portrait de Sisley par Renoir.

That same year Sisley was accepted into the official Salon for the first time; see Explication des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, architecture, gravure et lithographie des artistes vivants, expos\u00e9s au Palais des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es le 1re mai 1866 (Charles de Mourgues Fr\u00e8res, 1866), Femmes allant au bois: paysage, p. 228, no. 1785, and Une rue de Marlotte, environs de Fontainebleau, p. 228, no. 1786. Colin Bailey has argued that, as Renoir was rejected from the Salon in 1866, The Inn of M\u00e8re Antony was probably conceived in the spirit of a refus\u00e9. See Colin B. Bailey, \u201cThe Inn of M\u00e8re Antony, 1866,\u201d in Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat.

The letter is undated but refers to the Exposition des oeuvres de P.-A. Renoir organized by Durand-Ruel at 9, Boulevard de la Madeleine, April 1\u201325, 1883. According to the Durand-Ruel Archives, the Sisley portrait was deposited with Durand-Ruel in 1883, but the date of receipt is not known (see Provenance). Curiously neither the Sisley portrait nor the Murer portrait (see fig. 10) was listed in the catalogue. Colin Bailey has suggested that Murer\u2019s portrait may have served as inspiration for Vincent Van Gogh\u2019s Portrait of Doctor Paul Gachet (1890; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris). Gachet, who cared for Van Gogh in the last months of his life, was a neighbor of Murer\u2019s in Auvers-sur-Oise and completed his medical thesis in 1858 on melancholy for the University of Montpellier medical school. Should Van Gogh have seen Murer\u2019s collection, he surely would have found the Sisley portrait of equal interest in thinking about his portrait of Gachet. See Colin B. Bailey, \u201cPierre-Auguste Renoir, Eug\u00e8ne Murer, 1877,\u201d in Colin B. Bailey, Joseph J. Rishel, and Mark Rosenthal, Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1989), p. 35.\n\nSisley did not attend a dinner on April 2, 1883, following the opening of Renoir\u2019s exhibition, to which Camille Pissarro had been invited, along with Monet, Duret, and Bellio. See Camille Pissarro to Lucien Pissarro, Apr. 2, 1883, translated in Camille Pissarro, Letters to His Son Lucien (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2002), p. 26.\n\nIn May 1883 Pissarro mentioned helping Sisley with his exhibition, and in early February 1886 Sisley sought Pissarro\u2019s advice on the technique of painting fans, which suggests that they remained on good terms. See Camille Pissarro to Lucien Pissarro, May 28, 1883, and Feb. 5, 1886, translated in Camille Pissarro, Letters to His Son Lucien (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2002), pp. 33, 68.\n\nThis is most clearly argued by Colin B. Bailey in \u201cAlfred Sisley, 1876,\u201d in Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Canada/Yale University Press, 1997), p. 149. My support of that date here draws on the evidence presented by Bailey.\n\nPaul S\u00e9billot, \u201cExposition des impressionnistes,\u201d Le bien public, Apr. 7, 1877, p. 2, translated in Charles S.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination suggests that the signature is predominantly red lake, possibly with black, neither of which would be detected with XRF.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_453\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 26, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and the standard size may be a result of this approximation, in addition to the restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out that the canvas has undergone over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Alfred Sisley, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1876 (D117/1933.453),\u201d Jan. 2012.\n\nSee the weave density maps in Don H.

See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cBarbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), p. 66.\n\nWhile very little of this stamp is legible in the transmitted-infrared image, enough can be discerned to suggest that it is the same stamp as that found on the original stretcher. Rey et Cie, Paris, was located at 51, rue de La Rochefoucauld. See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cBarbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), p. 66.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_453\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 26, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMuch of the exposed ground is around the edges, where accumulated grime, abrasion, and saturation by the lining material have made it look darker; however, it is assumed that the ground was originally much brighter.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. The presence of lead, barium, and calcium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected iron oxide, silicates, and alumina. The presence of lead was also confirmed by PLM. See Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, June 5, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. For more detailed results and specific conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, Anna Vila-Espu\u00f1a, and Francesca Casadio, \u201cRenoir\\_1933\\_453Sisley\\_XRFresults,\u201d Dec. 13, 2012; Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_453\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 26, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nDark, carbon-based particles, possibly charcoal, that were found intermittently in a single cross section could indicate additional underdrawing; however, the sample location (near the top edge on the right, in the middle of the apparent window), does not immediately suggest an area of expected underdrawing. This material may be unrelated studio debris. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_453\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 26, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe X-ray also suggests that Sisley was holding something in one or both of his hands, perhaps gloves or a cigarette, in an earlier stage.\n\nPigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, chrome yellow, viridian, vermilion (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); two red lakes (PLM, SEM/EDX); madder lake (SERS); magnesium-containing cerulean blue, emerald green (XRF, PLM 2012, SEM/EDX); iron oxide yellow-brown (PLM 2012, SEM/EDX); carbon black (PLM); cadmium yellow (XRF). PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, June 5, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nXRF analysis of the orange-yellow areas of the chair in the foreground confirmed the presence of chrome and barium. Aside from chrome yellow, the presence of specific elements presents a few possibilities. Barium in this area can be attributed either to the ground or to a possible barium or \u201clemon yellow\u201d paint sold at the time. Two shades of chrome yellow were identified with PLM; SEM/EDX also identified chrome yellow along with barium sulfate, while no barium yellow was identified with either method. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211.

See Kimberley Muir, Anna Vila-Espu\u00f1a, and Francesca Casadio, \u201cRenoir\\_1933\\_453Sisley\\_XRFresults,\u201d Dec. 13, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nParticles of red lake were found to have an aluminum (possibly with some phosphorus) substrate. Two shades of red lake were identified with PLM; the substrate was identified with SEM/EDX; madder lake was identified with SERS. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_453\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 26, 2014; Federica Pozzi, \u201cRen\\_AlfredSisley\\_1933\\_452\\_SERS\\_Results,\u201d May 14, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Identifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.

Based on documentary evidence and discussions with Renoir scholars, it was decided that the painting was probably not intended to be completely unvarnished. In its unvarnished state, the flesh tones improved; however, the lack of saturation in the darks led to a visual loss of modeling and color nuance.
