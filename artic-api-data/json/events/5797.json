Gallery tours are an opportunity to focus attention on outstanding works of art that inspire meaningful discussion.</p><p><strong>What happens on a participatory tour?</strong><br>In addition to providing thought-provoking stories and information about works of art, our educators will make space for tour participants to share ideas throughout the tour as a means of tapping into the collective wisdom of our community. Tour leaders will ask questions and prompt a variety of interactive responses to foster a rich discussion informed by research, observation, and lived experience. We learn more when we do it together!</p><p><strong>Who leads gallery tours?</strong><br>Gallery tours are led by members of the Art Institute staff as well as artists and external partners and educators who are deeply knowledgeable about art, the Art Institute collection, and creative practice. They are dynamic presenters trained to connect people with art in ways that are fun, accessible, thought-provoking, and relevant to our everyday lives. Educators love discussing art and design their own tours so that each experience is unique and enriched by the interests of the facilitator and our visitors.&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-235a9e4c-7fff-f05c-d747-498d53973d02\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br></span></p>",
