    "transcript": "<p>JAMES RONDEAU: This painting is called &quot;The Beginning&quot;.  In it we can see three pale yet distinct lines emerge from the painting's base.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: That was curator James Rondeau.  The painting, which was made in 1946, is one of Barnett Newman's earliest surviving works.  Newman would become known as one of the greatest of the Abstract Expressionists, who aimed in their work to access a deeper knowledge of self and of the poetic sublime in nature.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Newman's signature device was the use of a vertical stripe set off against a chromatic field, a motif he called a zip, and here we see the origins of what would become the zip motif in a painting both titled and structured around the notion of dawn.  So the title at the beginning seems to refer to the dawning of a new day, whereas the zip motifs here, for really the first and only time in Newman's career, are evocative of the rays of a rising sun.</p>\n",
