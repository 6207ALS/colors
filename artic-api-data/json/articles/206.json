There have been more than you might think. The game is surprisingly well represented in the museum, with three chess-playing artworks now on view in the galleries.   Facing the Man Ray Chess Set , 1927, in Gallery 396B, is Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Pocket Chess Set , 1944. Duchamp\u2014a chess Master who once referred to his friend Man Ray as a third-rate \u201cwood pusher\u201d\u2014was famously rumored to have \u201cquit\u201d his art practice in the early 1920s in order to devote his life to playing chess. Duchamp continued, however, to make art, including this \u201crectified readymade\u201d (a found object modified by Duchamp). To make this work, Duchamp retrofitted a standard wallet-sized pocket chess set with red and black celluloid chess pieces of his own design. The work was shown at a notable 1944 exhibition at Julien Levy\u2019s New York gallery, \u201cThe Imagery of Chess,\u201d in which Duchamp was deeply involved. Duchamp considered the Pocket Chess Set to be made as a multiple, but due to the time required to make each set, only about twenty-five were ever made.   The third piece, on view in gallery 262, is Isamu Noguchi\u2019s Chess Table , which Noguchi designed in 1944 for the \u201cThe Imagery of Chess\u201d exhibition. The exhibition made headlines in both the art and popular press, and Noguchi\u2019s contribution was singled out by a Newsweek critic as \u201cthe most beautiful piece in the show.\u201d In 1949, the Herman Miller Furniture Company began to manufacture Noguchi\u2019s table, describing it in a catalog as \u201cideal for a small coffee table.\u201d The table is extremely rare, and only eight examples are known to exist today. Unfortunately, the Herman Miller table was not accompanied by the striking red and green biomorphic chess pieces designed by Noguchi in 1944, now lost, but you can see a replica of the original set here . Come take a look, and let us know if you agree that chess is a legitimate contender for the title of \u201cthe beautiful game.\u201d \u2014Troy Klyber ",
