    "description": "<p>Trained as an architect, the Chilean-born Roberto Matta moved to France in 1933, where he worked in the studio of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/31814\">Le Corbusier</a>. The following year, he met the poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca in Spain. After Lorca was assassinated by agents of Francisco Franco in 1936, Matta began a screenplay, <em>The Earth Is a Man</em>, which he wrote in tribute to the slain hero. The play\u2019s apocalyptic imagery, rapidly shifting perspectives, and emotionally charged language became the principal source of Matta\u2019s visual art over the next five years. The painting <em>The Earth Is a Man</em> represents the culmination of this project and draws on the artist\u2019s earlier compositions, which he called \u201cInscapes\u201d or \u201cPsychological Morphologies.\u201d In these, using a technique of psychic automatism developed by the Surrealists, Matta created turbulent forms that serve as visual analogues for states of consciousness.</p>\n<p>In this powerful, enigmatic work, forces of brilliant light seem to battle those of darkness. The artist spilled, brushed, and wiped on vaporous washes of paint to render the invisible waves of energy that shape and dissolve a molten, primordial terrain. The painting\u2019s visual intensity evokes the tumultuous eruption of a volcano, such as one Matta had witnessed in Mexico in 1941. Exhibited shortly after its completion in New York City, where he had immigrated at the onset of World War II, the mural- size canvas, with its abstract and visionary qualities, enthralled and influenced a new generation of American artists, who would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.</p>\n",
