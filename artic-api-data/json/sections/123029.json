These itinerant groups traveled from town to town, especially during Carnival, with their carts or wagons also serving as the stage (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). Their theater consisted of improvised satirical scenarios acted by masked performers playing stock characters of social types. In the present sheet, a Jesuit priest wearing a tall hat with a curling brim clambers onto the lower left end of the cart. The caricature draws upon satirical representations initiated by Honor\u00e9 Daumier and continued in the anticlerical press (see fig. 3 and fig. 4). Here the priest clutches a plucked chicken, even as his clothing lifts to expose his bare buttocks (which extend onto folio 6F/G). Into these Ensor inserted a horn, a sly allusion to \u201cpassing wind.\u201d The implied cacophony of sounds thus multiplies.\n\nCommedia dell\u2019arte originated in sixteenth-century Italy and spread throughout Europe from the seventeenth century onward. The form took hold particularly strongly in France, where the characters of Pierrot, Columbine, and Harlequin were particularly popular. In the second half of the nineteenth century, Pierrot came to represent the artist or writer, leading Ensor to portray himself as this performer in drawings as well as the painting Christ\u2019s Entry into Brussels in 1889 (see fig. 5). He included other commedia characters in his paintings and used the characters in the ballet he composed, La gamme d\u2019amour (The Song of Love). Ensor was doubtless drawn to the improvisational, exaggerated, and distorted style of commedia performance and to the ways its dialogue and action could be adapted to satirize local scandals, current events, and regional tastes while still using old jokes and punch lines familiar to its audience. The commedia\u2019s narratives and story lines could also disguise political commentary and social critique\u2014so much so that Napoleon outlawed performances during his occupation of Italy\u2014and they continued to do so in nineteenth-century caricature (see fig. 6, fig. 7, and fig. 8). Assimilated into popular culture, commedia and its mocking, absurd theatrics appeared in Punch and Judy, and in Guignol, puppet shows that Ensor might have seen along the Ostend boardwalk.\n\nMusic and dance were central to commedia dell\u2019arte performance: in addition to improvising dialogue, characters sang, played instruments, and danced. Ensor\u2019s wagon is filled with an ensemble of musicians with instruments such as a guitar and a flute; horns including a French horn and a tuba; a harp; and a drum (played by the masked figure in sheet 5I). Two more musicians, one playing a clarinet and the other blowing a shofar, precede the cart in folio 6F/G. The musicians\u2019 exaggerated, primitive, and animal-like features (like those in J. J. Grandville\u2019s satires; see fig. 9) range from mask to grotesque. The two singer-musicians in the center resemble Antoine Watteau\u2019s depictions of Italian and French commedia dell\u2019arte performers (see fig. 10 and fig. 11). They also connect with the chinoiserie figurines sold in Ensor\u2019s family\u2019s store.\n\nThe drawing of the masked figures and musicians extends above into sheet 5I, but the folios align best when their edges are abutted. Additional green colored pencil appears to have been added after the sheets were joined, as there is minimal media along the bottom left edge. A large historical restoration is preserved at center right. SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 Jan Miel (Flemish, 1599\u20131644). Actors from the Commedia dell\u2019Arte on a Wagon in a Town Square, 1640.
