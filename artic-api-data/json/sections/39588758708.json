Her regal bearing and slight smile introduce a sense of something profound and mysterious. The frieze painted on the wall behind her reinforces her inscrutability. In the topmost register appear two rows of enigmatic hieroglyphs; below are a full-length figure of Hina (goddess of the moon) and three heads in profile, two above the sitter\u2019s proper right shoulder and one over her other shoulder. Next to the figure, at the lower left corner, are two gold and red-orange mangoes.\n\nExecuted near the end of Gauguin\u2019s first sojourn in Tahiti (1891\u201393), the subject of this painting is the artist\u2019s vahine (lover), Tehamana. We learn the most about how the artist first met the thirteen-year-old, and how their relationship developed, from his semifictionalized account of this period, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti. In Gauguin\u2019s first draft of the manuscript, he explained that he came to meet Tehamana in the village of Faone, about twenty-two miles from where he lived in Mataiea. After talking with many of her family members, he was allowed to take Tehamana back to his home. Gauguin repeats this story in the second draft of Noa Noa, although he changes her name to Tehura. The couple stayed together from 1891 until he returned to France in 1893. In most of the literature, she is described as his wife, and, if the evidence of her fictionalized self in Gauguin\u2019s text is correct, they appear to have had a monogamous relationship.\n\nThe artist inscribed the title of the painting\u2014Merahi metua no Tehamana\u2014at the lower left. Scholars have translated these words in two prevailing ways. In his important study of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian titles, Bengt Danielsson argued that Tehamana Has Many Parents would be the direct translation from the Tahitian. His rendering takes on additional significance in light of the fact that it was quite common in Polynesian culture for children to have both birth parents and foster parents. This practice meant that children grew up with an expanded support network. Gauguin described such an arrangement in Noa Noa\u2014when courting Tehamana, he was required to curry favor with both her birth mother and foster mother. Another possible translation of Gauguin\u2019s inscription is The Ancestors of Tehamana, which stems from the French title that accompanied the Tahitian one when the painting was exhibited at the Durand-Ruel gallery in 1893 as Les a\u00efeux de Tehamana. This translation leads to another reading of the painting that focuses on Tahiti\u2019s mysterious spiritual past.\n\nEven though this work is the only one that Gauguin inscribed with Tehamana\u2019s name, many of his most famous paintings of 1891\u201393 are thought to represent her. It has been suggested that she is the woman in a rocking chair in his 1891 Faaturuma (Melancholic) (fig. 50.1 [W 424]) and that she is was depicted as the brooding woman seated inside a hut in Te Faaturuma (The Brooding Woman) of the same year (fig. 50.2 [W 440]). Tehamana is likely the forward-facing seated figure seen in two almost identical beach scenes, one dating to 1891 (fig. 50.3 left W 434]) and the other to 1892 (fig. 50.3 right W 466]). She is thought to be the recumbent nude in the 1892 Mana\u00f2 tupapa\u00fa (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 50.4 [W 457]); she may also be the Tahitian Eve in Parau na te varua in o (Words of the Devil) of the same year (fig. 50.5 [W 458]). The figure in Vahine no te vi (Woman of the Mango) (fig. 50.6 [W 449]) may also represent Tehamana. There, set against a background of intense chrome yellow, she is seen holding a mango and wearing a purple missionary dress. Although the women depicted in all of these works bear a striking resemblance to Tehamana as she appears in the Chicago picture, we cannot determine their identities for certain, as in no case do we have the same clear evidence from inscriptions or Gauguin\u2019s correspondence. Further, as Danielsson has suggested, such identifications may be not only impossible but also futile: while it may be \u201ctempting to try to determine which other pictures she posed for. . . . the result of such an investigation . . . is both unsatisfactory and unreliable, because Gauguin was seldom interested in producing photographically accurate portraits.\u201d\n\nTehamana remains one of the most puzzling mysteries of Gauguin\u2019s first sojourn to Tahiti. The literature on Gauguin is filled with references to her, although he never mentioned her by name in any of his correspondence. In an attempt to determine her appearance, several scholars have sought to identify figures in Tahitian photographs of the period as Tehamana based on their resemblance to the young woman in the Chicago work and those in the paintings previously mentioned. One such photograph (fig. 50.7) was published in a facsimile edition of Noa Noa. However, since there seems to be no concrete evidence that the subject was Tehamana, and she could merely resemble the individual depicted in the Chicago painting, this has lead some scholars to question the picture\u2019s relevance. Indeed, no other surviving photographs can be firmly identified as showing Tehamana, so we cannot be sure what she looked like. Even Gauguin\u2019s description in Noa Noa, which describes her as having \u201cslightly fuzzy hair [that] grew like a bush,\u201d is not an exact match to the figure we see in the Chicago painting. In addition, a drawing of a young woman (also held by the Art Institute) exhibits features that resemble those in the portrait (fig. 50.8 [cat. 49] [Rewald 75]), but the faces are not identical: the model in the drawing possesses a slightly narrower face and higher forehead (see Technical Study). Moreover, none of the other drawings from 1891\u201393 that represent females with similarly round faces can be easily related to the sitter in the present painting.\n\nWhen considering Gauguin\u2019s art and writing, one must always bear in mind that he was a raconteur who purposefully, and creatively, wove scenarios with strands of reality and fantasy. Before he introduced Tehura in Noa Noa, he mentioned various encounters with women in Papeete (where he stayed until he departed for rural Tahiti to live alongside natives), including the mixed-race Titi and the androgynous Va\u00eftua. Gauguin wrote that, once he was settled in Mataiea, he painted the portrait of a female neighbor \u201cof pure Tahitian lineage,\u201d but not without difficulty. He described the session, saying that when he tried to sketch her \u201cenigmatic smile,\u201d she fled the room only to reappear one hour later \u201cclad in a beautiful gown with a flower behind her ear.\u201d For him she was a study in contrasts: a woman who was \u201cnot very pretty but attractive in a different way\u201d and who expressed \u201cfear of the unknown and the misery of bitterness mixed with pleasure, offering submission and then revealing a dominatrix in its wake.\u201d It was her dual nature, as he saw it, that he wished to capture. \u201cI invested in the portrait that which my heart allowed my eyes to see, and perhaps more so, what my eyes alone could not: the intense blaze of a repressed force. . . . And even the flower behind her ear was under the spell of her fragrance.\u201d The description he provided evokes the way Tehamana appears in the Chicago painting, with her enigmatic smile and hair decorated with flowers.\n\nWhile Gauguin\u2019s biographer David Sweetman refers to the type of outfit Tehamana wears here\u2014which covered a woman from her neck to below her knees\u2014as a \u201cshapeless Mother Hubbard,\u201d most scholars call it a missionary dress. All agree that Christian Europeans, who colonized Polynesia in the early part of the nineteenth century, introduced the costume: encouraging indigenous women to conceal their nudity, they provided the cheap printed cotton cloth from which the dresses were made. In Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Tehura chose to wear such a dress, thinking of it as European finery that was essential to respectable self-presentation. His description of how she prepared for Sunday Mass reflects her adaptation of the Western toilette to Tahitian circumstances: \u201cShe washed her hair with soap, dried it in the sun and finally rubbed it with aromatic oil. Wearing a gown [presumably a missionary dress] with one of my handkerchiefs in hand, a flower behind her ear and barefoot, she headed to the Temple, repeating the psalms that she would later recite.\u201d Judging by nonnative photographers\u2019 many images of Tahitian women posing in missionary dresses (see, for example, fig. 50.9), Tehura was perhaps not alone in her preferences.\n\nWhile Gauguin was clearly intent upon capturing in the Chicago portrait what he saw as his beloved\u2019s unfathomable character, he seems to have been equally taken with her attire. The artist carefully delineated the garment's construction using large bands of color. He used multiple colors and washes to represent both the white and blue stripes in a variety of curving shapes and sizes, which together transform the dress into the major source of pictorial electricity in this otherwise somberly composed painting (see Technical Study). The large, yellowish (perhaps metal) button (or small brooch) stands out against the field of blue and white, serving to draw viewers\u2019 attention to the decorative collar. Tahitian women, according to Sally Helvenston Gray, \u201cused the yoke as a showcase for embroidery and lace and attached decorative lace collars and cuffs to their Mother Hubbards.\u201d Gray\u2019s point is that these collars were not purely decorative\u2014they both highlighted a wearer\u2019s technical skills and helped to individualize her dress. In Noa Noa, Gauguin describes Tehura\u2019s momentary desire for another kind of decorative finery: a pair of copper earrings. As the episode unfolds, she demands that he purchase the earrings, but he protests, \u201cThis is madness! I will not pay twenty francs for this garbage!\u201d After a tearful negotiation, Gauguin concedes and buys them, but, to his dismay, she all but forgets them just two days later. An X-ray of the Chicago painting (fig. 50.10) reveals that the artist originally included two circles, possibly intended as earrings, which he later covered by extending Tehamana\u2019s hair (see Technical Study). If they indeed represent earrings, these elements are worth consideration in light of this story.\n\nIn Noa Noa, Gauguin offered a generalized take on the Tahitian woman, likening her to a \u201cBlack Venus,\u201d a term he happily offered as a violation of Western notions of classical beauty. \u201cShe is so masculine,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthat to many she seems brutal and offensive: so much so, that another painter in the same environment with a passion for the \u201ctruth\u201d would have concealed this Black Venus\u2019 dangerous charm, because her model denies our very own.\u201d While Tehamana\u2019s loose-fitting European dress was intended to cover her body, in a way the traditional pareu did not, Gauguin made sure its stripes define the curves of her form and the swell of her breasts beneath the cloth. And her eyes, alive with reflections of firelight\u2014as Gauguin wrote in Noa Noa, \u201cfluorescent sparks seemed to flow from her stare\u201d\u2014become windows onto what the artist imagined to be her true, primal nature.\n\nTehamana\u2019s attire arguably is a synthesis, a complex weaving of European influences and the changes they were affecting to Tahitian culture. This is also true of her fan, whose shape and style suggest those typically found in Samoa, which were constructed by braiding together strips of pandanus or coconut leaves (fig. 50.11). June Hargrove has suggested that this accessory serves as \u201ca marker of rank in the South Pacific, [and] indicates noble lineage.\u201d Both of Tehamana\u2019s parents were Polynesian, from the Cook Island southwest of Tahiti known as Rarotonga, and Tehamana herself was born on Huahine, which is located among the Society Islands in French Polynesia, just northwest of Tahiti. It is perhaps her \u201cpure Tahitian lineage\u201d that Gauguin meant to signal by depicting Tehamana with this fan. Technical study has revealed that the artist reworked this detail. Reflected infrared imaging shows several different contour lines that Gauguin drew when first planning the placement of the fan (see Technical Study). He used a mix of techniques to depict it, employing a palette knife to smooth and blend some areas while using staccato brushstokes of bright blue and green to suggest the texture (fig. 50.12). Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory has suggested that with the fan and missionary dress, \u201cGauguin intended to characterize Tehamana as a hybrid of East, West, past, and present.\u201d Arguably, these props also capture a conflation of indigenous and foreign cultures, a pluralism with which Gauguin himself grappled as he sought to balance his own Peruvian and French-European selves (see cat. 25, Commentary).\n\nWhen interpreting this painting, scholars have tended to concentrate on the wall behind Tehamana. Gauguin defined the space with three horizontal zones, which, it has been suggested, represent the intellectual, spiritual, and physical realms. In the top register, two rows of glyphs fill the area around the figure\u2019s head. These outsized symbols were derived from the renowned Easter Island artifacts known as the rongorongo tablets. The glyphs appear to originate from one specific tablet called the Tahua tablet. Scholars have found that Gauguin copied at least ten signs from this source. Once owned by Bishop Florentin \u00c9tienne \u201cTepano\u201d Jaussen of Tahiti, the tablet was sent to Paris in 1887. It appears that the artist procured a photograph of the object (fig. 50.13) during one of his frequent visits to the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris, where several tablets were on view. Gauguin added the photograph to the collection of \u201cfriends\u201d that he brought with him to Tahiti and from which he appropriated forms.\n\nGauguin was interested in secret languages and cryptography, as were many in turn-of-the-century Paris, and the Tahua tablet clearly piqued his curiosity. Neither he nor the natives with whom he lived understood the meaning of its glyphs, and the artist likely made use of these symbols precisely because they were mysterious and unintelligible. Among the glyphs Gauguin depicted in the background, Fr\u00e8ches-Thory has suggested possible meanings for several, including \u201cking,\u201d \u201cbeat the drum,\u201d and \u201cburst of sunlight\u201d (fig. 50.14). These identifications are based on Jaussen\u2019s study of the tablet and, according to Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, the specific symbols may correspond to the original function of the tablets, which were \u201cmeant to encourage interminable chanted recitals of genealogy as related to the cosmos.\u201d We cannot know, however, whether Gauguin would have been aware of these meanings. In addition to their mysterious allure, he likely selected these glyphs based on their decorative appeal.\n\nThe photograph of the Tahua tablet shows that these glyphs are quite small and crowded together. In the painting, Gauguin enlarged them considerably, rendered them in a golden hue, and situated them with enough space between them to make each appear to be floating. This added to the sense that we are seeing phantom-like pictograms from an ancient, and nearly lost culture (see fig. 50.15). The symbols shine in the same light that gives Tehamana\u2019s facial skin a deep bronze sheen. This effect is the result of several techniques the artist used, including scraping, blending, and smoothing with a palette knife (see Technical Study).\n\nIn the middle zone, behind Tehamana, Gauguin depicts figures evoking her very nearly forgotten spiritual ancestors. When he arrived in Tahiti in 1891, he was horrified to find that years of colonial rule had almost eliminated all knowledge and practice of the native religion. Since contemporary Tahitians were by then several generations removed from such understanding, Gauguin gleaned what he could through reading, especially Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 account Voyages aux \u00eeles du Grand Oc\u00e9an. He then used Tehura in Noa Noa as an expression of what he had learned. He wrote:\n\nAt night while in bed, we [Tehura and Gauguin] have long conversations, long and often times very serious. In the soul of this child I look for traces of her long lost past. All of my questions are answered even though her legacy has long been extinct. Or perhaps they have simply forgotten their history, seduced or enslaved by modern civilization and our conquest. These ancient gods, however, have been kept alive in the memory of these native women. Tehura puts on quite a marvelous and unique spectacle indeed, when gradually I see her native gods revived through her, disturbing the veil under which the protestant missionaries believed to have buried them.\n\nThese figures are perhaps more readable than the glyphs because in creating them, Gauguin borrowed from his own repertoire of representations. The profile heads that flank Tehamana, for example, are of the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u (spirits of the dead) that often feature in Gauguin\u2019s work (see, for example, fig. 50.4). The moon goddess Hina (fig. 50.16) is also a frequent presence in paintings and works on paper (see cat. 53) as well as in sculpture; a wood cylinder, with a forward-facing figure of Hina and another female in profile, that predates the Chicago painting (fig. 50.17). The absence of visual examples of indigenous gods, however, prompted Gauguin to reinvent Polynesia\u2019s mythic past by borrowing from other cultures. His sources included examples of Hindu and Buddhist art of Southeast Asia, which he found in photographs of sites and objects that he had brought with him from Europe (see fig. 50.18). Current anthropological theories regarded Southeast Asia as the cradle of Polynesian society, and Gauguin drew on such this thinking in figures such as Hina, which displays a fusion of Tahitian and Buddhist forms.\n\nNext to the depiction of Hina are the three t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u heads (fig. 50.19), which recall the demon spirits that terrified Tehura in an episode of Noa Noa. After returning home late, he found his lover laying motionless and terrified in the dark: \u201cShe took me, with my anguished face, for one of those legendary demons or specters, the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u that filled the sleepless nights of her people.\u201d The t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u represent, as Dario Gamboni noted, \u201ca ghost, or apparition, the supposed spirit of the dead\u201d (see cat. 60). The dichotomy, or perhaps balance, between these two ancestral figures\u2014the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u and Hina\u2014establishes a dialogue, Fr\u00e8ches-Thory suggested, \u201cbetween good and evil or between life and death.\u201d\n\nOn one level, these gods and goddesses represent the mystic past that Gauguin was working to resurrect both pictorially and through his writing. On another, bearing in mind Gauguin\u2019s inscription on the painting, these \u201cancestors of Tehamana\u201d may further represent her genealogy. As Jehanne Teilhet-Fisk explains, \u201cIn Polynesia [genealogy] always extends back to the creators, Ta\u2018aroa and Hina.\u201d Arguably, then, these gods represent another set of parents.\n\nSome have interpreted the lowest band as a table on which two oversize mangoes are placed or as a bench on which Tehamana might be sitting\u2014or both\u2014but there is no evidence to identify it with certainty. The mangoes, located in the lower left corner, are fully defined at the top, with strokes inspired by Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s brushwork; however, they seem to dissolve at the bottom (especially the lowest fruit on the far left) (fig. 50.20). To date, the meaning of these seemingly unfinished forms has eluded scholars. On the other hand, it seems clear that the fruits are meant to signal Tehamana\u2019s fecundity due to their placement just below her name and next to her lower abdomen. This relationship is made more clearly in a slightly earlier work, Vahine no te vi (Woman with a Mango) (fig. 50.6 [W 449]), in which a seemingly pregnant Tehamana holds a mango the size of a giant conch shell.\n\nThe mangoes also symbolize an offering. According to lore of the Arioi\u2014a defunct secret society that worshipped the god Oro\u2014the beautiful mortal Vairaumati became the wife of Oro. He descended to her on a rainbow, and she greeted him with a banquet of fruit. Thus here, like the mythical Vairaumati, Tehamana presents mangoes to Gauguin.\n\nFinally, this painting can be interpreted as a farewell to both Tehamana and Tahiti. Gauguin left her behind when he left Tahiti in August of 1893. While she is quietly composed in the Chicago picture, Gauguin writes of the sad ending to the story of her Noa Noa analogue Tehura:\n\nWhen I left the dock before going out to sea, I looked back at Tehura for the last time. She had cried for several nights. . . . The flower she used to wear behind her ear had fallen, dying on her knees. All along the dock, many like Tehura looked on, tired and silent, their minds a blank as the ship\u2019s thick smoke carried us away, lovers for a day. From the ship\u2019s bridge and for a long time after, we all thought we saw their lips reciting an ancient Maori saying: \u201cI speak to you light breezes of the South and East, coming to frolic and caress my hair; hurry now, go to the other side and there you will find the one who left me here, sitting under the shade of his beloved tree. Tell him that I wait for his return in tears.\n\nLike his semifictionalized narrative in Noa Noa, Merahi metua no Tehamana most probably represents Gauguin\u2019s layering onto the actual of an imagined ideal, a combination of several worlds, each too rehearsed to be real. When analyzing the wide range of elements included in this painting, one can only marvel at the sheer volume of information that the artist absorbed between 1891\u201393 and to which he alluded in this composition. The mysterious glyphs, the Hina and t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u figures, and Tehamana\u2019s enigmatic expression, all lend a sense of mystery and allude to the deep yet lost cultural past of Tahiti.  \nRichard R. Brettell and Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">For Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana) Gauguin used a non-standard-format stretcher and a jute canvas, which he primed himself with a chalk ground that was too thin to smooth down the rough jute fibers. He drew contours for the major elements with charcoal and reinforced them with painted blue lines. The initial sketch included Tehamana (the main seated figure) and Hina (the small figure to the left of Tehamana), as well as the glyphs seen at the top of the composition, but not the ancestor heads (the faces of the other figures seen behind Tehamana). The stripes of Tehamana\u2019s dress were outlined in the underdrawing and subsequent painted sketch, although the folds of the figure\u2019s left sleeve were changed, and those of the right sleeve were painted freehand. Much of the dress was painted thinly, textured by webs of jute fibers that were not held down by the thin ground. The artist wiped back many of the blue stripes as he painted them, to create translucency, and shaded other parts more opaquely with gray and reddish brown. On the whites he modeled the folds with numerous glazes and scumbles of various pastel tints, so that fluctuating, delicate tones, as well as burgeoning form, enliven the surface of the fabric.\n\nDuring the painting process, the face of Tehamana was slowly built up in stages, with relatively thick layers that hid the hairy jute fibers. After an initial lay-in of yellow, the artist worked up the face with shades of green and tan with purple-brown shading. Once this layer had dried, Gauguin applied the final orange and yellow tones, blending them carefully, primarily by dry brushing and occasionally wiping, and he also used the palette knife in spots to smooth and blend. The eyes, when first painted, were yellow with orange shading, pink highlights, and delicate red flickers in the irises, as if reflecting firelight, but they are now deep purple with green irises. There is a drawing of Tehamana\u2019s head in the Art Institute of Chicago with an almost exact correspondence to the head in the painting, which Gauguin may have traced and transferred onto the canvas.\n\nGauguin had first painted Tehamana\u2019s hair not falling behind her shoulders but instead fanning out on the left to hang loosely down the front of her gown. Her hair also rose higher at the top of her head and grew slightly lower on her forehead. Large disks hung from her ears. Gauguin underpainted the earrings with white, and perhaps at the same time applied white in radiating strokes to mask a strip of the dark hair at her crown. Later, Gauguin abandoned the earrings by covering the white preparation with her hair and extended the background to cover the white above her head.\n\nOver the entire background, including the initial drawing for Hina, the artist laid in a translucent layer of olive-tan. He painted the goddess\u2019s loins unclad and then covered them with the thin gray cloth on top. A tall, slender, orange and red headdress sat atop her head, which was painted out with the final pale-blue-green background color. Gauguin first added the two ancestors\u2019 heads to the right and left of Tehamana\u2019s shoulders over the initial tan background. The other orange-faced ancestor to the right of Hina was added still later, painted with a ghostlike thinness over the final pale-blue-green background. At bottom, the fruit on the right was part of the original drawing, while the left one was added later over the background.\n\nThe background glyphs, like the rest of the wall, were made to look aged and worn. They were painted in yellow over the tan lay-in, and the blue-green of the wall was painted around them. Gauguin dulled the wall overall with another uneven layer of tan, then abraded the surface by wiping and scraping to reveal the yellow of the letters very unevenly, so that they seem to glimmer. He added occasional dark touches to serve as scuffs and nicks in the wall. Old repaint mistakenly changed the first letter of the inscription from the M of Merahi to an A.\n\nAt some time in the painting\u2019s history, the canvas was stretched onto a smaller, standard-format stretcher. This probably occurred when the rolled canvas first arrived in France. It was later restretched to its original larger dimensions.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 50.21).\n\nSigned and dated: P. Gauguin - / 93 (near center of bottom edge in dark-blue paint) (fig. 50.22)\n\nInscribed: MERAHI METUA NO / TEHAMANA (lower left, on wall molding in dark-blue paint) (fig. 50.23)\n\nThe blue paints of both the signature and inscription were diluted to the point that they reticulated on the underlying oil paint film. They are abraded with interruptions, possibly by Gauguin himself. In the inscription, many of these interruptions and abrasions were inpainted before acquisition by the Art Institute of Chicago. The first letter of the inscription was originally an M, but the initial leg was partially overpainted along with the edges, then misinterpreted by a restorer and turned into an A. Some faint strokes of the M are visible by stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 50.24).\n\nJute.\n\nThe original size of the canvas was approximately 75 \u00d7 53 cm. This is not a standard size. At some point, the painting was stretched onto a smaller stretcher, a no. 20 seascape (marine) standard-format (73 \u00d7 50 cm) canvas. This was the standard size closest to that of the painted image if both length and width were reduced. In this smaller format, 2 cm of the painted canvas was folded over the left edge, 1 cm on the right, and 0.5\u20131.5 cm over the top and bottom edges. When on the smaller stretcher, parts of the hieroglyphs, half of the first letter of the inscription, and part of Hina\u2019s arm (the part repainted brighter orange), as well as the bottom of Tehamana\u2019s dress, and perhaps the bottom of the P in the signature, were folded over the edges. Folding to a smaller format caused paint loss along the fold lines, which is visible on the X-ray (fig. 50.25). Later the canvas was restretched to its original dimensions of 75 \u00d7 53 cm and the edges repainted. Gauguin had presented the picture to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, and a label indicates that when it was subsequently in the collection of Monfreid\u2019s wife, it was already on its present stretcher of the original larger size.\n\nPlain weave.

Based on thread angle maps, the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp, and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe original coarse jute canvas has been completely covered by the lining canvas on the reverse, and by paper tape, gesso, and paint on the front edge and sides, thus preventing direct visual examination except in a few spots. The canvas was cut at the front edge of the stretcher in preparation for lining. On the X-ray, there are short runs of thicker threads in the horizontal (warp) direction. There are many broken fibers protruding through the thin paint and ground layers.\n\nCurrent stretching: The canvas is not stretched square to the stretcher. Currently, the original paint along the top edge is folded over at the right and does not reach to the top edge at the left. There are two layers of paper tape and sets of tacks, from different stretchings, both postdating the lining. Gesso fill material and paper tape cover 0.5 cm of original paint on all edges. The tack holes from the smaller stretcher are visible along the left edge, 5\u20137 cm apart. The X-ray shows another set of holes in the stretcher underneath the paper tape, which could indicate that the canvas was also stretched on this stretcher before it was lined.\n\nOriginal stretching: There is weak cusping, probably corresponding to the original stretching, with tacks 7\u201310 cm apart. There is a fine network of cracks in some areas that lead in all directions. Beyond this, there are a number of wider, short horizontal cracks that could have been caused by rolling.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Six member, keyed stretcher with two crossbars and bevels front and back. The width of the stretcher bars is 6.5 cm, and the depth 2 cm. The wood contains knots (fig. 50.26).\n\nThe stretcher is old, but probably not original to the painting\u2019s arrival in France. It was more likely first stretched to the smaller format after transport. The painting was probably restretched from the smaller stretcher back to its original size quite early.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Undocumented.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nThere is no evidence of a glue layer by cross-sectional analysis. Stereomicroscopic examination revealed a glossy material in a small loss that might be glue or the result of consolidation or lining rather than sizing (fig. 50.27).\n\nThe ground is so thin (36\u201396 \u03bcm) that it does not obscure the coarse texture of the canvas (fig. 50.28). It was probably applied by brush after the canvas was stretched. While many fibers are embedded in the ground, other fibers project through it and are barely covered by the thin paint layers, creating a webbed, hairy surface (fig. 50.29). The ground is still visible at the tip and edge of the fan handle. It is also visible in areas of the white dress stripes, although most of the white stripes have been covered with an additional white paint layer.\n\nWhite. Appears slightly yellow. Because the ground is so thin, the yellow jute fibers are probably affecting the color. What little ground is visible is also stained by discolored varnish residues (fig. 50.30).\n\nAnalysis identified a calcium carbonate ground in the form of chalk, with microfossils and traces of silicate minerals often associated with natural chalk.\n\nThe drawing of the same size Head of Tahitian Women, Frontal and Profile Views (cat. 49) almost exactly matches Tehamana\u2019s head in the painting and was most likely its source, transferred by tracing (fig. 50.31). The only significant differences are the directional gaze, and a higher forehead and top of the head in the drawing, and an ever so slightly rounder jaw and higher eyebrows in the painting.\n\nThe infrared reflectogram shows an underdrawing of thin lines in a few spots of the painting marking the contours of major elements. Some lines lie directly on the ground, and others were drawn over the underlayers. Lines drawn directly on the ground are seen in reflected infrared around the outer edge of Hina\u2019s hair (fig. 50.32). Black charcoal particles were picked up by the pale-blue layer painted over these lines, as is visible under stereomicroscopic examination, an indication that the artist may have used charcoal for the underdrawing. A drawn line is also revealed over the tan underlayer, outlining the V-shaped ribbon that at some point in the painting process held a round pendant on Hina\u2019s chest. The orange paint of her body covered these charcoal lines, picking up the black particles as well (fig. 50.33).\n\nDark-blue sketch lines were also painted directly on the ground. Sketch lines are visible at the figure\u2019s left shoulder in different positions (fig. 50.34). The slight ridge centered at Tehamana\u2019s brow was indicated in the blue painted sketch, and the line is still faintly visible (fig. 50.35). The glyphs in the upper background were also part of the initial plan, since both the drawing and blue painted outlines are present on the ground.\n\nIn places Gauguin purposefully left the painted sketch lines uncovered, but the initial contours are easily confused with the dark-blue contour lines that Gauguin added later in the painting process. The sketch was left exposed to depict one knuckle on each of Tehamana\u2019s hands, as well as in spots in the dress and at contours. Many of the initial blue lines, such as in the hand, appear oddly reticulated (fig. 50.36).\n\nThe drawn lines appear to be charcoal. The particles dislodged by the ensuing paint explain why so few lines remain visible in reflected infrared (fig. 50.37). Traces of charcoal black particles were found in many of the pigment mixtures identified by PLM.\n\nThe blue sketch lines were not analyzed, but are most likely painted in dilute oil.\n\nAs seen in reflected infrared (1.1\u20131.4 \u03bcm), there are several different contour lines drawn on the ground for the fan (fig. 50.38). It also appears that at one point the fan may have extended considerably lower down the present shaft.\n\nAfter the initial drawing and painted sketch, Gauguin added thin layers of color to block in the different areas. For example, the entire wall behind the figure was laid in with a thin tan layer that translucently covered the drawings of Hina and the glyphs. Tehamana\u2019s face was underlaid with shades of yellow. Tehamana\u2019s dress had been drawn with stripes from the beginning, reinforced with the painted sketch lines, and did not receive a continuous underlayer.\n\nTehamana\u2019s brown hair shines with a variety of colors: yellow, orange and red highlights, deep blue-green and red-brown shadows, and pale-green scumbles (fig. 50.39). It originally fell in more luxurious tresses down the front of her gown. With the combined use of stereomicroscopic examination and reflected infrared images it was determined that on the left side Tehamana\u2019s hair fanned out toward her shoulder, falling down over it in strands, and that her hair also covered most of the left collar and yoke of the dress, with wisps hanging 1 cm below the yoke (fig. 50.40). Reflected infrared clearly shows thicker waves above her shoulder, and a shadow across the collar and yolk where the hair was painted. The presence of this mass of hair is corroborated by analysis and by numerous glimpses under the stereomicroscope of the red-brown layer where not completely covered with the background and dress\u2019s stripes (fig. 50.41, fig. 50.34).\n\nMost interesting are the two round shapes that suggest earrings, revealed in the X-ray (see fig. 50.40). Gauguin underpainted these discs with a warm white, covering the hair underneath (fig. 50.42). This underlayer ensured that light would be reflected back out through the color (presumably yellow) to be painted on top, making it brighter, but he abandoned the earrings in this underpainted stage without assigning color to them, and covered them again with hair.\n\nIn the X-ray there is a bright halo around Tehamana\u2019s head, painted in radiating white strokes (fig. 50.43). This is where her hair at one point extended higher at the top of her head and was painted out with a dense white layer before the background was extended over it (fig. 50.44). The brown hair also extended a little further down on her forehead. Tehamana\u2019s face was originally approximately 0.5 cm wider on the right side. This is clearly revealed in transmitted infrared for the upper cheekbone and in reflected infrared for below the cheekbone. Her features were also initially painted slightly to the right. It is difficult to read the features in the X-ray, but it clearly shows how her lips extended further on that side, and the dark pupil in the left eye is also placed farther to the right (fig. 50.45). Where on the proper left side a red ribbon projects, the X-ray suggests it might earlier have been a rounded flower. And on the figure\u2019s proper right side, above the flowers at her ear, the X-ray exhibits long curved elements that look very much like a ribbon, or possibly a long leaf, placed on this side instead. Initially, the present red ribbon had more impasto, and Gauguin shaded it with dark blue (fig. 50.46). He later scraped it down, however, leaving remnants of the blue shading in the interstices. The flowers on the left side were also vigorously scraped, revealing the top of Tehamana\u2019s ear between the flower petals.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination reveals that the artist had first painted Hina\u2019s lower belly unclothed, with orange shading and a black triangle, over which he scumbled the thin gray cloth. Gauguin worked up the goddess\u2019s body with diverse shades of orange in a blotchy pattern appearing worn down by time, although her face is more evenly covered and complete, giving it, as does its relatively large size, a strong presence. The goddess\u2019s facial features are revealed in reflected infrared to have been smaller, particularly her nose. Gauguin enlarged them all with new blue contours and filled them in with blue-green, giving the eyes a flat, ghostly aspect and the head a skull-like appearance. The goddess Hina\u2019s hair was initially a brighter green and blue-green but was overlaid with tan, which dulled it (fig. 50.47). Hina was first painted wearing a tall and slender orange and red headdress, spots of which are revealed with the stereomicroscope under the pale-blue second layer of the background (fig. 50.48 and fig. 50.49). The headdress extended up in front of the edge of the molding and down slightly in front of her hair.\n\nWhile Hina was drawn on the ground, the ancestor head next to Tehamana\u2019s shoulder was drawn and painted on top of the first tan underlayer, and the more translucent and ghostly orange head was drawn and added later still, on top of the pale-blue second layer of the background (see fig. 50.50).\n\nThe artist painted Tehamana\u2019s face in several stages, allowing it to dry between layers. First, Gauguin applied shades of yellow. He then modeled the face with olive-green, tan, and purplish tan. The olive middle layer is visible in the skips between later brushstrokes, and the purple shading is seen below the nose and lips (fig. 50.51). Over this, the face was worked up with different shades of orange, with the addition of green and red-brown shadows and yellow highlights. Yellow reflected light was blended into the shadows. Smoothing and blending with the knife is seen on the bright side of the face, with dry brushing used below each corner of the eye. Then Gauguin broke up the smooth green at the outside corner of the eye with parallel scratches. On the darker side of the face, the artist completely wiped away the green shading in the center to give the cheek a rounder form, and added hot-orange reflected light at the jaw and corner of the nose (fig. 50.52). Gauguin continued to work the surface of Tehamana\u2019s face by manipulating the paint after it was applied. He primarily used dry brushing to produce smooth, wet-in-wet blending of one color into another, while a sense of the artist\u2019s more direct handling is preserved in diagonal hatching and small fillips of the brush. On Tehamana\u2019s proper right side, the neck has a dark-olive shadow only lightly covered with dark orange, the brush barely touching down. The paint was then partially dry brushed away to soften it further. At the cheekbones it appears that some of the overlying orange was wiped away to strengthen the green shadow. The general effect of the paint in the face is smoothly nuanced, with soft, golden light playing across its surface. The thick layering insures that the fibers of the jute canvas are not in evidence here. The eyes, too, have been layered with different colors. In the lower layers, they are yellow with orange shading, pink highlights, and red flickering in the irises. Over this Gauguin painted the irises a deep purple with dark-blue shading, again with pink highlights, and painted the whites pale green and blue, a cool contrast with the warm colors of the face (fig. 50.53).\n\nOver the ground, the stripes of the dress were first laid in with transparent dark blue and thin white. The added white layer did not change the color of the ground, but Gauguin also used this white to skim over many blue sketch lines, changing them to a lighter blue, and sometimes added a little white impasto (fig. 50.54). After the blue stripes were laid in transparently, he darkened portions or wiped them back to regain greater transparency. Later he created shadows on the blues with opaque grays and reddish browns. On the whites he added many delicate tones\u2014red, pink, yellow, lavender, blue-green, orange, and green (also seen in the orange and green button), as well as blues and grays (fig. 50.55). These tints are sometimes thinly painted, other times diluted into washes or glazes, often layered one upon another, and sometimes wiped back to soften the intensity (fig. 50.56). There are areas of textured impasto in the whites, and the thinly painted blue stripes exhibit a sense of texture, created by the roughened jute fibers that project through the thin ground and are barely covered by the thin blues (fig. 50.57). In the yoke of the dress, the application of color is generally thicker and more even, perhaps because the artist was covering the previous dark hair, which he first painted out with light blue, after which he changed the stripes slightly. The flatter tones here also serve to set off the punctuated lace and function like a more solid pedestal for the head above. Generally, Gauguin seems to have relished variations rather than an even application in this painting, and the result is fluctuations of color, transparency, and warm and cool tones across the gown\u2019s surface.\n\nIn the sleeves, the blue-and-white patterns take on an abstract life of their own, with greater complexity on the figure\u2019s proper right sleeve and an abstract angularity on her proper left (fig. 50.50). Below the shoulder, the figure\u2019s right sleeve was overpainted completely with a white layer. After the white layer, he painted the blue stripes freehand, without an underlying sketch. These stripes were determined by the brushstrokes as they were applied rather than by a preliminary drawing (fig. 50.58). The stripes seem to expand and contract in an illogical manner, but this produces a sense of shifting bulges and lends volume to the sleeve. In the body of the dress, on the other hand, the drawing defined discrete shapes that were later filled in with the brush (fig. 50.59). In the proper left sleeve, a comparison of the X-ray and the final state reveals that different folds were painted earlier, but were changed during the painting process, as Gauguin experimented with portraying concave dips and puckers in the fabric (fig. 50.60).\n\nFor the glyphs in the upper background, Gauguin used a technique that produced an aged, worn quality. The glyphs were drawn and then reinforced with painted blue sketch lines. Over this and the entire background, he laid in a thin, translucent olive-tan underlayer. He then painted the glyphs with yellow and surrounded them with a blue-green wall layer, sometimes straying over the letters. This blue green is more intense on the right side of the composition, while on the molding strip below the color is stronger on the left side, the more intense horizontal band switching positions at Tehamana\u2019s head (see fig. 50.50). The artist lightly added a few purple contour lines around the letters and a few streaks of black to simulate old nicks or stains on the wall. Similar black lines were added on the wall next to the fruit. Last, Gauguin added another intermittent tan layer over the yellow glyphs and blue-green surround. This he wiped, scraped back, and abraded in many areas, giving the whole frieze a worn appearance. Where the tan was wiped off the yellow to reveal its intensity, it glitters like gold (fig. 50.61).\n\nThere is a underdrawing for the rightmost fruit directly on the ground, which indicates that it was part of the initial composition. In painting it, Gauguin relied on a technique he had first used in early paintings. As in the orange tankard in Still Life: Wood Tankard and Metal Pitcher (cat. 1), he laid down a thick, white impasto for the highlight, which he covered with a thin layer of orange. In this way he created a tactile surface with impasto without having to use the more costly vermilion pigment as thickly while retaining the more reflective layering of a thin color over white (fig. 50.62). In Merahi metua no Tehamana he added wet-in-wet diagonal hatching around the impasto on the fruit in different colors, similar to his copy of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s fruit in Portrait of a Woman in front of a Still Life by C\u00e9zanne (cat. 23) (fig. 50.63). He adjusted the fruit\u2019s top edge to make it rounder. The left fruit was painted later, on top of the background layers.\n\nGauguin used small brushes, generally 0.3 and 0.5 cm in size, and a 0.1 cm brush for his signature, inscription and some contour and dress lines (based on width of brushstrokes).\n\nA palette knife was used in the face to blend and flatten the paint and in several areas throughout the painting. He also used a knife to scrape and abrade layers. He used a pointed tool to make scratches in the paint, and a cloth to wipe areas thinner or smoother.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, chrome yellow (both light and medium), iron oxide yellow with associated silicate minerals, burnt sienna, possibly iron oxide red, vermilion, red lead, red lake (possibly two types), ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, cobalt blue, viridian, emerald green, silica, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, silicates, and a little black.\n\nThe salmon-colored fluorescence in ultraviolet light suggests the use of a red lake pigment in the fan details, flesh, and touches in the dress.\n\nOil (estimated)\n\nThe painting\u2019s varnish and the underlying waxy material were analyzed in 1997 and were found to be a natural-resin varnish over a beeswax coating. The wax coating on the paint surface was possibly applied by Gauguin rather than at his request. Since this work was probably completed in early 1893, soon before Gauguin departed for France in July, and he likely would have prepared it for the Durand-Ruel exhibition in November 1893, it is possible that he himself waxed it. The overlying varnish was not applied by the artist, and its gloss and discoloration were visually disturbing. In 1997 the varnish was removed to the degree possible. It was thinned but could not be completely removed because of paint solubility issues. After cleaning, a thin spray of Winsor &amp; Newton matte varnish (ketone resin with a wax matting agent) was applied to reduce gloss remaining from the varnish residue.\n\n1980: When the painting entered the collection, it already had an aqueous lining and a discolored natural-resin varnish. The picture\u2019s borders had been filled, overpainted, and edged with two layers of paper tape. The discolored repaint around the edges extended about one inch into the painting, and small touches were scattered elsewhere. Some areas of abrasion, particularly in the blues of the dress, and losses, particularly along the bottom and left edges, were noted.\n\n1997: The lifting and losses along the bottom and left edges were consolidated. The discolored natural-resin varnish was thinned to remove most of the discoloration and gloss. Old repaints were insoluble and could not be removed, so they were corrected with toning. Small losses were filled and inpainted. Abrasion, particularly in the hair and blues of the dress, was also inpainted. The original wax was not removed, although it had gone cloudy in some areas. These cloudy areas were toned to minimize the disruption of form. A matte spray varnish was applied (see Varnish layer/media) to further reduce the surface gloss.\n\nThe painting is in a very good condition. The lining performed prior to entering the Art Institute collection in 1980 caused flattening and skinning of the paint in some areas. The heat of lining may have caused wax to enter the paint layers, making them more soluble and subject to abrasion. A possible previous cleaning may also have caused some abrasion. Gauguin himself wiped and scraped back the paint, and this technique was accompanied by abrasion that can be seen to continue under subsequent paint layers (fig. 50.56). There is abrasion in the inscription, and the missing spots were inpainted at some point before the picture was acquired by the Art Institute .\n\nThe cleaning and inpainting of 1997, were finessed to bring back as much of the original appearance as possible while maintaining the integrity of the whole without embarking on aggressive cleaning and retouching.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2002): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a late-seventeenth\u2013early-eighteenth-century, French (Proven\u00e7al), late Baroque frame with a bolection profile with engraved foliate scrolling and fleur-de-les miters on a rocked recut bed. The frame has water gilding on red bole over gesso and is burnished throughout. The carved poplar moldings are mitered and joined by sliding angled dovetails. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight exterior side; fillet with rocked recutting; reverse ogee; fillet; ogee with engraved foliate scrolling with fleur-de-les miters on a rocked recut bed; fillet with rocked recutting; torus; fillet with rocked recutting; cove; and cove with rocked recutting at the sight edge (fig. 50.64).\n\nPrevious frame (installation date unknown, removed in 2002): The work was previously housed in what appears to be a first-half-of-the-twentieth-century, American, stylized R\u00e9gence Revival, straight-sided ogee frame with projecting scroll bracketed fleur-de-lis corner cartouches connected by incised foliate scrolls on a quadrillage bed with an independent painted liner. The frame appears to have been water gilded with a cast plaster ornament. The hollow frieze and ornament and incised pattern on the ogee were all burnished. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight outside edge; ovolo; scotia side; ogee face with cast plaster projecting scroll bracketed fleur-de-lis corner cartouches connected by incised foliate scrolls on a quadrillage bed; fillet; hollow frieze; convex sight edge with cast leaf tip ornament. The frame also has a independent fillet-and-cove-painted liner (fig. 50.65).\n\nPrevious frame: In Georges-Daniel de Monfreid\u2019s painting Conversation in the Studio of Corneilla-de Conflent, the painting appears in what was probably its original frame. The work was brought in by Gauguin at his sale at the H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, on February 18, 1895, and subsequently given by the artist to Monfreid. The frame appears somewhat flat in profile in the painting, but more likely it was slightly beveled, increasing in thickness toward the painting, and then beveled down the sight edge. Although it would be difficult to definitively identify this frame, there are French late nineteenth-century frames with this double-bevel profile, often of walnut with a gilded inner bevel at the sight and an outer gilded fillet. These profiles would match frames that appear in photographs of Gauguin circa 1893\u20131894. (fig. 50.66, fig. 50.67, fig. 50.68, and fig. 50.69).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Stamp  \nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: circular stamp in black ink  \nContent: PARIS [through center] / DOUANE [around top] [rest illegible] (fig. 50.70)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: Paper tape on stretcher  \nMethod: circular stamp in black ink  \nContent: PARIS [through center] / DOU[ANE] [around top] [rest illegible] (fig. 50.71)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: paper tape on stretcher, partially cut, partially covered  \nMethod: circular stamp in black ink  \nContent: PARIS [through center] / [DO]UANE [across top] / GE[NE]RALE [across bottom] (fig. 50.72)\n\nInscription  \nLocation: paper tape on stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten script in pencil  \nContent: Chauncy Mc Cormick (fig. 50.73)\n\nInscription  \nLocation: paper tape on stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten script in blue pencil  \nContent: 6[9] 59 (fig. 50.74)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten script in blue pencil  \nContent: 2774 (fig. 50.75)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: printed oval label with number in handwritten script  \nContent: CH.

See Bengt Danielsson, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Tahitian Titles,\u201d Burlington Magazine 109, no. 749 (Apr. 1967), p. 231, who mentions this variance between the editions. Gauguin\u2019s lover\u2019s full name may have been Teha\u2019amana a Tahura; Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cThe First Tahitian Years,\u201d in Richard R.

It is difficult to know whether Gauguin requested that the French titles be included alongside the Tahitian in the exhibition catalogue. At the end of 1892, the artist sent a group of painting to his wife, Mette, in Copenhagen for an exhibition that opened in March 1893; he also sent a letter that included both the Tahitian titles for these works as he wished them to appear in the exhibition catalogue along with his French translations. He stressed that the French translations were for reference only: \u201cBelow is the translation of the titles I have put on the canvases. This translation is for you only so that you may give it to those who ask for it. But I want the titles in the catalogue to be the same as those on the picture. This language is fantastic and has several meanings.\u201d See Gauguin to Mette Gauguin, Dec. 8, 1892, in Maurice Malingue, ed., Paul Gauguin: Letters to His Wife and Friends, trans. Henry J.

See Gauguin to Monfreid, Mar. 31, 1893, in The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid, foreword by Frederick O\u2019Brien, trans. Ruth Pielkovo (Dodd, Mead, 1922), p. 46, no. 9 : \u201cI shall soon be a father again in Oceanica . . . It is true that here it is not bad, for children are welcome and are spoken for in advance by all the relatives. It\u2019s a struggle as to who should be the foster mother and father. For you know that in Tahiti a child is the most beautiful present one can give. So I do not worry as to its fate.\u201d Translation adjusted by the author. See Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cThe First Tahitian Years,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F.

M. Shackelford and Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, Gauguin Tahiti, exh. cat. (MFA Publications, 2004), p. 33. Both Stuckey and Fr\u00e8ches-Thory questioned whether Tehamana, as described in Noa Noa, accords with the woman Gauguin knew in Tahiti and depicted in the Chicago picture. For Stuckey (p. 212) the description in Noa Noa seems to better describe a Javanese woman whom Gauguin had taken as a lover upon his return to Paris and may be a purposeful obfuscation of his Tahiti relationship from his wife, Mette.\n\nWhile the facial features of the figure seen in the drawing are not an exact match to those seen in the painting, the drawing still may have served as a preliminary study; see cat. 49 Descriptive Analyses and Related Works.\n\nSee Paul Gauguin, Noa Noa: Voyage \u00e0 Tahiti, facsimile ed.

This duality is further noted in another passage in Noa Noa (p. 110), in which Gauguin described Tehura as being: \u201cat times dutiful and affectionate, other times mad and flighty. She had two personalities, very different [one] from the other, which changed unexpectedly with a swiftness that was disconcerting. She was not moody, she had an alter ego: She was the child of an ancient tribe.\u201d Translation courtesy of Elpida Vouitsis.\n\nDavid Sweetman, Paul Gauguin: A Life (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), p. 337.

That which distinguishes the Maori woman from all others is that often times she is mistaken for a man because of her bodily proportions.\u201d See Paul Gauguin, Avant et apr\u00e8s (G.

Many thanks to Dario Gamboni for this reference.\n\nBishop Jaussen worked with an Easter Island native living in Tahiti, Metoro Tau\u2018a Ura, to decipher the symbols, which resulted in his 1893 study of the tablet; see Jaussen, \u201cL\u2019ile de Paques: Historique et \u00e9criture,\u201d Bulletin de g\u00e9ographie historique et descriptive (1893), pp. 240\u201370. It was later discovered that Metoro\u2019s knowledge of the glyphs and associated chants and performances was more limited than Jaussen realized, and his study has since been largely discredited.

(J. F\u00f6rlag, 1947), pp. 129\u201367. The gods in Polynesian religion are personifications of various natural elements. Hina, the moon goddess, is Ta\u2019aroa\u2019s celestial mate; Ta\u2019aroa is the creator of the universe. Tefatou, god of the earth, emerged from Ta\u2019aroa. While some consider Tefatou and Ta\u2019aroa one and the same, Gauguin distinguished between the two in his text. See also Tepano Jaussen, Grammaire et dictionnaire de la langue maorie: dialecte tahitien (Berlin Fr\u00e8res, 1898), pp. 111, 144, for more on Hina and Ta\u2019aroa. For Tefatou, see E. S. Craighill Handy, Polynesian Religion (Bernice P. Bishop Museum, 1927), pp. 117, 288. Handy identified \u201cTe-fatu\u201d as the Lord of the Ocean, clearly differentiating him from Ta\u2019aroa, the ultimate creator and father of all gods.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe various forms of infrared imaging do not separate original from repaint.\n\nJute was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification (PLM); see Inge Fiedler, see \u201c1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 30, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSize judged from the extent of original paint visible on the X-ray, and the outer barb of paint where visible. The size is somewhat smaller than the size Gauguin most often used at this time, which was the no. 30 portrait (figure) format of 92 \u00d7 73 cm.\n\nNeither 75 nor 53 cm are lengths for standard-size stretchers. The closest standard-format sizes are 73 \u00d7 54 cm (no. 20 landscape [paysage], but that would have involved increasing one dimension and reducing the other. See chart of standard sizes available from [Bourgeios A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888/Lefranc et Cie. in 1889, etc.], reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Custom stretchers were easily obtained from color merchants, given twent-four hours\u2019 notice. Bourgeios A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888/ Lefranc et Cie. in 1889. For other non-standard-size Gauguin paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s Collection, see the entry for Gauguin\u2019s Te burao (The Hibiscus Tree) (cat. 28), Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (cat. 72), and No te aha oe riri (Why Are You Angry?) (cat. 90).\n\nUnless the label was added at a later date.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See C. Richard Johnson, Jr., Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Paul Gauguin, The Ancestors of Tehamana or Tehamana Has Many Parents, 1893 (W497/1980.613) December 2014.\u201d\n\nGesso was added so the paper tape would adhere smoothly over the edge. Paper tape was added, usually after lining, to tidy the edges, where there is often paint loss, and to hold down the tacking margins on the sides and verso.\n\nGauguin\u2019s original stretcher may have been off-square.\n\nIn 2013, the top layer of paper tape was removed from the front surface on all but the right side.\n\nConsidering that this was one of the last pictures painted before Gauguin\u2019s return to France in July 1893, the paint may still have been somewhat flexible, and might not have cracked as markedly as is often the case with rolling.\n\nGauguin himself may have insisted upon it before the 1893 Durand-Ruel exhibition. A label on the verso includes the name of Mme de Monfreid, who owned the painting from 1929 to 1937, so the stretcher probably dates from that period or before, when it was owned by her husband. (It is always possible this is an ex-collection label dating later.)\n\nThere are no manufacturer or supplier marks on the non-standard-format stretcher bars, and Gauguin stretched and primed the canvas himself, since jute was not a commercial artist\u2019s canvas.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 30, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. Since the tacking edges are missing there is no proof that the canvas was primed on the stretcher, but this was Gauguin\u2019s usual practice.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and electron microprobe analysis. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 30, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn the painting, like the drawing, the top of the head was also initially higher, but differing from the drawing, the right side of the face was initially wider. It is also possible that another similar drawing was the source for both the museum\u2019s painting and drawing.\n\nThe paint appears to have shrunk away from granules in the ground, that have since been flattened, perhaps with the heat of lining or by solvents in cleaning. The pattern goes under later layers so it formed during the painting process, whether or not granules may have been flattened later.\n\nWoman in front of a Still Life by C\u00e9zanne (cat. 23), No te aha oe riri (Why Are You Angry?) (cat. 90), and Polynesian Woman with Children (cat. 122) also have a charcoal underdrawings, while most other works examined have an underlying graphite sketch.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 30, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA review of Gauguin\u2019s paintings by the author shows that the hair of female figures is usually shown behind their shoulders. The exposure of long tresses is more likely to be seen in drawings and in more personal paintings, such as the portraits of his lovers, for example, Vahine no ti vi (Woman of the Mango) (1892; Baltimore Museum of Art [W 449]), or in his portrayals of Eve, as seen in Te nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (1892; Ohara Museum of Art, Kurashiki [W 455]) and Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (1892; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. [W 458]).\n\nGauguin wrote a story about Tehamana and a pair or earrings in Noa Noa (see Commentary).\n\nThe dark hair is visible under the white layer and the glyphs have been extended where the hair once was.\n\nThe dark-blue shading on the present red ribbon has been partially abraded so that it only remains in the interstices of the brushwork that now appears flat. Gauguin could have done this on purpose by wiping and scraping the ribbon to soften the form, or it might have been over-cleaned and flattened in a later restoration. The flower on the left side was scraped by the artist to reveal the top of the ear, perhaps lending greater credence to the idea that Gauguin scraped both sides.\n\nIt may have been based on the headdresses seen in the bas-relief from Borobudur, or recalled from the Javanese dancers at the Universal Exposition of 1889. It is similar to that on the figure from Angkor Wat that Gauguin had drawn at that time.\n\nThat this is Gauguin\u2019s wiping rather than later abrasion, is most likely because Gauguin painted other translucent layers over his wiping.\n\nThis anomalous white layer on the sleeve is represented on the X-ray by an even light layer that is denser than the overlying stripes.\n\nA similar centering of the figure with bands of crossing intensity is seen in Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (cat. 72) with crossing light and dark pinks behind the central female figure.\n\nPigments were identified by PLM and SEM/EDX: lead white, zinc white, chrome yellow (both light and medium), iron oxide yellow, burnt sienna, possible iron oxide red, vermilion, red lead, red lake (possibly two types) PLM; lead white, some zinc white, iron oxide yellow with silicate minerals, vermilion, red lead, ultramarine blue, emerald green, chromium-based pigment (lead chromate and/or chromium oxide green-viridian), calcium-based white, barium sulfate, silicates and silica SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report, dated June 30, 2016,\u201d on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlthough the type of red lake was not identified in this painting, PLM identification suggests two different forms. SEM/EDX analysis determined an aluminum and phosphorous substrate for the red lakes that fluoresces a bright salmon-red under ultraviolet light. See Inge Fiedler, \"1980\\_613\\_Gauguin\\_Tehamana\\_analytical\\_report,\" June 30, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.

Gauguin\u2019s intent to have the surfaces of his paintings waxed was reflected earlier in his letter to Monfreid: \u201cVous les laverez avec soin et beaucoup de precautions pour ne pas enlever la peinture et la preparation et vous cirerez\u201d (You will wash them [the paintings] carefully and with many precautions so as not to remove the paint and the preparation and [then] you will wax [them]).

The abrasion to the signature and date, on the other hand, could well be due to their proximity to the bottom edge, especially when the picture was folded to a smaller format.\n\nSee Don H.
