    "description": "<p>Here Daumier humorously described the love triangle between Alexander the Great, his mistress Campaspe, and the painter Apelles. On Alexander\u2019s request, Apelles painted Campaspe in the nude as Aphrodite. In the process, Apelles became so madly in love with her that Alexander kept the painting and gave the artist Campaspe as a gift in return. Even though Apelles would be known as the greatest painter of antiquity, in Daumier\u2019s rendition Campaspe seems horrified to be trading her powerful warrior for a puny artist. Daumier\u2019s inscription suggests Alexander used Apelles\u2019s desire for Campaspe as a convenient opportunity to dispose of his mistress.</p>\n",
