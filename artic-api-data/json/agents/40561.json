    "description": "<p>Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s technically groundbreaking body of drawings and prints had a profound and lasting influence on the development of European art. Initially trained as a goldsmith by his father, D\u00fcrer was schooled in painting by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Michel+Wolgemut\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Wolgemut</a> and began making works on paper in the 1490s.&nbsp;</p><p>Born in the German town of Nuremberg\u2014a prosperous free city of the Holy Roman Empire and a center of commerce, book printing, and humanist learning\u2014D\u00fcrer grew up in a culturally and artistically stimulating environment. He further expanded his intellectual horizons by traveling twice to Italy in his youth and once to the Netherlands as a mature artist. In addition to several paintings, D\u00fcrer produced works on paper of unparalleled sophistication. He worked in drawing, woodcut, and engraving\u2014even briefly trying his hand at the less common techniques of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53306/the-desperate-man\" target=\"_blank\">etching</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53301/the-holy-family-with-st-john-the-magdalen-and-nicodemus\" target=\"_blank\">drypoint</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Durer\u2019s drawings, such as the Art Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23506/young-bull\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Young Bull</em></a>, are remarkable for their realism and refined penmanship. His unprecedentedly meticulous engravings, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28240/nemesis\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nemesis</em></a>, precisely conveyed surfaces, textures, and subtle effects of light. His wooducts\u2014like his famous <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/55330/the-four-horsemen-of-the-apocalypse-from-the-apocalypse\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Apocalypse</em></a><em> </em>series or <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/197566/the-men-s-bath\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Men\u2019s Bath</em></a>\u2014were ambitious in terms of size, graphic complexity, and the variety and novelty of the subjects depicted. The Art Institute holds a comprehensive collection of D\u00fcrer\u2019s prints that includes some rare and extremely fine impressions. </p>",
