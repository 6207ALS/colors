    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>The earliest examples of Kruger\u2019s work in the exhibition are her \u201cpasteups,\u201d which demonstrate the analog cut-and-paste aesthetic ubiquitous to commercial design in the 1980s and 1990s and reveal her photomechanical method for producing the iconic work she is known for today. Kruger\u2019s pre-digital works\u2014as she now calls them\u2014tackle monumental topics like gender, class, race, economy, history, desire, voyeurism, and fact vs. fiction on a small scale. Black-and-white images of a the profile of a female statue, an erupting volcano, two girls flexing their muscles, demolished houses, and a leopard cub are paired with the following phrases: \u201cYOUR GAZE HITS THE SIDE OF MY FACE, YOUR MANIAS BECOME SCIENCE, WE DON\u2019T NEED ANOTHER HERO, MONEY TALKS, MAKE MY DAY,\u201d among other examples.</p>\n",
