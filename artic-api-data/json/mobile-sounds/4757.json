    "transcript": "<p>May Flower Child</p>\n<p>For a year I have wondered what the truth is<br>I\u2019ve searched in every garden that bares fruits of knowledge<br>Looked at their white picket fences\u2019 painted with promises of a bright future I traced<br>my steps to a mirage of the yellow brick road<br>And wound up at a cemetery filled with black bodies<br>I read their tombstones till my mind was filled with too many<br>I learned why the weeping willows weep<br>As I listened to the voices\u2019 of people I loved debate life</p>\n<p>Both of its creation and its expiration<br>I grew tired so I sat in a chair built from the roots of a tree that bares my ancestors names<br>Planted my feet in the soil lying beneath me<br>And looked forward at the paths that lay before me<br>One with my own memorial and another filled with roadblocks meant to make me stumble I continued to sit with tears swelling in my eyes until I was drowning in a sea of my own creation I didn\u2019t fight back in fear of what I would see when I came up for air<br>Then I heard the voices\u2019 of lost souls say to me</p>\n<p>Calm the roaring seas that send waves crashing into the crevices\u2019 of your mind<br>Sit back and try to keep your head above the water<br>Let the waves hear the unwavering resilience in the stillness of your voice<br>And command them to stop<br>Then guide your eyes towards the horizon that awaits you<br>Deliver yourself from somber thoughts that cloud your mind<br>guide yourself back to shore<br>And when you feel the tides calling you back<br>Almost close enough to pull you under them again<br>Remind yourself that</p>\n<p>Success is not found, it is grown like the flowers that spring in May after April showers<br>It is tended to like the land we walk on<br>Nurtured in the garden of life<br>Cultivated by extraordinary hands that are willing to get dirt on them<br>Its roots are buried beneath soil as dark as our skin<br>Providing the necessary nutrients to sustain life<br>Success is created with intention, love, and dedication<br>It does not knock at your door<br>But rather waits for you to sit and lend an ear to its whispering willows<br>Who speak words of peace and guidance</p>\n<p>So open your eyes child and take a seat in your garden<br>Make it bloom with flowers that remind you of summer sunsets<br>Take in the elements of the earth and create a life that feels as touching as a cool breeze under<br>a blue sky<br>As lovely as the vision of sitting in a field of blooming flowers<br>And as joyous as kisses on your legs from tall grass</p>\n",
