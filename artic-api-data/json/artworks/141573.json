    "description": "<p>Following the premature death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, his generals, friends, and heirs engaged in forty years of wars over his empire. Lysimachus (reigned 323\u2013281 BCE), one of Alexander\u2019s companions and bodyguards, used the king\u2019s image on his own coins in order to cast himself in the role of successor and legitimize his claim to the kingdom of Thrace. Alexander, responsible for establishing the conventions of royal portraiture, is depicted in his preferred manner: youthful and clean-shaven, with long locks of hair rising above his forehead and eyes cast upward. Additionally, he is shown with horns curling around his ears. These \u201chorns of Ammon\u201d symbolize Alexander\u2019s claim that he was the son of the Egyptian god Ammon\u2014a claim reportedly confirmed by the oracle at the sanctuary of Zeus-Ammon at Siwa, Egypt.</p>\n<p>On the reverse of the coin, Lysimachus exerts his own royal autonomy by naming himself \u201cking.\u201d The goddesses Athena and Nike (Greek for \u201cvictory\u201d) crown his name with laurels, which symbolized victory or honor. The lion on the shield at Athena\u2019s side references Lysimachus\u2019s famous exploit of killing a lion with his bare hands and reinforces his association with Alexander, who used the skin of the Nemean lion as a symbol of power and courage.</p>\n",
