When Whistler exhibited Arrangement in Black and Gold: Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac (YMSM 398; The Frick Collection, New York) (\u201cMarketing the Lithographs,\u201d fig. 5) at La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Des Beaux-Arts in May 1894, the portrait proved a great critical success, and the artist was approached by the publishers of several periodicals interested in reproducing it, including the prestigious Gazette des beaux-arts. Whistler apparently granted his permission for the French journal to publish a reproduction, and set to work on a lithographic version in the late summer of 1894. He and his wife, Beatrix, each executed lithographic transfer drawings of the portrait on thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Gazette des beaux-arts must have engaged Henri Charles Gu\u00e9rard to make an etching after the Montesquiou portrait\u2014probably because Whistler had, in his own words, \u201crefused entirely, when first asked, to do anything myself.\u201d The artist was \u201cfurious\u201d when he saw Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s etching (fig. 85a), and, as he later wrote to T. R. Way, he \u201cmade them throw out his plate on the promise of a drawing of my own.\u201d\n\nPerhaps feeling anxious to produce his own reproduction as soon as possible, Whistler took his transfer drawing (along with two by Beatrix) to Lemercier\u2019s for transferring and printing. Careful comparison of the three resulting images reveals that there is some correspondence in outline and size between them, indicating that Beatrix may have used the translucent transfer paper to trace the outline of Montesquiou\u2019s figure from another source, namely her husband\u2019s lithograph. An alternate possibility\u2014that both Whistler and Beatrix traced their images from a third source\u2014is raised by two proof sheets bearing photographic reproductions of the Montesquiou painting found among Whistler\u2019s papers in Glasgow University Library. The dimensions of the figure in one of these reproductions correspond to the basic outlines of the three lithographic variants produced by the Whistlers.\n\nIn any event, Whistler was not satisfied with the printed results, and he did not submit an impression to the Gazette des beaux-arts as a substitute for the Gu\u00e9rard etching. Instead of giving up the idea entirely, however, he seemingly decided to abandon this stone and begin another version with the Ways (see cat. 85).\n\nThe existence of the two lithographs by Beatrix Whistler has long complicated the cataloguing of Whistler\u2019s Count Robert de Montesquiou, No. 2. Way (1896, 1905) catalogued one of her images (Way 139) as the work of Whistler\u2019s hand, and Edward Kennedy perpetuated the error in his revised catalogue of 1914. As late as 1975, Levy catalogued and illustrated both of Beatrix\u2019s Montesquiou lithographs (Levy 132, 134) as versions drawn by Whistler himself. Collectors, dealers, and museums have been misled not only by these errors of cataloguing, but also by Way\u2019s description of the \u201cvigorous down strokes\u201d in Count Robert de Montesquiou,No. 2 (Way 138); both of Beatrix\u2019s images (fig. 84a and fig. 84b) demonstrate more emphatic patterns of \u201cdown strokes\u201d than Whistler\u2019s lithograph. In addition to their pronounced vertical strokes, Beatrix\u2019s images are easily recognizable because neither reproduces the butterfly signature that is present on the canvas itself, and which was repeated in Whistler\u2019s lithographic rendering of it.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), grayish ivory China paper (360 \u00d7 332 mm), signed; grayish ivory China paper (364 \u00d7 294 mm); MWC, grayish ivory China paper (356 \u00d7 265 mm).

(New York: The Frick Collection , 1995), esp. pp. 108\u201319.\n\nThe Art Journal and the Figaro Salon were also interested in publishing reproductions; Thomson to Whistler, 27 April 1894, GUL T151. A relief half-tone, made using a photograph, appeared as an illustration to Charles Whibley\u2019s article \u201cArt and Mr. Whistler\u201d in The Art Journal 46, no. 120 (December 1894), p. 361.\n\nLetter 92.\n\nLetter 92. Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s reproduction, an etching with drypoint and roulette work, was finally published after Whistler\u2019s death in the Gazette des beaux-arts, 4th p\u00e9r., 30 (November 1903), in an article by Pascal Fortuny, \u201cNotes sur James Whistler,\u201d pp. 381\u201390. Gu\u00e9rard\u2019s image was published again the following year in the deluxe edition of Th\u00e9odore Duret\u2019s Histoire de J. McN. Whistler et de son oeuvre (Paris, 1904), opp. p. 174. The plate size of the Gu\u00e9rard etching is 235 \u00d7 109 mm; this is close to the overall image size of Whistler\u2019s lithograph, suggesting that the format was specified by the periodical.\n\nInez Addams, an apprentice at the Acad\u00e9mie Carmen, alerted Whistler in September 1901 that unauthorized impressions of Count Robert de Montesquiou, No. 2 were being sold in Paris. The artist\u2019s reply of 20 September 1901 to Inez Addams confirmed the fact that the printer had been Lemercier; GUL A85. On orders from Whistler, Clifford Addams located three stones (cat. 84, cat. 96, and cat. 170) and had them destroyed sometime in 1902; GUL R13. Two canceled impressions of this lithograph were left to the University of Glasgow in Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s estate.\n\nWay must have been referring to Beatrix Whistler\u2019s lithographs and to Whistler\u2019s Count Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac, No. 2 when he wrote in 1912 that he had \u201cseen two or three other beginnings he made with the same purpose,\u201d i.e. for reproduction in the Gazette des beaux-arts; Way (1912), p. 106.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 84, only state.
