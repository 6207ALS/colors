Thomson had taken an interest in the artist\u2019s work for many years and had organized the very successful retrospective of his paintings at the Goupil Gallery in the spring of 1892. He had served as editor of The Art Journal since November 1892 and had already published one of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81), in the December 1894 issue of the periodical.\n\nWhistler probably made the transfer drawing of Evelyn when he visited the Thomson family in January 1896 at their home outside London. On January 23 he wrote to Thomson thanking him for \u201cmy day in the country\u201d and telling him how pleased everyone was with the portrait of his \u201clittle bairn.\u201d Indeed, he reported that he had been told that he could \u201cmake [his] fortune\u201d doing similar lithographic portraits to order.\n\nIn the same letter, writing as though the idea had been broached previously, Whistler discussed the possibility of publishing the lithograph in The Art Journal and indicated that the Ways would be willing \u201cto print for the Art Journal at once\u2014upon the same conditions as here to fore.\u201d Hard pressed for cash, the artist explained that it was a matter of some urgency that the publishers, Messrs. Virtue, send him payment for the lithograph \u201cdirectly they see the lovely proof!\u201d He also wrote that he was sending a proof of Little Evelyn to the Fine Art Society, presumably for addition to his exhibition there. The image of Evelyn Thomson must have found favor with the directors of the Fine Art Society, for by February 16 they had placed an order with the Ways for twenty impressions. T. R. Way overlooked this order when he listed only fifteen impressions of Little Evelyn in the second edition of his catalogue (1905). Twenty-one impressions, the majority signed in graphite, remained in the artist\u2019s estate when he died.\n\nThere is a proof in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, with touches of lithographic crayon added to the face and hair of the little girl, suggesting that Whistler contemplated making alterations to the image. In the end, however, he must have been satisfied with the portrait as it was first put on stone, for no revisions were made. The lithograph eschews the sentiment and elaborate staging that so often characterize Victorian portraits of children. As Joseph Pennell wrote in the descriptive paragraph that accompanied the lithograph in The Art Journal, Whistler \u201crelied for success upon no fancy title, no pathetic addition of dead birds or bursting bubbles; his treatment was simple and uncompromising as that of Velasquez in his Don Carlos and his youthful Infantas.\u201d\n\nA few of the hand-printed impressions pulled by Thomas Way from the original stone were printed on the distinctive cream laid paper used for The Art Journal edition. These proofs may be differentiated from the prints pulled within the edition by the absence of the legend, their large sheet size, and because they are likely to be signed in graphite with the artist\u2019s butterfly.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (287 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (290 \u00d7 195 mm), signed; SC, cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 219 mm), signed.

Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (195 \u00d7 158 mm), signed; NGA, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 229 mm), signed.\n\nPublished edition.The periodical edition was machine printed from supplementary stones by Thomas Way for The Art Journal. The lithograph appeared in the March 1896 issue; it was titled Evelyne in the table of contents and in Joseph Pennell\u2019s descriptive note on page 89. Impressions for the periodical edition were printed on cream laid paper, which has often darkened to buff or tan. The recto of the paper has a smooth surface, while the verso bears a distinct pattern of laid and chain lines. These proofs are generally coarser and grainier than those pulled from the original stone, and many have been trimmed to remove the printed legend.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid paper (336 \u00d7 256 mm), with legend, rebound. Glasgow: GUL, tan laid paper (326 \u00d7 255 mm), with legend, rebound; HAG, tan laid paper (319 \u00d7 252 mm).

Washington: LC, tan laid paper (314 \u00d7 239 mm); NGA, buff laid paper (292 \u00d7 198 mm).\n\nRemarks: Periodical impressions are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, BPL and MFA; Brooklyn, TBM; Cambridge, Mass., FAM; Cleveland, CMA; New York, MMA and NYPL; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.

By that time, however, Whistler\u2019s enthusiasm for such portraits had diminished, and he asked Huish to refrain from publishing the notice; Whistler to Huish, [9 March 1896], GUL LB8/19. See also cat. 147.\n\nA list of \u201csales to date\u201d was sent to Whistler by the Fine Art Society on 7 March 1996; app. III.3. It included sales made during the exhibition and some made after it closed. Two impressions of Little Evelyn appear on the list. It is not clear when the exhibition closed officially, for it was extended at least once; see Ernest Faulkner Brown to Whistler, 20 January 1896, GUL F268. Thus, it is impossible to know whether the portrait was actually added to the exhibition or whether it was simply displayed in the gallery after the show closed.\n\nIn a letter to Whistler of 16 February 1896, T. R. Way wrote that the firm had exhausted its supply of old paper and suggested that \u201cLittle Evelyn would look charming on the Japaneese [sic] or the Van Gelder\u201d; letter 165. He then asked for the artist\u2019s decision on the paper and wrote that when the matter was clarified the printers could \u201cpull your own and those other 20 right off.\u201d This remark makes it clear that the Ways intended to pull more than the twenty impressions ordered by the Fine Art Society.\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1984), p. 48.\n\nJoseph Pennell, \u201cEvelyne,\u201d The Art Journal 48, no. 135 (March 1896), p. 89.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 146, only state.
