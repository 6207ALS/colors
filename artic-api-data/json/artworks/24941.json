The artist has said that at SAIC he was a \u201crestless and undisciplined student\u201d who \u201cwanted action not [an] education.\u201d Grooms spent most of his time at SAIC in the library, studying the art of Francis Bacon, Jean Dubuffet, and Bernard Buffet. His time at the school came to an abrupt end when, as the artist explained, \u201cOne day I walked out leaving everything in my locker.\u201d Recognized for his lively depictions of urban life, in this collage Grooms portrayed a favorite motif, a crowded city street.</p>\n",
