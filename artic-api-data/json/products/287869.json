    "description": "<p>Built in 1923, The Storer House was one of four textile block homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright used the textile block motif in decomposed granite and concrete to visually unify the home with the hillside it was built in to create the impression that the home was a man-made extension of the landscape.</p>\n<p>Builders of the Storer Textile block will gain an appreciation for the detail and design the textile block added to this residence.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assembled Dimensions:</strong> 8\" W x 6.25\" L x 2.5\" H</li>\n</ul>",
