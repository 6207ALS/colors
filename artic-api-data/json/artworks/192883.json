    "description": "<p>Joshua Mosley\u2019s stunning, often cryptic work, which involves a labor-intensive combination of drawing, high-definition video, photography, and sculpted stop-motion figures, has redirected the leading edge of animation technology away from its origins in collective production models and commercial applications, and into the visionary realm of the individual artist and the fine-art short film.<br>The dialogue in <em>dread</em> is loosely based on the artist\u2019s reading of Blaise Pascal\u2019s <em>Pens\u00e9es</em> (1670) and Jean-Jacques Rousseau\u2019s <em>Emile</em> (1762). Mosley was interested in the way that both texts \u201cpresent the difficulty of resolving the human relationship to nature and existence while also accepting God as the creator.\u201d Here, the two philosophers encounter each other in a forest landscape and engage in a brief, esoteric debate that cannot be resolved; they are accompanied all the while by an original soundtrack made up of an intricate assembly of short recordings of single notes. The work\u2019s title refers to a huge dog that brings the men\u2019s deliberations to an untimely end. The animal\u2019s name and form recall the subject of Eadweard Muybridge\u2019s photographic motion study <em>Dog</em>; <em>Trotting</em>; <em>Mastiff-Dread</em> (1884/87), alluding both to the culture of nineteenth-century scientific investigation and to Muybridge\u2019s experiments as precursors to the motion picture.</p>\n",
