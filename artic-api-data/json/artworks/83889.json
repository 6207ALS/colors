    "description": "<p>A pioneer of Abstract Expressionism, Willem de Kooning experimented with the human form throughout his career, which reached its apex in the early 1950s with his celebrated <em>Woman</em> series. <em>Two Women\u2019s Torsos</em> was created during an intense campaign in which the artist focused on drawings related to his <em>Woman</em> paintings, which were exhibited together with this and other drawings at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, in 1953.</p>\n<p>De Kooning\u2019s drawings are admired for their number and variety as well as for the artist\u2019s expressive technique, exemplified here by his gestural use of pastel in concert with charcoal. This drawing\u2019s velvety texture and almost violently animated surface are characteristic of the approximately one hundred sheets that remain from his intense work on the woman theme in 1952 and 1953. Also typical of de Kooning\u2019s art is the way in which <em>Two Women\u2019s Torsos</em> references aspects of related paintings but stands alone as an independent work. As the artist tried to jettison traditional modes of composition, he used drawing as a primary vehicle for the sequential development of his most important early body of work.</p>\n",
