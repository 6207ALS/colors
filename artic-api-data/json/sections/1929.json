Just one year before, she sat for the artist\u2019s striking portrait Woman with a Hat (1905; fig. 7\u20138.2), which he exhibited at the 1905 Salon d\u2019Automne, where French critics christened Matisse and his circle \u201cfauves,\u201d or wild beasts, for their explorations of the evocative potential of color. Part of his continued investigations of expressive forms outside of naturalism, these drawings demonstrate his emerging concern with decoration and sumptuous patterns.\n\nMadame Matisse with Her Fan relates to Matisse\u2019s earlier paintings of his wife wearing the same Japanese gown, including The Terrace, Saint Tropez (1904; fig. 7\u20138.3), Madame Matisse in a Kimono (1905; fig. 7\u20138.4), and La japonaise: Woman beside the Water (summer 1905; fig. 7\u20138.5). In each work, the artist used flat, gestural lines and saturated colors to depict the patterned garment, which both gives a shape to the covered body and pushes the decorative motif to the surface. The artist\u2019s friend and fellow Fauve Andr\u00e9 Derain depicted Matisse sketching Am\u00e9lie in the kimono in Matisse and His Wife at Collioure (summer 1905; fig. 7\u20138.6) and also made his own painting of Matisse\u2019s robed wife, Woman with a Shawl (1905; fig. 7\u20138.7). These works point to the importance of this decorative textile in Matisse\u2019s investigations of expressive plastic and pictorial forms.\n\nBoth Madame Matisse with Her Fan and Nude in a Folding Chair bear the hallmarks of Matisse\u2019s draftsmanship at this time. In the first, the off-center framing of Am\u00e9lie, seated and wearing the same kimono, accentuates the angled depiction of the figure. Her disproportionately large left side and simplified oversized hand seem to project forward from the paper. Using multiple sizes of dip pens, the artist created tension between volume and surface by utilizing flat, heavy strokes for the patterned textile and the shadow beneath the chair. Finer lines and a pointed pen further exaggerate the depth and volume of the seated figure. For Nude in a Folding Chair, the artist first drew a faint outline to indicate the general character of the pose. He completed the portrait with quick, short strokes of black wash, pairing overlapping, bold, expressive hatchmarks with the blank paper to evoke the figure and the space of the room. Partway through the process, Matisse added a paper strip to the top of the drawing that accentuates the skewed perspective that seems to simultaneously offer both a frontal and overhead view of the figure.\n\nThe artist\u2019s fascination with arresting, and often exotic, fabrics continued throughout his career (see cat. 34). While the recognizable kimono consumes the figure in Madame Matisse with Her Fan, Matisse used the common practice of laying a cloth beneath his seated model in Nude in a Folding Chair to explore the flattening effect of the design as it pushes against and surrounds the contours of her body. The stark contrast of negatives and positives defined within strong outlines in these drawings relates to Matisse\u2019s contemporaneous woodcuts. The artist only explored the medium during this period in a brief investigation that may have been hastened by his interest in the possibilities of line and decoration.  \nBrandon Ruud and Marin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\n\nFeb. 1963: Seated Woman in Armchair (Paul Rosenberg &amp; Co., 19th and 20th Century French Drawings and Watercolors, exh. cat.
