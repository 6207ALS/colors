    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The artist Pierre-Auguste Renoir once wrote, \u201cIn antiquity and among simple peoples the woman sings and dances. Gracefulness is her domain and even her duty.\u201d In this painting Renoir perfectly encapsulates this ideal, depicting music making as a graceful extension of female beauty. His subject is a pretty young woman dressed in a fashionably flowing indoor dress who plays the piano with a sense of poise and ease. We can imagine her fingers ranging softly over the keys bringing forth a melody as gentle and elegant as she herself. The woman does not exert herself with her playing, rather, she seems absorbed in the music, which gives the painting a meditative almost dreamlike quality. This is reflected by the way Renoir portrays the setting, with layers of intermingled curving brushstrokes that ensure nothing has a hard or definite edge. A soft, diffused light comes from an unseen window, illuminating the warm tones of her hands. Like the piano keys beneath them, almost everything in the room is touched with different shades of blue, which enhances the paintings calm, reflective atmosphere.</p>\n",
