Bayard is taken to the home of a local noblewoman to recuperate, and she offers him a fortune in ransom money for her family\u2019s protection that he gallantly refuses.<br>In his drawing, Girodet mingles the emerging French vogue for the Middle Ages with the reigning taste for the antique. Bayard looks like an ancient Roman hero, while at the same time, the dress and trappings of the scene are medieval in a highly romanticized way.</p>\n",
