Saint Joseph was especially popular in 17th-century Counter-Reformation Spain, as he was reputed to have helped heal Saint Teresa of \u00c1vila\u2019s paralysis. This tender picture is one of only about 70 known autograph drawings by Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, founder of a drawing academy in Seville and one of the most esteemed artists of the Spanish Baroque.</p>\n",
