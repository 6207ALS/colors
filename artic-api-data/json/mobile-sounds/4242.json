    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Welcome to Life, Death and Salvation: Stories of the Renaissance.  This tour is made up of eight stops that span four rooms in the Deering Galleries.  On this audio tour, curators Rebecca Long and Martha Wolfe will give you an insider's look at the Art Institute's collection of medieval and renaissance art.  You'll hear about how reliquaries are like side show attractions, real jewels with healing powers, St. George the Dragon Slayer, and much, much more.  The stories are unexpected, intriguing, and sometimes even a little funny.  We hope you enjoy the tour and thank you for listening.  This audio guide is supported by Bloomberg Philanthropies.</p>\n",
