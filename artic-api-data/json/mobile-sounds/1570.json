    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: This is an extraordinary piece. It\u2019s very unusual. It\u2019s a hybrid. It\u2019s at the same time a cabinet, a piece of furniture; it\u2019s also a wood carving and it\u2019s also a painting since the carving is painted.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Curator Gloria Groom. The cabinet was made in 1888 as a collaboration between two artists, Paul Gauguin and his friend Emile Bernard.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: They took on the subjects of the people, animals, and the place where they were together that summer in Pont-Aven on the Brittany coast in France. And, so, you see these women with these odd headdresses. You see oxen, you see geese. These are the sort of folklore of the town they were in.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Gauguin carved the central panel, which depicts the Biblical story of Jacob wrestling with an angel. The right-hand panel, also by Gaugin, includes a woman with a turban and a man in a striped shirt and straw hat.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And these are memory people. These are figures that he drew from his last voyage to Martinique, an Island that was owned by France. And, so, it\u2019s a wonderful blend of Gauguin\u2019s present life of a recent trip he took, but it\u2019s also a glimpse into Gauguin\u2019s future for, indeed, three years after making this cabinet he would embark on another voyage this time much further away to Tahiti.</p>\n",
