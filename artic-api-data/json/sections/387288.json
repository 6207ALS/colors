He became editor of The Scots Observer in 1888 and retained the editorship after the paper moved from Edinburgh to London to become The National Observer. Charles Whibley, who became Whistler\u2019s brother-in-law when he married Ethel Birnie Philip in 1894, was a frequent contributor to The National Observer. Whibley\u2019s association with Henley brought Whistler into frequent contact with the editor and his literary circle. Boisterous and burly, Henley loved to argue and was known for his ability to recognize new literary talent. Oscar Wilde wrote of him: \u201cHis personality is insistent. To converse with him is a physical no less than intellectual recreation. He is never forgotten by his enemies, and often forgiven by his friends.\u201d Although both Whistler and Henley were distinguished by unusually volatile temperaments, their relationship endured over many years. Interestingly, Whistler\u2019s close friend, the publisher William Heinemann, proposed that Henley write the artist\u2019s biography. Although Whistler rejected the choice (the task fell instead to the Pennells), the friendship survived. Henley\u2019s demise saddened Whistler who, ill as he was, sent \u201ca great spray of purple iris\u201d to Henley\u2019s funeral a few days before his own death.\n\nThe sitting must have occurred during the last days of March, for the drawing was transferred to stone and proved by the Ways on 1 April 1896 (app. II.4). Henley posed leaning on the arm of a chair, a cigarette in his right hand. The image is one of only a handful of portrait lithographs in which Whistler opted for the half-length format. Only in his two drawings of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 59 and cat. 60), the portrait of Elizabeth Pennell (cat. 145), and the posthumously printed oval study of Rosalind Birnie Philip (cat. 165) did he adopt similar poses.\n\nThe portrait of Henley was reworked extensively on the stone after its transfer. Whistler made delicate additions in the face, hair, both arms, torso, and background with crayons and touches of the stump. According to T. R. Way (1912), the artist \u201cafterwards regretted\u201d the additional work on the stone. No proofs have been located to indicate the appearance of the initial drawing prior to the alterations. Only a small number of proofs were pulled of the finished portrait, and no impressions remained in the artist\u2019s estate at the time of his death.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (302 \u00d7 183 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (302 \u00d7 183 mm), signed.

There are a number of interesting references to Henley and his relationship with Whistler in Stanley Weintraub, Whistler: A Biography (New York, 1974), pp. 144, 351, 365\u221266, 463.\n\nOscar Wilde\u2019s comments were written in 1897 to accompany the publication of William Rothenstein\u2019s portrait of Henley.\n\nPennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, p. 247; Pennell and Pennell (1921), p. 292.\n\nThere is a discrepancy in numbers, according to the checklist published in MacDonald (1988), pp. 48\u201349. Goulding printed a posthumous edition of 37 impressions of this lithograph in 1903. There were 47 impressions in Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s estate in 1958. Either there was a mistake in the inventory of Birnie Philip\u2019s holdings, or Goulding actually printed a larger edition than was recorded in the ledger, GUL LB6.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 163, only state.
