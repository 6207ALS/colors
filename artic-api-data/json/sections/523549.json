    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">Focused on Ensor\u2019s paintings from before and after he made The Temptation, this gallery shows how the artist\u2019s imagery changed course dramatically between the 1880s and the 1890s. Although the works reveal a constant interest in light, color, and technical experimentation, their subject matter varies wildly. It is hard to believe that the artist of the early and conventional Rooftops of Ostend also produced the broken sky of the Adam and Eve Expelled from Paradise. Most unsettling of all, perhaps, are the grotesque carnival scenes Ensor made toward the end of this period. Masked faces leer in lurid colors and skeletons brandish weapons in works that tread a fine line between humor and terror.\n\nIt is clear that, between 1885 and 1890, Ensor\u2019s art underwent a deep transformation. During these turbulent years, against a backdrop of social and political changes in Belgium, the artist suffered considerable personal difficulties. The works here provide a visual summary of the extraordinary artistic evolution that took place over this painful period.\n\nGrey Seascape  \n1880  \nOil on canvas  \n59 \u00d7 74 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1851\n\nThe White Cloud  \n1884  \nOil on canvas  \n80 \u00d7 99 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2175\n\nRooftops of Ostend  \n1884  \nOil on canvas  \n157 \u00d7 209 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2706\n\nChildren at Their Morning Toilet  \n1886  \nOil on canvas  \n136 \u00d7 110 cm  \nMuseum of Fine Arts Ghent (Belgium), on long-term loan from the Flemish Community, 2008-B\n\nAdam and Eve Expelled from Paradise  \n1887  \nOil on canvas  \n205 \u00d7 245 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2072\n\nThe Fall of the Rebel Angels  \n1889  \nOil on canvas  \n108 \u00d7 132 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2176\n\nThe Astonishment of the Mask Wouse  \n1889  \nOil on canvas  \n109 \u00d7 131 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2042\n\nTheatre of Masks  \n1889  \nOil on canvas  \n59 \u00d7 72 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1855\n\nThe Intrigue  \n1890  \nOil on canvas  \n89.5 \u00d7 149 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1856\n\nThe Man of Sorrows  \n1891  \nOil on panel  \n20 \u00d7 15.5 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 3320\n\nSkeletons Fighting Over a Hanged Man  \n1891  \nOil on canvas  \n59 \u00d7 74 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1857\n\nMask and Crustaceans  \n1891  \nOil on panel  \n31 \u00d7 39 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1958\n\nSkeleton Painting  \nc. 1896  \nOil on panel  \n37.5 \u00d7 45.3 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 3112\n\nFlowers and Vegetables  \n1896  \nOil on canvas  \n79 \u00d7 98 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1858\n\nEnsor was born and raised in the Belgian port of Ostend; its constantly changing skies, by turns melancholy and luminous, were a frequent theme in his art. Despite his fondness for the town, however, he remained something of an outsider. While his Flemish mother helped to run a family souvenir shop, his father was an unpopular Englishman, unemployed and alcoholic.\n\nThe economy and the mood of Ostend fluctuated with the seasons. A tourist population coexisted with the locals, and extremes of wealth and poverty were painfully obvious. Social tensions were even more pronounced in Brussels, the bilingual (French- and Dutch-speaking) Belgian capital, where Ensor went to study. Clashes between its working-class population and the authorities were frequent. The artist was quick to capture the unrest in both Ostend and Brussels, satirizing the king, the government, and other authorities in his art.\n\nIn The Temptation, beneath an impossibly blue sky, crowds gather and protestors march; but in the works here the extremes of Ensor\u2019s love of and disdain for his homeland are even more apparent.\n\n\u00c9douard Dubar (Belgian, 1803\u20131879)  \nSeascape  \nn.d.  \nOil on canvas  \n18 \u00d7 32 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\n\u00c9douard Dubar (Belgian, 1803\u20131879)  \nPublished by Daniels-Dubar (Belgian, 1843\u20131870)  \n\u201cDo you want me to carry you? . . . ,\u201d, no. 60 from Souvenir des Bains d\u2019Ostende  \nc. 1860  \nColor lithograph on paper  \n36 \u00d7 28 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\n\u00c9douard Dubar (Belgian, 1803\u20131879)  \nPublished by Daniels-Dubar (Belgian, 1843\u20131870)  \nArtillery Guard, from Types de l\u2019arm\u00e9e belge en 1865  \n1865  \nColor lithograph on paper  \n35 \u00d7 25.5 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nBoat at Sea with Houses in the Background  \n1873/75  \nOil on red card  \n10.2 \u00d7 13 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nFishermen with Horse and Small Boat Aground  \n1873/75  \nOil on red card  \n10.2 \u00d7 13 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nBeached Sailboat with Figures  \n1873/75  \nOil on red card  \n10.2 \u00d7 13 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nCart with Horse and Figur  \n1873/75  \nOil on red card  \n10.2 \u00d7 13 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nThe Bathing Hut  \nc. 1876  \nOils on cardboard  \n17.5 \u00d7 22.5 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2972\n\nThe Breakwater  \n1878  \nOil on canvas  \n36.3 \u00d7 46.6 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 3380\n\nYoung Boy  \nc. 1880  \nCharcoal on paper  \n77 \u00d7 60 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nWoman on a Breakwater  \n1880  \nOil on canvas  \n32 \u00d7 24 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 3384\n\nSilhouettes  \n1882/83  \nWatercolor on paper  \n11.5 \u00d7 18.5 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nThe Rower  \n1883  \nOil on canvas  \n79 \u00d7 99 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2174\n\nThe Entry of Christ into Jerusalem  \nc. 1885  \nGraphite and Cont\u00e9 crayon on wove paper  \n22.1 \u00d7 17.3 cm  \nThe J.

In later years he criticized the experience, but it proved to have a profound impact on his creative development. Importantly, his attendance at the academy allowed him to meet other artists, including those he would join in creating the exhibition society Les XX (Les Vingt; The Twenty), a new forum for the display of avant-garde art. It also exposed him to the Old Masters; indeed, historic works of art would provide a constant source of inspiration throughout his career.\n\nAlthough his copies after Francisco de Goya, Frans Hals, and \u00c9douard Manet appear in this gallery, Ensor did not look to European art alone. He also admired popular Japanese prints, which his family sold to tourists in their souvenir shop. Japanese art featured in several exhibi\u00adtions in Brussels in the 1880s where\u2014like the work of Ensor and his contemporaries\u2014it sometimes baffled the press. One journalist, attacking The Temptation in 1889, observed, that \u201cJames Ensor has thrown himself completely into intransigent Japonisme.\u201d To this critic, the work of the audacious young artist was as incomprehensible as art from a distant land.\n\nThe Painter Alfred William Finch  \n1880 or 1882  \nOil on canvas  \n49.5 \u00d7 29.5 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2694\n\nTheo Hannon  \n1881 or 1882  \nOil on canvas  \n69 \u00d7 49 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1854\n\nSelf-Portrait at the Easel  \nc. 1890  \nOil on canvas  \n59.5 \u00d7 41 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2809\n\nStill Life with Oysters  \n1882  \nOil on canvas  \n79 \u00d7 99 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1412\n\nThe Skate  \nc. 1880  \nOil on canvas  \n80 \u00d7 90 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2188\n\nSketchbook  \nn.d.  \nCont\u00e9 crayon and pencil  \n18.1 \u00d7 45.2 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2709\n\nAfter \u00c9douard Manet (French, 1832\u20131883)  \nM\u00e9ry Laurent with Pug  \nc. 1884  \nCont\u00e9 crayon on paper  \n22.5 \u00d7 17 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2711/36\n\nAfter Honor\u00e9 Daumier (French, 1808\u20131879)  \nThe Happy Hunters  \nc. 1880\u201386  \nRed chalk on paper  \n17 \u00d7 22.5 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2711/42\n\nFrancisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes (Spanish, 1746\u20131828)  \nThey Spruce Themselves Up, plate 51 from Los Caprichos  \n1797/99  \nEtching and aquatint in sepia on ivory laid paper  \n18.1 \u00d7 12.7 cm (image); 21 \u00d7 14.8 cm (plate); 30.1 \u00d7 20.7 cm (sheet)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Clarence Buckingham Collection, 1948.110.51\n\nAfter Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes (Spanish, 1746\u20131828)  \nThey Spruce Themselves Up, plate 51 from Los Caprichos  \nc. 1885  \nBlack Cont\u00e9 crayon on ivory wove paper (discolored to cream)  \n15.7 \u00d7 22.6 cm  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mr. and Mrs. James W.

Rather than depict dramatic social or political events, he elevated the domestic interior, celebrating the kind of environment in which a letter or a piece of music could have a profound effect. His family served as models for many of these tightly composed, slightly claustro\u00adphobic scenes.\n\nPainting such interiors was not an easy route to success. Though these images may seem conventional now, they inspired great controversy at the time. Reviewers found particular fault with Ensor\u2019s Oyster Eater, arguing that its monumental size was at odds with its banal subject matter and that the artist had left it unfinished in spots.\n\nWith hindsight, however, it seems that the negative reactions simply encouraged the artist. They led him to distrust the critics, to believe in his own talent, and to develop independent ambitions. These lessons would prove vital to Ensor. Without them, he could not have created his monumental Temptation.\n\nGirl with Upturned Nose  \n1879  \nOil on canvas  \n54 \u00d7 45 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2077\n\nWaiting  \n1879/82  \nOil on canvas  \n65 \u00d7 52 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2074\n\nThe Lady with the Red Parasol  \n1880  \nOil on canvas  \n51 \u00d7 37 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2197\n\nThe Lady with Fan  \n1880/81  \nOil on canvas mounted on panel  \n132.5 \u00d7 83 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2833\n\nWoman with Blue Shawl  \n1881  \nOil on canvas  \n74 \u00d7 59 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1853\n\nThe Bourgeois Salon  \n1881  \nOil on canvas  \n133 \u00d7 109 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2735\n\nAfternoon in Ostend  \n1881  \nOil on canvas  \n108 \u00d7 133 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 1852\n\nThe Oyster-Eater  \n1882  \nOil on canvas  \n207 \u00d7 105 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 2073\n\nBringing the lessons of his early work to bear on his exploration of new concerns, Ensor created The Temptation of Saint Anthony in 1887 and 1888. Exorcising both public and private anxieties, the artist developed a complex composition made up of fifty-one sketchbook sheets and folios (two-page sheets), where reality and fantasy clash and compete for attention.\n\nIn the center of the image is the kneeling figure of Saint Anthony, a fourth-century hermit who famously resisted the allure of sinful visions through prayer and fasting. Above his head, crowned in a military helmet, a sorrowful Christ appears in the clouds. To the left and right of the saint are crowds of contemporary and historical figures. These groupings are sometimes comic, sometimes frightening; a band of motley musicians bombards the saint with song while blood from a nearby slaughter spills freely. As Ensor worked, he delighted in the unfolding chaos. \u201cI\u2019ve added a few hundred more figures: ghastly dev\u00adils, horrible animals, revolting and obscene monsters,\u201d he explained in a letter to his friend Mariette Rousseau. \u201cI am very pleased.\u201d\n\nIn making The Temptation, the artist combined popular and sophisti\u00adcated references, creating a work that challenges cultural hierarchies. The use of newly invented colored pencils on a scale usually reserved for grandiose paintings reinforces the subversive spirit of the drawing. Like a wandering dream, which sometimes strays into nightmarish territory, The Temptation soothes and startles in turn.\n\nAlbert Bouts (Netherlandish, c. 1452\u20131549)  \nMan of Sorrows  \n1490/1500  \nOil on panel  \n29 \u00d7 29 cm  \nRoyal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp, 250\n\nThe Temptation of Saint Anthony  \n1887  \nColored pencils and scraping, with graphite, charcoal, Cont\u00e9 crayon, and additions in colored chalk and watercolor, selectively fixed, with cut and pasted elements, on 51 sheets of ivory wove paper (discolored to cream), joined, and formerly laid down on canvas  \n179.5 \u00d7 154.7 cm  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Regenstein Endowment and the Louise B. and Frank H.

Wrenn Memorial Endowment Fund, 2011.423\n\nIn 1885 Ensor began work on a series of important drawings that anticipated The Temptation in scale and subject matter. He called them The Visions: The Aureoles of Christ or the Sensibilities of Light. The display in this gallery unites them for the first time in North America, respecting the narrative sequence Ensor set out in the exhibition catalogue for Les XX in 1887, where they were first shown.\n\nNot only an exploration of the different atmospheric qualities of light, but also an analogy of the artist\u2019s creative suffering, The Visions relays biblical events in intensely personal ways. Borrowing heavily from Rembrandt, Ensor depicted Christ as a mortal: a lonely individual, adored and then ostracized, left to the mercy of the crowd. The artist identified strongly with his misunderstood protagonist; he felt isolated frequently, and he often argued with his art world peers.\n\nThe formal qualities of Ensor\u2019s drawings further emphasize their ephemeral character. By using mostly large sheets of paper instead of sturdier canvas supports, Ensor made works that seem transient and vulnerable. While The Visions\u2014made with chalk, pencil, or charcoal\u2014convey light, their delicate tonality changes with shifting viewing con\u00additions. Here, in this darkened room, they invite quiet contemplation.\n\nNaked: Christ Shown to the People  \n1885  \nBlack crayon and watercolor on paper, mounted on canvas  \n155 \u00d7 102 cm  \nMuseum of Fine Arts Ghent (Belgium), on long-term loan from the Flemish Community, 1988-C\n\nBright and Radiant: The Entry into Jerusalem  \n1885  \nBlack and brown crayon, with collaged element, mounted on canvas  \n206 \u00d7 150.3 cm  \nMuseum of Fine Arts Ghent (Belgium), 1963-E\n\nIntense: Christ Ascending to Heaven  \n1885  \nBlack chalk, pencil, and charcoal on paper, mounted on Japanese paper  \n150 \u00d7 100 cm  \nPrivate collection\n\nQuiet and Serene: The Descent from the Cross  \n1886  \nOil and colored chalk on prepared panel  \n58 \u00d7 46 cm  \nPrivate collection\n\nSad and Shattered: Satan and His Legions of Demons Torment the Crucified  \n1886  \nCharcoal, black chalk, and pencil on paper, laid down on Japan paper  \n61.3 \u00d7 75.8 cm  \nRoyal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, 4193\n\nJoyful: The Adoration by the Shepherds  \nc. 1886  \nCharcoal, black chalk, and pencil on paper, laid down on Japan paper  \n76.8 \u00d7 61.1 cm  \nRoyal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, 4192\n\nTo late-ninteenth-century Europeans, the story of Saint Anthony was a familiar one, played out in popular and intellectual arenas alike. Though the tale was ostensibly one of a fourth-century hermit saint who resisted corrupting visions through prayer, it had long served artists as a means to depict controversial or fantastic imagery. Accordingly, in the examples seen here, invented demonic beasts keep company with lifelike naked bodies. The viewer, like the saint, is in turn shocked and seduced.\n\nEnsor may not have been familiar with all of the variations of the story seen in this room, but given his enduring fascination with the subject, they place his version in context. It is clear that some provided literal sources of inspiration; one of Ensor\u2019s letters refers to the \u201cstunning devilry\u201d he saw in The Temptation of Saint Anthony by printmaker Jacques Callot, for instance, while the dreamlike atmosphere of Gustave Flaubert\u2019s book of the same name seems also to have made an impression.\n\nIn addition to his interest in Saint Anthony, Ensor also identified with Jesus, often combining his own features with those of Christ or depicting himself in pseudo-biblical scenarios. As frequently, however, he included a touch of self-deprecating humor. The artist saw the absurdities in his own dilemmas as much as he satirized those of the contemporary world\n\nMartin Schongauer (German, c. 1450\u20131491)  \nThe Temptation of Saint Anthony  \n1470\u201375  \nEngraving in black on cream laid paper  \n32 \u00d7 23.5 cm  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mrs. Potter Palmer, Jr., 1955.1227\n\nJohann Theodor de Bry (German, 1561\u20131623)  \nafter Pieter Breugel the Elder (Flemish, 1525/30\u20131569)  \nPublished in the Emblemata Secularia by Johann Theodor de Bry, Frankfurt or Oppenheim  \nThe Temptation of Saint Anthony, plate 16 from the Emblemata Secularia  \nPublished 1596 or 1611  \nEngraving in black on ivory laid paper  \n8.1 \u00d7 10.5 cm (image/plate);

They provided him with financial, moral, and artistic support, and even served as his models.\n\nEnsor\u2019s aunt and mother ran a souvenir shop on a major street in Ostend. The family lived above the store, and Ensor kept a studio in its attic. He had a younger sister, Mitche, and his grandmother was also a frequent visitor to the house. But, as much as he depended on the women in his family, Ensor was fonder still of his father: an unem\u00adployed Englishman who spent periods of time in an asylum, struggling with alcoholism, before dying prematurely in 1887.\n\nProfound grief, compounded by the loss of his maternal grandmother earlier that year, was surely one of the factors at play as Ensor created The Temptation. His own poor health also had an impact. Fortunately, the artist found comfort in the Hannon-Rousseau family, with whom he had bonded while studying in Brussels. The painter Theo Hannon had been a fellow student; his sister, a mycologist (plant biologist) named Mariette, married Ernest Rousseau, a teacher of natural sciences at the university in Brussels. The couple had a young son, Ernest Rousseau junior, whom Ensor treated like a sibling. Shared interests, humor, and affection abound in the images the artist made for and of these close friends.\n\nLe Bon, Ostende  \nJames Ensor in 1883  \nPhotograph  \n17 \u00d7 10.5 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nDupont, Brussels  \nJames Ensor in 1887  \nPhotograph  \n16.5 \u00d7 11 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nDupont, Brussels  \nJames Ensor in 1887  \nPhotograph  \n16.5 \u00d7 11 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nLe Bon, Ostende  \nEnsor\u2019s Father on Deathbed  \n1887  \nPhotograph  \n10 \u00d7 16 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nLetter to Octave Maus  \nAugust 1884  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nLetter to Theo Hannon  \n22 \u00d7 17 cm  \nCollection of Patrick Florizoone\n\nSelf-Portrait  \n1878  \nCharcoal with graphite and touches of black Cont\u00e9 crayon on ivory wove paper  \n21.7 \u00d7 16.9 cm  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mr. and Mrs. James W.
