    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Painted in the Netherlands in 1658, this masterly still life held a fascinating secret for many years. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: This painting is signed by Adriaen van der Spelt, a still life painter whose work is rather rare. But fairly recently, we realized that it's in fact a collaboration between van der Spelt and a more famous painter named Frans van Mieris who contributed the beautiful blue satin curtain that is drawn across part of the picture.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The young artists had both just joined the Painters Gild in the City of Leiden, so this picture was probably a demonstration in their skill in the art of illusion.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: And also a reflection of actual usage at the time, because Dutch collectors would use curtains to protect particularly exquisite pictures from light and also to give the viewer the thrill of pulling back the curtain and seeing what was displayed behind it. And you have multiple layers of illusion here because you have first the stone arch and then you have the garland that's draped in front of it, and then you have the curtain. And one of the most wonderful things is really the brass rod which plays off of the frame of the picture. It stands in front of it.</p>\n",
