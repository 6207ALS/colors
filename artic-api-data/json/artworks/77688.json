    "description": "<p>Early American weather vanes, such as this silhouetted peacock, were collected in the 20th century for their sculptural qualities and celebrated as precursors to modernism. The Art Institute acquired this hand-forged vane from gallerist Edith Halpert, who distinguished herself in the New York art world by focusing on modern American art and vernacular arts from centuries prior. She operated two galleries in the same building: the Downtown Gallery, which focused on modern American art like the painting <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50947/my-man\"><em>My Man</em></a> (1944.426) by Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and the American Folk Art Gallery. Weather vanes were popular among Halpert\u2019s clients; as <em>Time</em> magazine reported, she \u201cbusily stripped the New England skyline of more than 100 vanes\u201d for sale to collectors and museums.</p>\n",
