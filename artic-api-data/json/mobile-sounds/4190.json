    "transcript": "<p>Woman 1: Young Chicago Authors, YCA, is an organization that cultivates young voices through writing, publishing and performance education. The poem you're about to hear was written by a YCA poet as a response to a work of art in our collection.</p>\n<p>Luis Alfonso: My name is Luis , Luis Alfonso. I am a emerging teaching artist at YCA and this piece is inspired by the Takashi Murakami, &quot;Mr. Pointy.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;This is the part where different worlds collide, where you gaze with uncertainty to the different colors of life. Here we all come from different backgrounds but face the same faceless future. Today you say your last goodbyes, walk in between the floating leafs, step on as many sets of hideous eyes looking at you naked and vulnerable. This is the part where you are still trying to find yourself or at least the part left of you, in a dream catcher that serves as a reminder of what you work so hard for. Always pointing towards a way back home, the bright colors are your obsession to prove destiny wrong. The darkness is your lack of forgiveness. The darkness holds your secrets and you become invincible. The body and mind become an oval portal pure and careless in its whites and you pass but this time with no borders, no walls, invisible lines or identifications. This time the hands won't push you back. You are the universe and all of its elements. You are headed to the highest peak.&quot;</p>\n",
