The title of this portrait refers to the voluminous, high-collared Russian coat worn by Pennell. According to the account given by the Pennells in their 1908 biography of the artist, Whistler had planned to paint a full-length oil version of the subject, but abandoned the project when Pennell was obliged to leave London for a time and Beatrix Whistler\u2019s health began to deteriorate. The artist may have regarded this image drawn on transfer paper as a preliminary study for that painting.\n\nAccording to the Pennells, Whistler drew their portraits during afternoon visits to their flat on Ruckingham Street; some of these were made by firelight (cat. 143, cat 144, and cat. 145). After The Russian Schube was transferred to stone, Whistler made a number of revisions, both additive and subtractive, that emphasized the effect of bright sidelighting and deep cast shadows. He probably did this work at the Way offices on Wellington Street, where he spent considerable time in the early weeks of 1896 reworking earlier drawings that had been put on stone by his printers.\n\nNo doubt due to her hostility toward the Pennells, Rosalind Birnie Philip had Goulding destroy this stone in 1903, without printing a posthumous edition.\n\nIn the image as originally drawn and transferred to stone, a stray line above the right side of the collar has not yet been removed.\n\nGlasgow: HAG, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 227 mm).

Another tier has been added to the bottom of the bookcase, thus establishing the floor line. The outlines of the coat, sleeve, and upturned collar have been clarified by scraping. Diagonal hatching has been added along the lower left edge of the coat. A few vertical lines have been added to the third tier of the bookcase. Cross-hatching has been added between the figure\u2019s legs. The stray line above the right side of the upturned collar has been removed. Diagonal shading has been added to the right side of the coat and to the shadows at far right, extending and altering the shape of the shadow. Additions have been made to the right side of the cap, the upturned collar, and the butterfly monogram.\n\nChicago:AIC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, tan laid Japanese vellum (232 \u00d7 198 mm), signed.
