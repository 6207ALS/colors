    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Drinking cups such as this one called a kylix were used to serve wine during the Greek social gathering known as the symposium. Much like attending a symposium today participants exchanged news, discussed philosophy and debated issues and followed it all with a drink. Terah Walkup of the Art Institute\u2019s department of ancient and Byzantine Art.</p>\n<p>TERAH WALKUP: The symposium was a time for Greek men to get together to finely tune the art of conversation, to recite poetry, enjoy music, and dance performances as well as enjoy food and wine.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: To underscore the gathering\u2019s masculine theme an artist decorated this cup with the image of an athlete wearing the leather hand straps of a boxer perhaps honoring a recent victor. As for those large painted eyes and expressive eyebrows they definitely helped lighten the mood.</p>\n<p>TERAH WALKUP: The handles act as ears. And the stem of the vessel when upturned looks as if it\u2019s an open mouth. When the drinker would have lifted this cup and brought the vessel to his face it would have appeared as if this drinker was wearing a mask.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Dionysus, god of wine, was also the god of Greek theater where all actors wore expressive masks. So drinking from a cup resembling a mask had an entertaining appeal especially since it doubled as an ancient party trick which surely grew more amusing as the wine continued to flow.</p>\n",
