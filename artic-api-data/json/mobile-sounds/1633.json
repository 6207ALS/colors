    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Spanish artist Francisco Goya made this painting around 1787.  Martha Wolff:</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: This charming image of a small boy dressed up and riding on a ram is part of a suite of designs that Goya made for a series of tapestries that were to decorate the dining room of the heir to the throne of Spain.  The whole room was to be lined by tapestries, and the largest ones were to show the four seasons, and then over the doors and smaller spaces in the room, he designed these playful and decorative subjects, including the boy on a ram; and this painting was actually the full-scale cartoon to be used by the weavers in the making of the tapestry.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Goya playfully lowers the horizon line in the painting so that the little boy seems to dominate the landscape.  Its lush blues and greens contrast decoratively with his black and red silk outfit, while the sunlight is inventively reflected up onto his face from his white frilled collar.  The idea of a boy riding a ram fits perfectly with the fanciful themes of the other tapestry designs.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF:  Some of the other over-doors include whimsical things like a fight between two cats.  So I think it's for the amusement and delight of the people who were conversing in the dining room.&quot;</p>\n",
