Wall revetment fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished on the face. The fragment preserves the left and right sides of an inlay; two adjacent sides are broken. In a brown matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from segments of two canes: one of small rods of greenish yellow that vary in section from ovoid to square to triangular; the second a stylized rosette of robin\u2019s-egg blue with a center surrounded by seven petals, all outlined in white.\n\nThe face has been repolished; the edges and back are heavily pitted with a dully iridescent weathering crust.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 98 Fragment of a Wall Revetment, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
