    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: What you\u2019re seeing here is an instructive accident. It\u2019s a sturdy thick walled stone ware ball fused with its saggar a firing container made form rougher clay.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARSTEIN:  Pieces were fired in individual saggars and then stacked in the firing chamber in order to maximize the space and insulate the vessels from flame and from ash. The people who made this type of ware favored this coarse, thick walled cylindrical saggar which encouraged the uniform flow of the gases around each vessel. In this case, the saggar simply collapsed and the pieces stuck inside. When you turn this piece upside down you\u2019ll see the base of the bowel broke the bottom part of the saggar.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The cloudy lavender blue color of the glaze is an optical allusion which the potter carefully brought about.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN:  What happens is that the potter is prolonging the cooling of the kiln at the end of the firing cycle. And inducing glaze to sort of bubble with these minute glassy crystals that reflect and scatter blue light.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: :  The bright purple splash on the other hand is a true color created by a sprinkling of copper oxide onto the glaze. Bowls like this are known as Jian ware after the kiln site in northern China where they were first discovered.</p>\n",
