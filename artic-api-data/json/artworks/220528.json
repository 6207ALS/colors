This composition of ephemera and drawn interludes resembles a scrapbook page of mementos, except that each column of images seems like an independent sequence that should add up but doesn\u2019t. The collage elements become word surrogates, components of visual sentences that \u201cread\u201d from top to bottom yet fail to form a cohesive story\u2014just as the handwritten \u201ccaptions\u201d only appear to have meaning but are in fact only shapes that resemble letters.</p>\n",
