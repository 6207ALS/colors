    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The song you\u2019re hearing is now is called Adeus Maria Fulo, by the musician, Joyce. James Rondeau on the importance of music to Oiticica:</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Helio\u2019s relationship to music is a big story. Growing up in Rio de Janiero in the 1950s, of course Helio is very connected to Bossa Nova music, he\u2019s very connected to Samba. The idea that he was a creative person surrounded by music as a creative art form is something that is established in his mindset and his worldview early on. He understands the kind of rebel attraction of Jimi Hendrix and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards and so Helio\u2019s relationship to music is framed by a larger cultural perspective about freedom, resistance, the ability to break with existing cultural convention.</p>\n",
