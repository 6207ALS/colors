    "description": "<p>Lyonel Feininger\u2014a cartoonist-turned-Expressionist painter\u2014was the first instructor Walter Gropius hired to teach at the famed Bauhaus, a German art and design school that operated from 1919 to 1933. Buildings served as an apt visual metaphor for both the Bauhaus\u2019s aesthetic and its goals of dissolving boundaries and uniting \u201ceverything in one structure.\u201d Feininger was recognized as the leading exponent of this ideal, and he turned his attention to the architectural landscape during his time at the school. In <em>Village Street</em>, overlapping planes of transparent, crystalline shapes form a simultaneously hard-edged and ethereal vision of modern urban life.</p>\n",
