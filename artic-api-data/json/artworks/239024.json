    "description": "<p>Yuri Suzuki is a sound artist, designer, and electronic musician whose work raises questions about the relationship between sound and the human mind. Ototo is a kit for making electronic music, with a custom-made synthesizer that triggers different sounds when connected to conductive materials using alligator clips. As the video shows, anything from a banana to a houseplant can be attached to the keyboard to produce a musical note. Reinterpreting the process of composing, reading, and playing into something that everyone can do engages all users in making electronic music.</p>\n",
