Zeisler is known for her monumental, free compositions of knotted and wrapped fiber. This suede rectangle was part of a series of works that incorporated mundane found materials such as stones, coins, printed textiles, buttons, and bits of glass. This suede rectangle became the ground for a collage of natural and manmade objects, attached with colored thread, along with geometric shapes in cut suede, much like the exercises undertaken as texture studies at the ID.</p>\n",
