    "description": "<p>In Central Asia, the ancient art form of embroidery dates back to at least the third century BC. In the eighteenth and nineteenth century, this tradition manifested in the <em>suzani</em>. <em>Suzani</em>s were large patterned embroidered textiles used for various furnishing functions in the urban homes of towns and cities in present-day Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. Utilizing cotton and silk and displaying floral imagery, many of these <em>suzani</em>s were made by girls and women for a bride's trousseau. </p><p>In this presentation Sumru Belger Krody, senior curator at the George Washington University Museum and the Textile Museum, discusses the role of embroidered textiles in the nineteenth-century urban life of Central Asia, the stylistic differences seen in examples from various oasis cities, and the history and development of <em>suzani </em>designs.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.</p>",
