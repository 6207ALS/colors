    "description": "<p>This site-specific installation by Los Angeles-based artist Martine Syms is the first sitcom episode from the artist\u2019s proposed series <em>SHE MAD</em>. <em>Laughing Gas</em> was a 1907 silent film by Edwin Porter, which follows Mandy, played by Bertha Regustus, as she moves through the world laughing uncontrollably after receiving nitrous oxide at the dentist\u2019s office. Syms reimagines Porter\u2019s film today with the artist performing the role of \u201cMartine\u201d in a sequence of improvised vignettes. Shot on multiple formats, and including security camera split screens, found clips, and internet GIFs, these scenes reflect Syms\u2019s multimedia practice and interests in cinema, American pop culture, black aesthetics, and semiotics. The text \u201cBelieve Me\u201d appears both in the video and painted on the gallery wall as an extended caption. The laser-cut panel features an image of Regustus, shadows cast by a cucoloris cut-out pattern\u2014a film and theater lighting device\u2014and an article of the artist\u2019s clothing.</p>\n",
