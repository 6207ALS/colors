    "description": "<p>Georges Seurat made this painting as a preparatory work for his monumental <em>Bathers at Asni\u00e8res</em>, now in the National Gallery, London. It shows men and boys on the bank of the Seine River in the working-class Parisian suburb of Asni\u00e8res. The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884\"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em></a>. The frozen gestures and sedate poses of these bathers set a mood distinct from the sparkling scenes of Parisians enjoying <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81555/lunch-at-the-restaurant-fournaise-the-rowers-lunch\">restaurants</a> and other <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/95654/near-the-lake\">riverbank activities</a> favored by the Impressionists. Nevertheless, Seurat\u2019s focus on a subject from modern life, his luminous palette, and his airy brushwork show how the young artist adapted characteristics of Impressionist painting for his own purposes.</p>\n",
