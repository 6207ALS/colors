In the expressive Nude in Profile, we can identify both his earliest lines, which are light and searching, and his heavier, final marks. This allows us to trace Matisse\u2019s path as he searched for the final form and, as it became clear in his mind, how he coaxed that form onto the page.\n\nIn this work, the figure stretches nearly the full length of the paper, its lean profile accentuated by the overlapping short strokes in the upper half of the body. Despite minimal shading and detail, these marks give the figure a solidity and weight that contrast with the expanse of bare paper to its right and left. To achieve this elegant image, Matisse accentuated and manipulated the profile, extending and varying the width of the model\u2019s legs and elongating the feet. Earlier marks reveal that the artist first drew a far thinner and more elastic front leg and later made the limb more angular. Other early marks that the artist left visible show that the figure\u2019s head was once higher and longer, the bent elbow wider and rounder, and the shoulders further hunched. In each case, Matisse revised the forms to be sharper and more compact. The exaggeration is even apparent in the model\u2019s closed right hand. Nearly as big as the head, it is positioned at an impossible angle, as if holding a posing pole, but nonetheless adds to the overall contrast of rounded and angular body parts.\n\nWhile Nude in Profile is likely after a studio model (Seated Nude [fig. 4.1] is a related drawing dated to 1903\u201304), the pose recalls those in a group of sculptures that Matisse initiated shortly after he made this work. Standing Nude, Arms on Head (1906, cast 1951; fig. 4.2) and a more abbreviated version called La vie (1906, cast c. 1908; fig. 4.3) also relate to figures in the artist\u2019s Arcadian paintings such as Le bonheur de vivre (1905\u201306; fig. 4.4). In this way, the overlapping short lines that form the drawn figure\u2019s torso might be read like analogues of the movements of Matisse\u2019s fingers as he imagined working and shaping the clay to this distinctive curving torso.\n\nNude in Profile was owned by the great Chicago collector and benefactor Emily Crane Chadbourne (see fig. 4.5). In 1926 she donated it, along with one hundred other works of art, to the Art Institute, making it among the first drawings by Matisse to be acquired by the museum.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this female nude using a graphite pencil on tan wove paper. He placed the figure using light, sketchy lines. When he arrived at the final position, he anchored the body with heavier, dark lines. These final marks are straight and meet at hard angles, producing an angular rhythm that runs throughout the composition. The artist added shading with rapid parallel hatching in the neck, under the arm, in the back, and in the lower pelvis. The remnants of erased dark lines just above the top of the head indicate that both elbows were initially raised (see fig. 4.6).\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 4.7); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The sheet was trimmed at the top edge, likely in preparation for mounting; an earlier position for the elbow is almost cut off. It is unclear whether the sheet was trimmed on all sides; it is also unclear whether it was Matisse or another who trimmed the sheet. The drawing was dry mounted to a cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, ivory color and makes another contrasting 4.8\u20135.4 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 40 \u00d7 29 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue can be seen under magnification 150\u00d7 at the bottom left corner of the drawing.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 4.8).\n\nGraphite with traces of erasing.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, tan wove paper. The sheet was trimmed at the top edge. The edges are straight cut. A significant proportion of fibers in the sheet have darkened over time, suggesting that the paper contains chemical wood pulp. The original paper color was lighter and can be seen along the bottom edge where the paper was once protected from light exposure. Occasional inclusions are evident throughout the sheet.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The edges are straight cut. There are two graphite marks at the top edge, which may have been used to guide its trimming. The texture on the recto has been compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 4.9), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light (fig. 4.10).\n\nPrimary support: 33 \u00d7 21.7 cm (13 \u00d7 8 1/2 in.); secondary support: 35.1 \u00d7 23.6 cm (13 3/4 \u00d7 9 1/4 in.); tertiary support: 44.4 \u00d7 34.2 cm (17 1/2 \u00d7 13 1/2 in.).\n\nThe mount received minor conservation treatment in 2013 to remove graphite notations made directly on the recto of the tertiary support. There is no evidence of earlier treatment.\n\nThere is extraneous charcoal along the top edge, on the right. It is unclear whether it was present when Matisse made the drawing. The primary support has darkened. The bottom edge retains a lighter paper color, which appears cooler and less yellowed. There are a few pinpoint accretions along the right margin of the tertiary support.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Emily Crane Chadbourne (Mar. 4, 1871\u2013Dec. 23, 1964), Stone Ridge, NY, by Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Dec. 21, 1926.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 21, 1926.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, as Drawing (no. 176).\n\nRenaissance Society of the University of Chicago, An Exhibition of Original Drawings by Masters of the Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth Centuries and Artists of the Present Day, Jan. 9\u201331, 1940, no cat.\n\nRenaissance Society of the University of Chicago, Drawings by Contemporary Artists, May 20\u2013June 10, 1944, cat. 31, as Nude Figure Standing.\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse Retrospective, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 144, as Standing Nude/Nu debout, 1906\u201307; Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966; and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Renaissance Society of the University of Chicago, Drawings by Contemporary Artists, exh. cat.

Barr dated this work to 1906, Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant at the Archives Henri Matisse, Paris, has recently redated it to 1903\u201304 as it relates to a series of drawings with the same dimensions and of the same model, one of which Matisse himself dated 1904.\n\nThis is one of nine Matisse drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection on similar mounts: Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back (1900/01; cat. 1), Nude in Profile (1903\u201304; cat. 4), Boats (1905; cat. 5), Grounded Fishing Boat (1905; cat. 6), Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907; cat. 12), Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool (1910; cat. 13), Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back (c. 1908; cat. 15), Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with Sketch of a Foot (Aug. 1909; cat. 16), and Girl with a Cat (1910; cat. 17).
