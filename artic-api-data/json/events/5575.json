    "description": "<p>Join Caitlin Haskell, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, and Jennifer Cohen, assistant research curator, as they discuss the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/9713/salvador-dali-the-image-disappears\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Focusing on the pivotal decade of the 1930s, when Salvador Dal\u00ed emerged as the inventor of his own personal brand of Surrealism, this careful selection of 25 extraordinary artworks from the Art Institute and collections around the world considers Dal\u00ed\u2019s work in light of two defining, if contradictory, impulses: an immense desire for visibility and the urge to disappear.</p><p>We encourage you to <strong>visit the exhibition before the lecture, if possible</strong>. We are anticipating high attendance for the Dal\u00ed exhibition on the day of this event, especially immediately following the member lecture. </p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong> In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination, though anyone who would like to wear a mask is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 in the week before your visit, we ask that you stay home.&nbsp;We appreciate your help in keeping the museum a healthy and safe place for our staff and visitors.
