    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Around the year 1800, Napoleon and his army entered Egypt, where they were fascinated by the ancient ruins they saw. The Western imagination seized on the engravings published by French artists in the campaign. Images of the splendid ruins became an inspiration for ladies' fashion, art, the opera, philosophy, and furniture. And that brings us to this sideboard. It was made in Philadelphia or Baltimore, for the home of Doctor and Mrs. Rich. The workmanship is of the highest order, using selected and expertly matched cuts of mahogany. The grain of the wood forms a decorative pattern of its own. Even more striking is the front of the large doors at either end, the raised panel on each door is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. This shape is based on an Egyptian pylon, the immense entrance many stories high, to a huge temple or monument in Ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian reference is the claw feet below the pylons. Motifs like these were very much the fashion in the early 1800s.</p>\n",
