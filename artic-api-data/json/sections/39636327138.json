For this vignette he used the back of the same block on which he carved Mahana atua four years earlier (cat. 80). On the same side, he also carved a second vignette, Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available wood block was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers onto his prints. The block is extant, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 120.3.2). In impressions of the third state, negative space has been created around the word Taiti. The artist carved away part of the block to increase the contrast between his inscription and the background.\n\nThe artist pasted an impression of the third state of this print onto page 188 of his manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 120.3.3),which suggests that it held particular significance for him. A detail of the lower left of that impression highlights the subtle, and often obscured, PG monogram and the flourishes around it (fig. 120.3.4).\n\nFox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues of Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThis third-state impression is printed in black ink. The gaps in the printing that read as white lines are indicative of the seams of the boxwood segments where ink did not deposit when rolled across the surface of the block.\n\nThe thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper was irregularly trimmed so that part of the border of the abutting vignette is visible along the bottom edge and increases the overall image size significantly. Where more of the border is visible, so too is the pieced construction of the block. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block.\n\n117 \u00d7 186 mm (image); 149 \u00d7 230 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.

IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 120.3 Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit, headpiece for Le sourire (The Smile), 1899/1900.\n\nfig. 120.3.2 Paul Gauguin (French, 1848\u20131903).
