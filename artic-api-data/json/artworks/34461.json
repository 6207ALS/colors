Their familial pose and other details, such as the woman\u2019s gold ring and the red mark on the girl\u2019s hand, invite speculation as to their relationship to each other and to the artist. Technical analysis has revealed that Paul Gauguin reworked the position of the woman\u2019s hands to align diagonally with those of the young girl standing behind her. Together, they form an upward axis reinforced by the cat, also a later addition.</p>\n",
