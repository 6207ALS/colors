    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Man Ray, the surrealist artist and photographer produced this chess set out of brass, silver and gold in 1926. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: It was inspired by some of the objects in Man Ray\u2019s studio. If you look at the knight, you see it has a kind of scroll form like a violin. He thought the form looked like a horse and, so, he used this found object in place of a more familiar one. For Man Ray chess was more than an intellectual pursuit, though he loved to play the game. It was also something artist. Man Ray often instructed his students as one of their very first lessons when they worked with him to lay out a chess board, to actually think about the chess board like a painting. Chess playing was a way to free the mind that could allow us to move in all directions. It involved chance, it involved creativity, it involved improvisation and it also involved very popular surrealist themes, those of violence and sexuality and battle.&quot;</p>\n",
