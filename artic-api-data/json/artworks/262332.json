    "description": "<p>Mary Reynolds (1891\u20131950), an American expatriate in pre-World War II Paris, befriended and supported many contemporary artists, including Marcel Duchamp, Jean Cocteau, Raymond Queneau, Max Ernst, and Man Ray. She was also Marcel Duchamp\u2019s companion from 1923 until her death. This collection includes letters from Duchamp and Alexander Calder, photographs of Reynolds and her Parisian friends, and government documents recording her activity in the French Resistance. It also includes acquisition documents concerning the livres d\u2019artiste collection of Surrealist book bindings by Reynolds and other Surrealist publications now housed in the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries. The Duchamp material covers a private aspect of his life not well represented in other collections. A special issue of the Art Institute\u2019s Museum Studies journal titled \u201cMary Reynolds and the Spirit of Surrealism\u201d (Vol. 22, No. 2, 1996) and a website about the Reynolds book binding collection provide additional information about Reynolds and her interest in Dada, surrealism, and livres d\u2019artiste.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Reynolds,%20Mary,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Reynolds,%20Mary,%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/reynolds/\">Detailed website.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
