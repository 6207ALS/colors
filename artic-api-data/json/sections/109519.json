At lower right is a cannon/animal hybrid based on a foreground figure in Jacques Callot\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony (see fig. 1). This sheet also includes, at left, part of the sawfish\u2019s rostrum and the train engine from sheet 3A.\n\nThis sheet alludes to modern technology, travel, and the latest developments in aerodynamics, the hot-air balloon (which continues up into folio 2B/C) renders the setting of The Temptation contemporary. Hot-air balloons were used during the Franco-Prussian War to send communications (often by pigeon) and also helped some Parisians escape the besieged city (see fig. 2). Balloons were often reproduced in illustrated journals and posters, and their exhibitions, races, and crashes were featured frequently in the news (see fig. 3), including in stories about the latest technological advances in aviation. The hot-air balloon also served as the setting for contemporary plays, such as Jules Verne\u2019s 1883 K\u00e9raban-le-t\u00eatu (Keraban the Inflexible; see fig. 4).\n\nEnsor\u2019s deflating balloon is attached to both a traditional basket gondola and an enclosed vessel resembling a steam-powered ship or paddleboat, more commonly associated with airships and dirigibles. The rostrum of the sawfish in sheet 3A has upended the basket and the vessel so that they have disgorged their passengers. The gondola resembles those on early innovations like the Eagle (see fig. 5). Hot-air balloons also inspired fanciful designs combining engineering and imagination. These included the ship-shaped gondola of the Minerva (see fig. 6).\n\nThe British inventor Sir George Cayley, the father of fixed-wing flight, was the first to recognize that the success of the dirigible (or controllable) balloon depended on the development of an engine with a high power-to-weight ratio (see fig. 7), but his experiment with a hot-air engine and a piston engine using gunpowder failed. Albert and Gaston Tissandier designed an electric-motor-powered dirigible that they successfully launched in 1883 (see fig. 8).\n\nBelow, floating near the gondola of the hot-air balloon, is an elephant with a howdah (the seat mounted on its back). As colonial empires expanded in the nineteenth century, elephants became allied with the exotic, entertainment, and spectacle, their lumbering bodies put to work clearing jungles (see fig. 9), transporting goods (see fig. 10), and providing elevated views for touring aristocrats (see fig. 11) and visitors to zoological gardens (see fig. 12). This included Brussels\u2019s Royal Zoological Garden founded by King Leopold II and located near the home of Ensor\u2019s friends Ernest and Mariette Rousseau, whose salon he attended regularly. Elephants were also popular attractions at traveling circuses and for viewing at magic lantern shows (see fig. 13). The animal could also allude to the elephant owned by Phraortes, king of the Ganges, in Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony.\n\nThis sheet is technically similar to others in this row and parts of rows 4 and 5, where Ensor laid out the composition in black colored pencil and graphite before adding colored pencil sparingly to certain areas. He added greenish-blue and red colored pencil over the dark lines of the composition. The absence of media along the top edge suggests the composition was elaborated further with colored pencil after the work was joined to the mount. SMC/KJN\n\nThe action in sheets 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, and 4C is the source of the engraving Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels (fig. 14). It also indirectly inspired other etchings, such as The Terrible Archer (fig. 15), Cataclysms (fig. 16), Wizards in a Squall (fig. 17), and The Elephant\u2019s Joke (fig. 18). Although Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels is not a direct reproduction of these sheets, the chaotic composition and frightful elements are similar to Saint Anthony\u2019s torments. Many motifs appear in both the print and the drawing, for example, the hot-air balloon, train, sawfish, headless bodies, octopi, insects, elephant, and submarine.\n\nIn the drawing the chaos is somewhat contained by the use of schematic registers, but in the etching Ensor dispensed with the organizational structure and allowed the chaos to become overwhelming. Sources of inspiration for the chaos include The Fall of the Rebel Angels by Pieter Bruegel I (fig. 19); versions of the temptation after Pieter Bruegel (fig. 20), by Martin Schongauer (fig. 21), and by Jacques Callot (fig. 22); and battle scenes by the Japanese artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada (fig. 23 and fig. 24). These artists provided ideas about overlapping, clashing compositions that Ensor assimilated into his own work. He interpreted these sources to offer viewers a distilled representation that condenses the energy, imagination, anxiety, and virulence of its predecessors. Thanks to this synthesis, the image possesses its own logic and magic that captivates even as it amuses and overwhelms viewers with its detail. ST\n\nfig. 1 Jacques Callot (French, 1592\u20131635).
