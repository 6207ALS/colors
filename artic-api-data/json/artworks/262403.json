    "description": "<p>While maintaining a private architecture practice in Chicago, L. Morgan Yost (1908\u20131992) served as editor for Small Homes Guide and consulting editor of Household Magazine, publications that produced and sold Yost\u2019s plans for small homes. In 1952, Yost and D. Coder Taylor (1913\u20132000) formed the architectural partnership Yost &amp; Taylor, specializing in commissions for modern affordable housing; the partnership dissolved after eight years. Taylor continued in private practice and Yost devoted much of his time to preservation activities in Chicago, saving the historic Glessner house, designed by H.H. Richardson, and serving as director of the Chicago Architecture Foundation. Both Yost and Taylor were elected Fellows of the American Institute of Architects. The collection contains correspondence, project files, photographs, lectures, and articles documenting the careers of both architects.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Yost%20and%20Taylor%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Yost%20and%20Taylor%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Yost,%20L.%20Morgan/field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">L.
