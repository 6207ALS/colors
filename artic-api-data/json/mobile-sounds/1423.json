    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The exquisite details in these two busts demonstrate the artist Charles Cordier\u2019s desire to capture the exact appearance of the East African man known as Said Abdullah and unknown African woman. Notice the diagonal patterns of fabric design faintly scored across the folds of the woman\u2019s wrapped gown. The male bust is also finely detailed. At the figure\u2019s neckline you can see the individual strands of the tassels that adorn his cloak. Cordier\u2019s precision had as much to do with the mid-nineteenth century interest in ethnology as it did with sheer artistry. As the official ethnographic sculptor to the museum of natural history in Paris Cordier meant to use his art as a way of documenting foreign cultures, tribes and races in an era of colonial occupation. On the other hand, these two busts were celebrated for their universal qualities of beauty. When the male bust of Said Abdullah appeared in the Paris salon of 1848, the exhibition catalog remarked upon the nobility of his expression and compared it to a Roman emperor. The bust of the woman was originally titled in English, \u201cAfrican Venus\u201d a name that conjures a mythic European idea of perfect beauty as well as the subject\u2019s African origins.</p>\n",
