    "description": "<p>In a career spanning four decades, James Casebere (American, born 1953) has become known for his pioneering work with constructed photography. Casebere produces increasingly complex tabletop architectural models that he photographs in his studio, creating evocative and haunting images of empty spaces. By reducing the built environment to its essential forms, he calls attention to conventions of photography, architecture, and sculpture. His more recent work has also explored the social implications and power dynamics of institutional spaces and systems. </p><p>His work has been associated with the Pictures Generation of postmodern artists who emerged in the 1980s, including Barbara Kruger, Robert Longo, Richard Prince, Cindy Sherman, and Laurie Simmons. Casebere has received numerous fellowships, including three from the National Endowment for the Arts, three from the New York Foundation for the Arts, and one from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. His work is collected by museums worldwide, and has been the subject of important survey exhibitions internationally. Casebere was born in East Lansing, Michigan, and currently lives and works in New York.</p><p>Presented by the <a href=\"/support-us/art-interest-groups/photography-associates\" target=\"_blank\">Photography Associates</a> at the Art Institute of Chicago</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a>&nbsp;as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"/visit/accessibility\" target=\"_blank\">Accessibility page</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>",
