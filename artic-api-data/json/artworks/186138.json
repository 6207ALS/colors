The commune, still in formation as of this writing, owns seventy acres of land.\n\nFollowing an early Jewish rule that presages modern sustainable farming practice, every seventh year they will let their land lie fallow. In accordance with the Torah, the \u201ccorners\u201d of their fields will be left to the poor\u2014if no poor show up to glean, the produce from the corners will be donated to charity. As Orthodox Jews they cannot milk cows on Saturdays, so gentiles will perform the task on that day. Their kosher organic chickens will not be fed grain during Passover. The community plans to be self-sufficient, with a synagogue, schools, a ritual bath and a swimming pool (the Talmud, a body of Torah interpretation, says that children must be taught to swim).\n\nEretz HaChaim is part of a larger return to a Jewish farming tradition. Sweet Whisper Farm in Readsboro, Vermont, specializes in organic education and maple syrup harvested using horse-drawn wagons. Mitzva Farms in Waukon, Iowa, produces Yetta\u2019s Chedda, A Bis\u2019l Swiss\u2019l and Mazel Rella.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
