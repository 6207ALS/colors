    "title": "On the Wall of Van Gogh\u2019s Bedroom",
    "copy": " Pictured above is Van Gogh\u2019s first Bedroom painting. He made it over two days in October 1888 (a week before Gauguin arrived at the Yellow House) and the painting is now in the collection of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. There are many subtle differences between this painting and the subsequent two versions, but one of the most obvious is the portraits on the wall. In the second and third versions, the top row of paintings includes a self-portrait and a picture of an unidentified woman. In the first painting though, Van Gogh has painted portraits of two men. And these portraits are based on actual portraits that Van Gogh painted earlier that year. We\u2019re also lucky enough to have both of those paintings in Van Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms .   The painting above is of Belgian painter Eug\u00e8ne Boch. As Van Gogh described him, he was \u201can artist friend who dreams great dreams, who works as the nightingale sings.\u201d As is true of many of Van Gogh\u2019s paintings during this time period, he pairs complementary colors\u2014in this case blue and orange\u2014to create a vivid effect. He also replaces the mundane studio background with the nighttime sky, placing Boch as a star in the heavens.   After completing Boch\u2019s portrait, Van Gogh searched for a subject whose personality could serve as a contrasting pendant. He painted Lieutenant Paul-Eug\u00e8ne Milliet, a member of the Zouaves\u2014French soldiers serving in North Africa. Milliet\u2019s boisterous personality was opposite to Boch\u2019s more sensitive introversion. This painting is another study in complementary colors, with the red k\u00e9pi against a vibrant emerald background. Van Gogh called this painting The Lover to portray Milliet as the embodiment of a masculine ideal. \u2014Katie Rahn ",
