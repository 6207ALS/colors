    "description": "<p>Julia Fish: bound by spectrum, presents a fully-illustrated survey of the last decade of Fish\u2019s paintings and works on paper. It offers new scholarship around Fish\u2019s ongoing project that brings together the disciplines of painting, drawing, and architecture. For three decades, Fish has used her house and its vernacular architecture\u2014a Chicago storefront workspace designed by Theodore Steuben in 1922\u2014as the basis for a system of mapping color, form, and light in paintings and works on paper. Working from close observation, she renders architectural details at actual size and creates a dialog between objective information and subjective response. These works are informed by effects of light in space, time of day, the seasons, cardinal direction, and the artist\u2019s own physical vantage point. Accompanying the images of Fish\u2019s works are essays by Julie Rodrigues Widholm, Kate Nesin, and Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn, images and text by architect Dan Wheeler, and a selection of the artist\u2019s studio notations.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.5 x 11 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:&nbsp;</strong>120</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong>&nbsp;30 color plates</li></ul>",
