    "description": "<p>Childe Hassam, like other American Impressionists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, recorded scenes of leisure and recreation, especially country vacation retreats. This painting portrays fashionable Bailey\u2019s Beach in Newport, Rhode Island, an exclusive seaside town known at the time for its wealth and luxury. Hassam depicted sand dunes rising from behind the beach with the promenade and its costumed bathers at a distance, reinforcing the fact that he, and the viewer, are excluded from this privileged setting. The artist\u2019s Impressionist strategies\u2014including the use of scintillating colors, energetic brushwork, and a light palette\u2014capture the vibrant atmosphere of this sunny resort.</p>\n",
