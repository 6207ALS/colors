(sheet very irregularly cut)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Edward McCormick Blair, 2002.256  \nGu\u00e9rin 29, Kornfeld 14 IV/IV, B  \nFor the verso, see fig. 56.3.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">One of the most inventive printing campaigns of the late nineteenth century, Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite distinguishes itself as an enterprise in which the artist worked freely and experimentally with a wide range of papers, disparate media, and unconventional printing and transfer techniques to produce a multitude of impressions. Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the blockcarving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer and stenciling techniques, as seen in this fourth\u2014and final\u2014state impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land). The group spans the entire Noa Noa Suite, with representative impressions printed with the same combination of materials and techniques from each of the ten blocks. After satisfactorily arriving at a final composition on this block, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing it two times, each time with the block significantly askew of the printing below it (fig. 56.3.2). He did so over a dimensional, bright-red medium applied with the aid of a stencil to color the wings of the lizard.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 56.3.3).\n\nFour different layers of media are present in this print. Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from a piece of glass (see fig. 56.3.4). The printing ink in this layer has a fluid appearance and was applied evenly and selectively over much of the block. Vermilion in an oil-based medium containing nondrying or semidrying oil and/or animal fatty acids and traces of conifer resin (probably pine resin) was applied with a stencil. Zinc white was added to the vermilion as an extender. It lightened the tone and provided opacity. Atop these layers of colored media, the block was printed twice, first in an iron oxide\u2013containing printing ink that is deep-yellow ocher in tone, then in carbon black printing ink that contains some Prussian blue.\n\nThe good-quality, medium-weight Japanese paper is well sized with a slight sheen overall that is visible in raking light. Long paper fibers are visible under magnification and in transmitted light an irregular shu (mold) impression can be seen with a shu interval of 34 mm where measurable. The top and right edges are deckled, although damaged from previous mounting. The left and bottom edges are irregularly cut and at first glance also appear deckled. However, closer examination reveals that these edges were more likely torn by hand. There is a significant amount of paper remaining around the printed image. There is a pattern of creasing along the edges, which indicates that the sheet was folded and wrapped around card stock and adhered at the edges to the verso of the card in the past.\n\nThe sheet has a warm gray tone due to discoloration and embedded surface dirt. It is identical to the paper used to print an impression of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.4). In both impressions the blocks were printed twice over a bright-yellow tone block and additional media were added using stencils.\n\nFor the verso of the sheet, see fig. 56.3.1.\n\n359 \u00d7 207 mm (image); 392 \u00d7 250 mm (sheet, max.) (sheet very irregularly cut). Tone block printed in yellow, 357 \u00d7 202 mm. Key block printed in ocher with masking, 353 \u00d7 183 mm. Key block printed in black, 353 \u00d7 204 mm.\n\nThis impression was printed in three colors\u2014bright yellow, yellow ocher, and black. In order to fully assess these layers, surface shape studies were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the topography of the various media as they sit on the surface of the paper (see fig. 56.3.5). This study revealed that the first layer of media applied to the paper was bright chrome yellow, and it was applied overall by means of transfer from a tone block, used to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper or another wood block; however, it is more likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. The use of a tone block can be confirmed by the appearance of the yellow behind the trees in the background where it does not conform to the shape of the trees, but instead silhouettes them against a broad, blocky yellow tone (fig. 56.3.6). The ocher and black ink were then printed respectively from the block that contained the image.\n\nGauguin\u2019s unconventional methods are evident in the way he inked the key block in two successive printings and positioned the image on the sheet. In his first printing of the key block he covered the ornamental border on the left so that the ocher ink layer would not visually interfere with the yellow tone that he had printed in that area first (fig. 56.3.7). He also positioned the key block that contained the ocher ink one-eighth inch above the area where he had printed the bright-yellow tone block. Following this, he reinked the key block in black and again shifted its position so that it was printed one-quarter inch above the yellow ocher. While the end result looks random, careful inspection of the sheet in transmitted light reveals four minute pinholes in the four corners of the image that were likely used for registration. Two additional pinholes at the centers of the top and bottom of the sheet may well have been used for registration as well.\n\nEach printing of the block is deliberately and significantly off register and results in an overall impression of movement and flickering light.\n\nGauguin added a pair of widespread red wings over the chrome yellow using a stencil to isolate this part of the composition. The placement of the stencil is one-eighth inch below the related contour in the block. In cutting the stencil Gauguin carefully avoided the right contour of the standing figure\u2019s head. The consistency of the red medium differs from the printing inks and contains nondrying or semidrying oil, animal fatty acids, and trace amounts of conifer resin (probably pine resin).<sup></sup> It has been diluted or solubilized with solvent to alter the medium\u2019s consistency further. This resulted in pronounced staining on the verso (fig. 56.3.8). The appearance of this stenciled red medium is identical to that found in the dorsal fin of the fish in the foreground of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54.3). In both impressions, the stenciled medium has the same surface quality and has stained the verso of the paper in much the same way. Whether this staining is due to the oil in the medium, the solvent used to dilute the medium and solubilize the oil and resin, or a combination of both is impossible to definitively establish. Yet there is no doubt that the red passages in both prints were created using stencils and the medium Gauguin chose for both was manipulated in the same way to obtain a similar viscosity.\n\nOn the verso, the artist\u2019s handprint appears in bright yellow in the upper left corner. With the sheet turned and the handprint oriented in the lower right, it seems that the artist used his left hand to hold the sheet in place while using his right hand to apply pressure to the paper to print the block (fig. 56.3.9).\n\nIn anticipation of exhibition in 2002, the print underwent conservation treatment to soften the appearance of pronounced creases in the sheet.\n\nThe print is in good condition. Much can be ascertained about the history of this print by close inspection of the paper. At some point the sheet was mounted to a secondary support. There are a series of creases along the edges that point to this, especially along the right edge where the support was once folded over. In addition, there are a number of creases (now reduced through conservation intervention) that indicate that the sheet was once folded into eighths. Three former horizontal creases appear through the center, one 8 cm above the bottom edge and one 10 cm below the top edge. There is a vertical crease that runs the length of the sheet through the center. In raking light the series of creases that resulted from folding the sheet into eighths, the embossment pattern created during the printing process, and the fibrous appearance of the paper become more pronounced. In transmitted light the fibrous quality of the sheet is more apparent, as is some of the damage the sheet sustained in the past.\n\nWithin the image area the sheet has faded slightly with overexposure to light. Under ultraviolet light the sheet fluoresces unevenly as a result of this overexposure in areas that were not protected by the face mat. Around the image there is a quarter inch of paper that fluoresces a bright bluish-white\u2014the same area that appears faded in visible light. Along the right edge some residual adhesive fluoresces bright bluish-white. Similar fluorescence on the verso of the sheet appears brightly on all edges and is further evidence of the mounting described above.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged line-icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF, Raman microspectroscopy, and FTIR analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis reflectance transformation imaging (RTI/photometric stereo) research project was undertaken at the Northwestern University/Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts (NU-ACCESS), generously funded through a grant from the Andrew W.
