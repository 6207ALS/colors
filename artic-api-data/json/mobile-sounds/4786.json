    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>In this series of videos featuring white type on red backgrounds, Pledge, Will, and Vow run through, respectively, the traditional language of a final will and testament, marriage vows, and the Pledge of Allegiance. Once again, the new works animate old ones but in this case deconstruct and disrupt familiar phrasing with jarring adjustments such as, \u201cI PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC/RESENTMENT/RETRENCHMENT/RESILIENCE/RESISTANCE/REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS/ FALLS/FAILS/SURVIVES/STANDS. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p>The three flat-screen works unfold in the same gallery: first Pledge plays, then Vows, then Will, and finally all three rewind together. Also installed in this space is Kruger\u2019s Untitled (Our people), a digital print on vinyl featuring white type against a red background. It reads, OUR PEOPLE ARE BETTER THAN YOUR PEOPLE. MORE INTELLIGENT, MORE POWERFUL, MORE BEAUTIFUL, AND CLEANER. WE ARE GOOD AND YOU ARE EVIL. GOD IS ON OUR SIDE. OUR SHIT DOESN\u2019T STINK AND WE INVENTED EVERYTHING.</p>\n",
