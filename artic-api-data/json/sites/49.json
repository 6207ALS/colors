    "title": "Bertrand Goldberg: Architecture of Invention",
    "description": "Architect Bertrand Goldberg\u2019s dramatic sculptural forms and innovative engineering have long been recognized as seminal contributions to the built environment of Chicago, most notably his groundbreaking design for Marina City (1959\u20131967). This exhibition, the first comprehensive retrospective of the architect\u2019s work, positions Goldberg\u2019s career within a broad historical framework that extends from his experimental origins at the Bauhaus in Germany and the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition to his visionary plans for the postwar American city.",
