    "transcript": "<p>blooming in blue</p>\n<p>shadow shifting across pastures.<br>here, where windblown wildflowers cast waving<br>silhouettes. the spring blossoming, rife with hope,<br>where blue sky was home to the robin, with its<br>round eggs of smooth sapphire, cradling the seeds<br>of a future in its fragile shell. where blue sky was<br>the background to the beauty, where greatness was<br>not found in shadows and the hollow clang of a<br>tolling clocktower, but in rippling pools of black and<br>white fabric, a monochrome memory of a woman<br>dressed for timeless remembrance, where all the<br>girls who wished to dream of greener pastures<br>could make their homage and say I could be here<br>too.</p>\n<p>a spring florescence for every girl who stood before<br>her, and remembered that strength could come in<br>different shades, that power could be found in<br>Color. that Her own potential energy was endless,<br>bound only by Her convictions and ambitions, a<br>quiet promise that Her worth was greater than the<br>spaces between words and a serif font. that blue,<br>which was the wisdom and the unwavering whisper<br>that one day It could be me too. (I could be great<br>too.)</p>\n",
