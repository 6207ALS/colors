    "description": "<p>During her early Impressionist period, Mary Cassatt frequently captured the activities of middle- and upper-class women in society\u2014at the theater or taking tea, for example. <em>On a Balcony</em>, which was shown in the 1880 Impressionist exhibition, appears to depict a woman in a public setting. However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman\u2019s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman\u2019s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt\u2019s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.</p>\n",
