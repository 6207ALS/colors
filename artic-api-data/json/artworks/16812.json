    "description": "<p><em>The Outlook, Maine Coast</em> depicts two young women bracing themselves against the wind on a high overlook at Prout\u2019s Neck, Maine. Rather than focusing on what the women are watching, Homer chose to explore the act of looking. Homer, a keen and thoughtful observer himself, was fascinated with the experience of watching.  In this watercolor, he associated visual observation with physical sensations: the feeling of strong breezes, moisture in the air, and the chill of an overcast day.  Because it allowed Homer to work outdoors quickly, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#watercolor\">watercolor</a> was the perfect medium to make these atmospheric effects tangible and immediate. In <em>The Outlook, Maine Coast</em>, Homer was especially successful in creating the sense of moving air.  The low vantage point also contributes to the emphasis on the windy sky of gray and pink clouds.</p>\n",
