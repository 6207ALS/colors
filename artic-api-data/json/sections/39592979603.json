Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis first-state impression of Te atua (The God) is among those printed in the earliest phase of carving and compositional development of the blocks. Gauguin usually printed his proof impressions of early states on one of three types of pink paper or on tan wove paper, all of inferior quality. All are found only in early-state impressions. For this first-state impression, the artist printed the block in a straightforward manner in black ink alone on the sturdy tan wove paper that he favored for proofing.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 53.1.2).\n\nThis first-state impression was pulled from a block that was inked in an oil-rich, carbon black printing ink. Gauguin used ink with a high viscosity that could flow over the surface of the wood and into its interstices. As a result, the silhouetted forms have almost no articulated detail (fig. 53.1.3). The choice of ink was a technically deliberate one, since it was necessary to condition the block by allowing it to absorb and retain oil so that additional media applied prior to printing would sit evenly on the surface. This is commonly referred to as \u201cbringing the block up to color.\u201d\n\nGauguin printed this impression on a moderately thick, smooth, tan wove paper. Paper of this type was very popular among printmakers in the nineteenth century. It was favored for its strength and sheet tone. Great variation in quality existed between sheets of this type of paper, ranging from fine imported Japanese vellum sheets to papers manufactured in the West that simulated the look of these Japanese vellums. Gauguin\u2019s choice here is of the latter: a more common type of vellum paper in which the paper fibers are distributed evenly and the paper is of a uniform color. This is confirmed by transmitted-light examination. The paper is heavily sized. As a result, it remained deeply embossed from the pressure exerted on the sheet during the printing process. There is a slight sheen to the surface when the sheet is examined in raking light. The edges are straight cut, although slightly irregular. The paper has been trimmed close to the printed image, with a remaining paper margin approximately 1\u20132 mm wide around the image on all sides. The paper is identical to that used for a second-state impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56.1), and a second-state impression of Noa noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.1). All are similarly embossed. Another first-state impression of Te atua in the Kupferstichkabinett, Staatliche Museum, Berlin, is very similar to the Chicago impression. It was also printed on the same type of paper, under a similar degree of pressure, and has the same deep embossment.\n\n203 \u00d7 354 mm (image); 207 \u00d7 358 mm (sheet)\n\nMany areas of detail, present in later state impressions, have yet to be resolved in the wood block, although from the outset the positions of the three main figure groups are well established (fig. 53.1.4). Substantial pressure was exerted on the block, as evidenced by the presence of deep embossment visible on both the recto and verso of the sheet (fig. 53.1.1). Examination of the verso reveals that more pressure was exerted on the right side of the block, an indication that Gauguin printed the block oriented vertically rather than in the horizontal orientation of the composition. With the block and the sheet of paper perpendicular to him, the pressure he exerted closer to his body was greater than the pressure he exerted as his arm extended away from him. In raking light the pronounced embossment is more visible and the various degrees of embossment can be differentiated. The paper, identical to that used for several other impressions in the Chicago collection, exhibits similar deep embossment.\n\nClose examination of the print reveals flaws in the impression from the manner in which the block was inked. Such imperfections are common when a block is inked for the first few times, and they document that the new block accepted the ink very unevenly. This is most visible along the right edge of the composition, along the bottom edge, and in the lower left corner. In this early-state impression the block was still being brought up to color and the black ink was only starting to absorb into the wood; as a result the ink did not deposit evenly overall. This is very obvious along the bottom edge, along the left edge at center, and directly in the center of the composition, where a series of striations from the rings in the wood block appear (fig. 53.1.5). In the lower left corner, it is evident that the block was slightly warped or out of plane such that complete contact with the roller could not be achieved. This resulted in a square passage that lacks the same amount of ink as found elsewhere in the print (fig. 53.1.6). However, as the block was brought up to color and additional impressions were pulled, this flaw vanished. The first-state impression in the Staatliche Museum has similar flaws in the same areas, and they are even more pronounced than those in the Chicago impression. This suggests that the Chicago sheet may have been the second of these two first-state impressions to be printed. Gauguin took another first-state impression, cut it down, and pasted the figural group at left into his manuscript, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 53.1.7). Even in this fragment, the uneven, flawed printing is visible, especially along the left edge.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. The surface has numerous burnish marks that are especially visible in dark passages. These formed when other materials, like mat board, were rubbed across the surface of the print, leaving shiny marks. They appear throughout. A vertical crease through the center indicates that the sheet was once folded in half. The crease carries a slight accumulation of surface dirt on the verso. There are three additional large diagonal creases that formed during the printing process. These appear along the top to the right of the inscription. Two smaller creases appear along the left side, one 53 mm down and the other 98 mm down from the top left. On the verso there are numerous old hinges as well as a strip of old, yellowed glassine tape. This tape holds in place two tears in the upper right. On the recto, these look like fine fractures and are devoid of media. The old tape also deformed the sheet along the entire width of the top edge. The lower right corner on the verso is abraded where old paper tape was removed. In the lower left corner on the verso a piece of this paper tape remains. There are three very small pinholes along the bottom edge at center, but only one goes all the way through to the verso. There is a small brown stain in the bottom right on the verso. When examined under ultraviolet light nothing fluoresces, and the sheet displays an even tone with no foxing or staining visible.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed.

Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nGauguin pasted a fragment cut from the right side of a first-state impression into folio 31R of the same volume. Presumably the fragments were cut from the same impression.\n\nBarbara Korbel, outgoing condition report, Aug. 2006, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDouglas W.
