    "description": "<p>Marcel Wanders\u2019s tableware for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines includes utilitarian but luxurious pieces that were designed to reduce the load of the aircraft and streamline the work of the flight crew, thus resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions and more efficient service. Most important, however, was to maintain a superior quality so that diners felt like honored guests, rather than routine passengers. Whimsical details on the fabric tray liners and flatware handles are reminiscent of traditional Dutch lace, imparting a sense of elegance and tradition to the dining experience. Most items are made of traditional materials such as crystal, porcelain, and glass, with the exception of the plastic salad bowl.</p>\n",
