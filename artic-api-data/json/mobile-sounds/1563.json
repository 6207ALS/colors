    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This painting, once the center of a large altarpiece, was made in Barcelona, Spain in the early 15th century.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: It depicts St. George who came to the aid of a town menaced by the terrible dragon he is now about to kill. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: According to the story, every day the dragon had to be placated with a victim chosen by lot, and on this day the lot fell to the princess, the daughter of the ruler of the town. And we see the princess, a lovely figure in the middle distance in a pink robe with fluffy red hair and a crown. Strewn around the foreground are the bones and relics of the dragon's victims, as well as lizards that seem to be sort of little baby offspring of the dragon that are emerging from the cave opening where the dragon lurks.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  In the background is the walled town whose inhabitants, including the princess's parents, crowd onto the battlements to view the dragon's dramatic end. The artist, Bernat Martorell, used an unusual technique of raised gesso or plaster for the dragon's spiny back and St. George's halo, armor and horse trappings. This gives the painting a strong, almost sculptural feel.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: It would probably have been even more vivid originally, because what now appears to us to be the black armor of St. George was actually silver, and the blackness comes from the tarnishing that's taken place over time with the silver.</p>\n",
