    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A seated female figure on a pediment of the acropolis inspired this Roman copy from the second century A.D. The head and arms, now lost, were originally separate pieces fastened to the trunk with cement and dowels. The Romans freely adapted Athenian sculptures of the golden age for a variety of new purposes. This elegantly draped figure sits on a rock rather than a thrown. This suggests that the statute commemorated a goddess or perhaps a deified Roman Empress. Karen Manchester:</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: We do know that the Romans were particularly fond of Greek sculpture and many ancient works that were made by Greek artists are lost to us. Many of them were made in bronze which either disintegrated or was melted down for other purposes. But we know an awful lot about how these sculptures look because the Romans adored them to the point that they actually made many copies of them. And I use the term copy very, very, very loosely because they\u2019re not necessarily exact replicas of the works of art. Sometimes they make variations in them to suit their own purposes. It\u2019s one of our particular strengths in our Roman collection is that we do have many pieces that are based on Greek originals.</p>\n",
