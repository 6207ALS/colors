    "description": "<p>This landscape was painted by the young Jan van Scorel as he traveled from northern Italy to Rome to study antiquities and the new Renaissance style. It was executed on poplar, a type of wooden support common in Italy, and its elongated format suggests that it was set into paneling as part of a room decoration. The painting celebrates two aristocratic pastimes, jousting and hunting; Scorel used a 1506 woodcut by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34071/lucas-cranach-the-elder\">Lucas Cranach the Elder</a> as the model for the lively crowd watching the joust. Italian patrons were particularly drawn to the Northern European vision of chivalric subjects and courtly pursuits, and the jousting theme was no doubt requested of the young Dutch painter, who showed a talent for combining small active figures in a landscape setting.</p>\n",
