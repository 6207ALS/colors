    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Director James Rondeau.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: There is obviously something sinister about a six-foot toddler. There\u2019s almost kind of a mutant quality to him. You don\u2019t want to run into a six-foot boy in a dark alley. Something is clearly wrong.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This work by Charles Ray is part of the final chapter in the story of the Edlis-Neeson Collection: how contemporary artists interpret pop strategies.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: This is a work of art that is being drawn from commercial mass cultural imagery ... in this case it\u2019s an object based upon a department store mannequin.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Charles Ray made this facsimile after carefully studying exactly how mannequins are produced.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: At first blush it\u2019s ... cheery, it\u2019s almost kind of comical in its kitschy quality. What could be more innocent than childhood? But there are a number of things wrong with this object.</p>\n<p>He\u2019s being dressed in a way for adults but also to kind of convey some sort of notion of idealized boyhood, of politeness, of perfection to adult audiences. It really speaks to the way often in pop culture or in individual life that the idea of childhood can be fetishized to become something that is actually the opposite of what it should be, something innocent and joyful to become something really constructed and artificial.</p>\n<p>And suddenly that finger becomes a sort of strange accusatory gesture that is completely contradicted by the kind of almost dumb smile on his face. All the way around this figure I think explores why we find these kinds of objects to be disturbing.</p>\n",
