The son of Charles Pollitt of Thorny Hills, Kendal, Westmorland, he entered Trinity College in 1889. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1892 and his master\u2019s degree in 1896, but failed to qualify as a doctor. Pollitt counted among his friends several prominent members of the Aesthetic movement, including Aubrey Beardsley, Oscar Wilde, and Herbert Home. He formed an art collection of some note, which included etchings and a drawing by Whistler, a number of Beardsley\u2019s drawings, and a Pierre Bonnard screen.\n\nNo correspondence between Whistler and Pollitt regarding the lithograph survives. It may be that the commission was handled by the Fine Art Society. In early March Marcus Huish of the Fine Art Society had drafted a notice announcing that Whistler would accept work as a portrait lithographer (see cat. 146 and cat. 147). Although the artist ultimately decided against advertising his services in this manner, it is quite likely that the Fine Art Society mentioned the project to clients and visitors attending the 1895\u201396 exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs.\n\nThe date and location of Pollitt\u2019s sitting for this portrait are securely documented. On January 31 Whistler sent a note to Huish informing him that John Singer Sargent had lent him space in his studio on Fulham Road. He asked the dealer to send the studio address \u201cto Mr. Pollitt of Cambridge,\u201d whom he would expect at noon on the following Tuesday (4 February 1896). The portrait that resulted from this meeting was certainly the image transferred to stone by the Ways a week later, on February 11 (app. II.4). After the drawing was transferred, scraping was used to establish highlights in Pollitt\u2019s right hand, hair, and left ear, and along the left side and sleeve of his coat. No impressions have been located to indicate what the drawing looked like prior to these changes.\n\nThat both artist and sitter were dissatisfied with the portrait is indicated by the very small number of proofs pulled of the image, as recorded in T. R. Way\u2019s 1905 catalogue. A second portrait of H. C. Pollitt drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal was never transferred (dwg. XV). In this drawing the young man is shown seated, wearing the same light-colored overcoat he sports in the standing portrait. The small, seated portrait is less labored and more assured in its handling than the present image, and it is surprising that Whistler never had it processed and proved. After failing to produce a satisfactory portrait of Pollitt in lithography, Whistler set out later the same year to paint his likeness on canvas. He worked sporadically on a now-lost oil portrait (YMSM 452) between September 1896 and 1900. Eventually, he abandoned the project and returned the 200 guineas that he had received in advance from the Fine Art Society on Pollitt\u2019s behalf.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 228 mm); MWC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 227 mm), signed.
