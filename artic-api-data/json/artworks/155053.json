    "description": "<p>The aim of the Chicago War Memorial competition was to \u201cadequately memorialize the sacrifices and services of all who served in the world\u2019s war and in a manner relating not inharmoniously to the adjacent architectural and landscape elements of Grant Park and the yacht harbor.\u201d The memorial was to be constructed on a man-made island in Lake Michigan across from Buckingham Fountain.  The competition resulted in 114 entries that were narrowed to four finalists by the jury.  Finally, a scheme by the New York architects Eric Gugler and Roger Bailey was selected.  Second place was awarded to Benjamin H. Marshall, a Chicago architect.<br>Bruce Goff and Alfonso Ianelli, who worked together on this competition, were not recognized by the jury.  However, their scheme is an interesting result of the combination of Goff\u2019s creative approach to architecture and Ianelli\u2019s talents as a designer and artist.<br>The first place design\u2019s high cost, estimated to be between two and five million dollars, and the economic depression of the 1930s meant that no monument was ever executed.</p>\n",
