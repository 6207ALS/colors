    "description": "<p>An avid angler and sportsman, Homer often depicted fishing and hunting scenes in his artwork. Many of his watercolors that explore these subjects were painted on frequent trips to the Adirondack Mountains. <em>Netting the Fish</em> is unusual in its focus on a gentleman sportsman. Young, well groomed, and neatly attired, the fisherman in this watercolor stands in contrast to the rustic guides featured in many of the artist\u2019s other Adirondacks works. Homer\u2019s fluid brushstrokes describe the smooth surface of the water, and his background washes evoke the wooded shoreline seen at a distance. <em>Netting the Fish</em> is one of Homer\u2019s few grisaille, or monochrome, watercolors, painted as a study of values in preparation for the etching <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189219/fly-fishing-saranac-lake\"><em>Fly Fishing, Saranac Lake</em></a>.</p>\n",
