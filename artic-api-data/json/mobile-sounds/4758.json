    "transcript": "<p>THIS TIME</p>\n<p>Roses are red,<br>Orchids are violet,<br>Shall these flowers bloom in Silence?</p>\n<p>A geometric dress housed<br>Sitting In a fleet of showers,</p>\n<p>Him, he sits in a sea of flowers,<br>An ocean, waves on the ready,<br>A pale blue beneath the shapes ever so steady, The colors dashing and prancing around, Dancing emotions with frowns upside down, He may sit on a throne but he has no crown, He sits one with his people,<br>Alongside the vessels of Freedom,<br>A physical embodiment of Independence Dependant on each other,<br>And one another exclusively.</p>\n<p>Colorless albeit is she?<br>The reds mixing with the pinks and limes, Blacks and Whites Checkerpatched in a line, Circles, Squares, and Triangles,<br>Only what we need is shown this time<br>Our time to shine.</p>\n<p>Both, star shining,<br>Starring the sun rising,<br>Setting an example for those who climb, From dusk till dawn they age like wine,<br>Time is Time, Time this Time,</p>\n<p>This time we move as one,<br>In this time we run as one,<br>Whether we have two feet each,<br>Or two eyes one nose,<br>No matter how different we look or different we see, We shall be one this time,<br>This time whether we\u2019re the flowers fallen behind, Or we\u2019re the flowers carrying the one in the chair, We will sit as one, here, outside, everywhere.<br>This time whether the blue is a solid color,<br>Or the dress is mostly addressed as white,<br>We will stand knowing the same reds inside of us are in sight,</p>\n<p>We are one within,<br>The same color, The same Kin,<br>Albeit different color,<br>We are all humans embedded in flowers and skin,</p>\n<p>Whether you do good\u2026<br>Or whether you sin\u2026<br>You and Me\u2026<br>Him and Her\u2026<br>Belong in this Grand City of Winds.</p>\n",
