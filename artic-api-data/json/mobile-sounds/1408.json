    "transcript": "<p>JAY XU: This wonderful figure has an Indian name Arhat. In Chinese it\u2019s called aluohan. It\u2019s a Chinese transliteration of an Indian term.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Jay Xu, Pritzker curator of Asian Art. Arhat\u2019s or aluohan\u2019s were the original disciples of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>JAY XU:  It\u2019s most remarkable for its lifelikeness and very, very strong sense of a realism and also a wonderful sense of the moment.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This really is a speaking likeness. He might be about to give a sermon or perhaps he\u2019s chanting to achieve enlightenment. Take a look at his neck. The tear reveals the underlying fabric on which the artisan applied layers of lacquer a very toxic substance when liquid. The core, perhaps of clay, would have been modeled from life perhaps from a monk. This bust was probably once part of a very impressive life size figure. The portrait like quality of the aluohan\u2019s features reminds us that it was, after all, individuals who traveled the Silk Road and who brought with them their beliefs about the world along with artistic styles and commercial goods.</p>\n",
