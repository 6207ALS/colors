Although executed in brush and wash, the composition relies on line rather than tone conveyed through passages of fluid wash. The artist extended the sheet by adding a 6 cm strip of paper along the top edge.\n\nThe design was drawn directly with brush and black wash and no preliminary guide. Matisse achieved volume in the figure by shading with loose, parallel brushstrokes. Intersecting and overlapping brush marks describe the shape and design of the fabric covering the chair. The deepest black shadows along the figure\u2019s proper left side were built up through multiple applications of discrete brushstrokes rather than solid applications of wash. Repeated parallel lines were also used to distinguish the chair from the background. Matisse used a drier brush throughout, which accentuated the linear texture of the laid paper as the brush touched the high points of the surface and left the interstices white. There is a broad, loose, active quality to the brushed lines that constitute the composition.\n\nThe paper strip attached to the top edge was added after the composition was already well developed. All brushstrokes along the top edge of the primary sheet terminate on the deckle edge and do not extend onto the secondary strip (as would be the case if the artist had added the strip prior to starting the drawing). Matisse painted the strip before it was attached. Microscope examination at magnification 80\u00d7 shows that some brush marks on the strip, such as those to the left of the head, extend under the deckle edge of the primary sheet, which would have been impossible if the pieces were joined first. Matisse used the same type of paper for the addition (the same watermark appears in both pieces). He carefully aligned the laid lines in both papers. Then, probably holding the addition in place by hand, he registered its position with dabs of black wash, bridging the joint to the right and left (see fig. 8.1), and sketched the top of the head on it. The media on both sheets appears to be the same.\n\nWith the aid of the registration marks, the sheets were joined using a 1 cm wide strip of dry mount tissue, likely during mounting. The discrete edge of the dry mount tissue extends from between the primary support and the added strip on the left (see fig. 8.2). It has darkened to brown and appears as a linear stain along the joint between the two sheets.\n\nAt one point the drawing was dry mounted overall to a white paper mount, now removed, as indicated by a layer of dry mount tissue on the verso (fig. 8.3) with white paper fibers embedded in it. Examination reveals that lines at all edges were cropped when the pieced support was trimmed, most likely in preparation for mounting. Several of Matisse\u2019s smaller drawings from this period are also dry mounted.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 8.4).\n\nBrush and black wash.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory laid paper. Chain lines run horizontally at 2.7 cm intervals. The laid line frequency is 9/cm. The paper is moldmade. Under ultraviolet light at 254 nm the support exhibits an even, whitish fluorescence from the paper sizing. The primary sheet measures 60.5 \u00d7 47 cm. The attached strip, of the same paper, measures 6 \u00d7 47 cm with a 0.5\u20131 cm overlap. The top of the primary sheet is a deckle edge. All other edges were trimmed, cropping the composition. The original dimensions of the primary sheet are unknown, but comparison with similar papers suggests that it is close to its original size.\n\nA watermark appears along the lower right edge: Ingres 1862 (45 \u00d7 130 mm) (fig. 8.5). A countermark of a shield with a caduceus and the initials \u201cC F\u201d (6 \u00d7 5 cm) appears near the upper right edge (fig. 8.6). There is an identical, partial watermark in the upper left corner of the pieced strip (fig. 8.7). The watermark Ingres, honoring the artist Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, was used by multiple manufacturers to designate high-quality, textured, laid paper intended for drawing. The countermark is the symbol of the paper distributor Catel &amp; Farcy. The date 1862 is not the year the paper was made (Catel &amp; Farcy was established in 1886), and so may hold other significance.\n\n66 \u00d7 47 cm (26 \u00d7 18 1/4 in.).\n\nThere is no record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. Examination reveals that the drawing was once mounted and that the mount was later removed. Lines of the composition are cropped at all edges, indicating that all sides of the pieced support were trimmed at some point, likely in preparation for mounting. There is a discrete layer of dry mount tissue on the verso with white paper fibers from a former mount embedded in it.\n\nThere are scattered tan foxing spots throughout, most evident along the left edge, below center. The edges of the sheet have darkened. There is a 5 cm, old, embedded crease in the lower right quadrant, 5 cm from the right edge and 14 cm from the bottom edge. There is a 2 cm tear from the left edge, 13 cm from the bottom edge, that has been mended. There is a 0.2 cm loss to the left edge, 9.5 cm from the top edge. There is a discolored piece of dry mount tissue on the verso of the top edge of the primary sheet. It appears as a dark-brown stain where the two sheets of paper are joined.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from the artist by Dr. Heinz Braune (born Hans Heinrich Braune-Krickau, 1880\u20131957), Breslau (present day Wroc\u0142aw, Poland) and Stuttgart, Germany, by 1922\u2013Oct. 5, 1929.\n\nSold to Galerie Thannhauser, Berlin, Amsterdam, and New York, Oct. 5, 1929\u2013Dec. 28, 1944.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 28, 1944, for $750.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Berlin, Galerien Thannhauser, Henri Matisse, Feb. 15\u2013Mar. 19, 1930, cat. 107 (ill.), as Akt im Lehnstuhl.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings Old and New, Feb. 16\u2013?, 1946, cat. 36, pl. 28, as Nude in Armchair.\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse, Nov. 13, 1951\u2013Jan. 13, 1952; Cleveland Museum of Art, Feb. 5\u2013Mar. 16, 1952; Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 1\u2013May 4, 1952, addendum to catalogue, no cat. no., as Nude in Armchair (c. 1906); San Francisco Museum of Art, May 22\u2013July 6, 1952 (Chicago only).\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, Les Fauves, Oct. 8, 1952\u2013Jan. 4, 1953, p. 47, cat. 114, as Nude in Armchair, c. 1906; Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Jan. 21\u2013Feb. 22, 1953; San Francisco Museum of Art, Mar. 13\u2013Apr. 12, 1953; and Art Gallery of Toronto, May 1\u2013May 31, 1953.\n\nArts Club of Chicago, Les Fauves, Jan. 10\u2013Feb. 15, 1956, cat. 21, as Nude in Armchair, approx. 1906.\n\nRotterdam, Museum Boymans, Franse tekeningen uit amerikaanse collecties: Van Clouet tot Matisse, July 31\u2013Sept. 28, 1958, cat. 202, pl. 181, as Naakt in een stoel, c. 1906; Paris, Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, 1958\u20131959 [as De Clouet \u00e0 Matisse: Dessins fran\u00e7ais des collections am\u00e9ricaines], cat. 202, pl. 204, as \u00c9tude de femme nue, c. 1906 and Nu endormi; and New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Feb. 3\u2013Mar. 15, 1959 [as French Drawings from American Collections: Clouet to Matisse], cat. 202, pl. 181, as Nude in a Folding Chair, c. 1906.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein and Company, Master Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 17\u2013Nov. 30, 1963, cat. 151, as Nude in Armchair, c. 1906.\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse Retrospective 1966, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 142 (ill.), as Nude in a Chair/Nu endormi dans une chaise, (1905); Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966; and Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\nBaltimore Museum of Art, Matisse as Draughtsman, Jan. 12\u2013Feb. 21, 1971, cat. 15 (ill.), as Nude in a Folding Chair, ca. 1906; San Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Mar. 20\u2013May 9, 1971; and Art Institute of Chicago, May 26\u2013July 10, 1971 (fig. 8.8).\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019art moderne, Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture, May 29\u2013Sept. 7, 1975, cat. 24 (ill.), as Nu dans une chaise pliante, ca. 1906; Brussels, Palais des Beaux-Arts, Sept. 27\u2013Oct. 26, 1975 [as Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture/Tekeningen en sculpturen], cat. 22 (ill.), as Nu dans une chaise pliante, Naakt in een klapstoel, ca. 1906.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Dessins fran\u00e7ais de l\u2019Art Institute de Chicago de Watteau \u00e0 Picasso, LXII Exposition de cabinet des dessins mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Oct. 15, 1976\u2013Jan. 17, 1977, cat. 79 (ill.), as Nu sur une chaise-longue, vers 1906.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, St\u00e4dtische Galerie im St\u00e4delschen Kunstinstitut, Franz\u00f6sische Zeichnungen aus dem Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 10\u2013Apr. 10, 1977, cat. 80 (ill.), as Weiblicher Akt, im Liegestuhl schlafend/Nu endormi dans une chaise, um 1906.\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse: A Retrospective, Sept. 24, 1992\u2013Jan. 12, 1993, cat. 69 (ill.), as Nude in a Folding Chair/Nu dans une chaise pliante, [early 1906].\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Roland Schacht, Henri Matisse, K\u00fcnstler der Gegenwart (Rudolf Kaemmerer Verlag, 1922), p. 62 (ill.), [81], as Aktstudie.\n\nGalerien Thannhauser, Henri Matisse, mit Geleitwort von Prof. Hans Purrmann und 64 Abbildungen, exh. cat.

See \u201cMounting Evidence.\u201d\n\nDescriptions of paper thickness and texture follow the standard set forth in Elizabeth Lunning and Roy Perkinson, The Print Council of America Paper Sample Book: A Practical Guide to the Description of Paper (Print Council of America/Sun Hill, 1996).\n\nIn comparison, Pablo Picasso\u2019s Head of a Woman (1909; Art Institute of Chicago) was made on a sheet with a similar, but not identical, Catel &amp; Farcy countermark. That sheet measures 62.5 \u00d7 48 cm, and only the top edge was trimmed (the width is unchanged from the original sheet dimension).\n\nLaid drawing papers watermarked Ingres are still produced today by multiple manufacturers.\n\nCatel &amp; Farcy was one of the largest paper distributors in France at the turn of the twentieth century and contracted with paper mills to produce papers with their mark; see Natalie Coural, Dominique Cordellier, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Grollemund, Le papier \u00e0 l\u2019oeuvre (Hazan/Louvre \u00c9ditions, 2011), pp. 94\u201395.\n\nIt can be determined that this sheet was produced prior to 1906 because \u201c(FRANCE)\u201d does not appear in the watermark below the shield. It was added in 1906 as a result of U.S. tariff laws requiring the country of origin to be clearly identified in watermarked papers. \"Le Secretaire-Adjoint du Tr\u00e9sor, Reynolds d\u00e9cide que les papiers \u00e0 fillgranes contenant des lettres ou des chiffres doivent porterle nom du pays d\u2019origine\u201d \u201cDouanes \u00c9trang\u00e8res,\u201d Bulletin-Journal du fabricants de papier, no. 23 [bulletin, vol. 22/journal, no. 52] (Dec. 1, 1905), p. 7.\n\nGalerie Thannhauser, undated collection history; and Zentralarchiv des internationalen Kunsthandels ZADIK, Cologne (Thannhauser stock book 2); photocopies in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.
