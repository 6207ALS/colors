Its continued success has demonstrated that private residential development can be ecologically sound while providing real community.\n\nVillage Homes is situated in California\u2019s Central Valley, where temperatures in excess of hundred degrees are common during the long summer season. Automobile roadways in the development are much narrower than those in typical suburban communities and only thirty-two of seventy acres contain houses, therefore the urban heat island effect is significantly reduced. Ambient air temperatures can be as much as fifteen degrees lower than those in nearby conventional neighborhoods; utility bills for air conditioning tend to be fifty percent less.\n\nThe fight with the city of Davis to approve narrower streets was hard won (succeeding because of European research demonstrating that they were safer), as was the struggle for above-ground water drainage in natural swales. These are earthen embankments that hold and conserve rainwater and return it to the ground. Shortly after they were finally approved and built, the embankments\u2019 worth was demonstrated when Village Homes was one of the few areas in Davis left undamaged by flooding after heavy rainfalls.\n\nEvery aspect of the development plan of Village Homes was designed to promote community, but none more so than the shared ownership and management of gardens, orchards and vineyards, also known as \u201cedible landscaping.\u201d Signs notify community residents when crops are ripe. Vegetables and fruit from more than thirty varieties of trees can be picked for free. Almonds, an important cash crop, are available for purchase at a fifty percent discount to those who help in their harvest.\n\nThe community\u2019s success may be measured by a study which shows that the average Village Homes resident knows forty-two of his neighbors, as opposed to seventeen in a standard suburban development. Similarly, a typical Village Homes resident maintains that four of his or her best friends live in the neighborhood, while in a conventional community this figure is 0.4.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
