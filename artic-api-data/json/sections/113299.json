It has diminished over time and is difficult to read under normal conditions, but with the aid of infrared reflectography, details are identifiable (fig. 1). A group of spectators stands in the lower left corner in front of a crescent moon, together with a menagerie of strange creatures, including birdlike beings and dragons, and various flying apparatus. Continuing the spreading, polluted cloud of sheet 4A, the sheet becomes a field for caprice and invention as a dense layer of insects, organisms, and strange hybrid forms (inspired by Jacques Callot\u2019s etching; fig. 2) mutate from human to animal to insect as they fly across the sky. The composition relates only minimally to adjacent sheets: part of the crescent continues into sheet 4A; the tail of a creature in sheet 3B appears at center top; and the central figure at the bottom extends into sheet 5B. This sheet is half of a folio page, as evidenced by the irregularly formed right edge. SMC/KJN\n\nThe action in sheets 3A\u00ad, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, and 4C is the source of the engraving Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels (fig. 3). It also indirectly inspired other etchings, such as The Terrible Archer (fig. 4), Cataclysms (fig. 5), Wizards in a Squall (fig. 6), and The Elephant\u2019s Joke (fig. 7). Although Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels is not a direct reproduction of these sheets, the chaotic composition and frightful elements are similar to Saint Anthony\u2019s torments. Many motifs appear in both the print and the drawing, for example, the hot-air balloon, train, sawfish, headless bodies, octopi, insects, elephant, and submarine.\n\nIn the drawing the chaos is somewhat contained by the use of schematic registers, but in the etching Ensor dispensed with the organizational structure and allowed the chaos to become overwhelming. Sources of inspiration for the chaos include The Fall of the Rebel Angels by Pieter Bruegel I (fig. 8); versions of the temptation after Pieter Bruegel (fig. 9), by Martin Schongauer (fig. 10), and by Jacques Callot (fig. 2); and battle scenes by the Japanese artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada (fig. 11 and fig. 12). These artists provided ideas about overlapping, clashing compositions that Ensor assimilated into his own work. He interpreted these sources to offer viewers a distilled representation that condenses the energy, imagination, anxiety, and virulence of its predecessors. Thanks to this synthesis, the image possesses its own logic and magic that captivates even as it amuses and overwhelms viewers with its detail.
