This funerary statue, owned by a woman named Asetirdis (\u201cIsis is the one who gave her\u201d), depicts the god Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. A composite of Ptah (a creator god), Sokar (the patron deity of the necropolis west of Memphis), and Osiris (the ruler of the underworld), Ptah-Sokar-Osiris\u2019s purview encompassed all phases of life, including rebirth. Shown in a mummified form, his red wrappings are covered in an intricate net of beads painted in blue, black, and yellow. A cavity in the statue\u2019s base was designed to hold a papyrus scroll inscribed with funerary texts or another sacred object to facilitate Asetirdis\u2019s rebirth after death.</p>\n",
