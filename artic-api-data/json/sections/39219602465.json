Chapman, 1950.1520\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Laid in with brush and a wash of dilute black watercolor, these two portraits form a study in contrasts. The young woman is worked over with brighter watercolors, gold and pink with the blush of youth, her blonde hair swept back with a comb and snood (fig. 20.1). The man is bald and bearded\u2014all gray and black and world-weary; concentrated medium applied with a dry brush lends his moustache the scratchy texture of graying hair (fig. 20.2 and see Compositional Development in the technical report). Where the young woman is somewhat generalized, the man is highly specific; where she is idealized, he is very nearly a caricature. Directly rendered without graphite underdrawing, both faces convey a sense of Manet\u2019s brisk observation, of the apparent wit and ease that he cultivated in his late watercolors. Like other brush drawings the artist made during this period, these designs might conceivably have been traced from more searching pencil sketches (e.g., fig. 20.3 and fig. 20.4). In particular, the precise, continuous profile of the man could suggest a tracing process, which would help explain the use of a semitransparent paper support. A horizontal crease runs through the center of the sheet (fig. 20.5) where Manet likely folded it in half before slipping into an envelope.\n\nThree inscriptions tell the story of this drawing. Two, scribbled in ink by the artist himself, explain its setting and hint at the sitters\u2019 identities. The first reads Bellevue / sur mer / Lundi (Bellevue / sur Mer / Monday), and the second, Les dineurs d\u2019hier / \u00e9crivez moi (Yesterday\u2019s diners / write to me). A third inscription, in pencil at upper right, offers the precise date of August 16, 1880, a Monday. This inscription is by a different hand, possibly that of the drawing\u2019s recipient, the correspondent whom Manet urged, \u201c\u00e9crivez-moi.\u201d These words echo a common refrain in the letters he wrote from Bellevue during the summer and fall of 1880. Sent by his physicians to the spa town west of Paris to undergo a course of water treatments for his paralyzed leg, the invalid artist grew lonely and despondent. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done,\u201d he wrote to his friend, artist and critic Zacharie Astruc, in July, \u201cthe countryside only has charms for those who are not obliged to stay there.\u201d He disliked the weather, the garden, and the solitude of the rented villa he shared with his mother, his wife, and her son L\u00e9on Leenhoff at no. 41, route des Gardes. He missed Paris and his friends, many of whom were spending the summer holidays at the seaside. Bellevue, a hundred-odd miles from the Normandy coast, was decidedly not \u201csur-mer\u201d: this part of the first inscription is a rueful joke, perhaps intended for a correspondent at the beach.\n\nThe handwriting in the graphite inscription bears a striking resemblance to that of an earlier graphite-inscribed date (25 juillet 80) that appears at the top of another Bellevue letter (fig. 20.6; [RW II 583]). That note was addressed to Madame Jules Guillemet, the charming co-proprietor of a fashion business who had posed with her husband for Manet\u2019s In the Conservatory (fig. 20.7; [RW I 289]), exhibited at the Salon of 1879. In the July 25 letter, Manet charged his correspondent to \u201csend word from time to time of the goings-on on the beach at Saint-Aubin,\u201d referring to the Guillemets\u2019 vacation spot: the Lower Normandy town of Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer. The Art Institute sheet, dated August 16 in the same second hand, was very likely destined for the same recipient, a missive from \u201cBellevue-sur-Mer\u201d to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer.\n\nIndeed, the individuals depicted in Head of a Woman and Head of a Bearded Man have often been identified as Monsieur and Madame Guillemet, who did visit the Manets at Bellevue that summer, once in early July and again in August or September, after their vacation. The watercolor blonde of the Art Institute drawing, however, bears little resemblance to Madame Guillemet, whom Manet portrayed as a brunette not only in the conservatory picture but also in several pastels (see, e.g., fig. 20.8; [RW II 37]) and in a watercolor illustration on the July 25 letter (fig. 20.6). The bald, grizzled man on the Art Institute sheet, moreover, appears a bit old to represent the same man as In the Conservatory, first exhibited just one year before, in which the gentleman sports a full, dark beard and an only very slightly receding hairline. Although shown at the Salon of 1879, In the Conservatory was well underway by the end of 1877. By the summer of 1880, therefore, Jules Guillemet\u2019s hairline may actually have had two years or more to retreat from the widow\u2019s peak captured in the Salon painting, and his beard, the same amount of time to turn from brown to salt-and-pepper. Thus it is perfectly conceivable that the caricature-like male head in this drawing belonged to Jules, treated by Manet (who was himself rapidly balding) with affectionate humor. Given Madame Guillemet\u2019s appearance in the illustration on the July 25 letter, however, the female head in the Art Institute drawing probably is not hers. It more plausibly belongs to her younger sister, Marguerite.\n\nMarguerite accompanied the Guillemets on their visits to Bellevue and seems to have returned to pose in the garden during their stay at the seaside. \u201cIt\u2019s settled, dear mademoiselle,\u201d Manet wrote to Marguerite in early July, \u201cmy mother asks me to tell you we\u2019re counting on you during your brother-in-law\u2019s stay at St. Aubin\u2014bring your needle-work and the light summer dress you told me about, and if you have a pretty garden hat, don\u2019t forget it. You\u2019ll have the f\u00eate at Bellevue during your stay.\u201d Two resulting pictures (fig. 20.9; [RW I 343] and fig. 20.10; [RW I 347]) give us little sense of Mademoiselle Marguerite\u2019s physical appearance. Manet was still at work on at least one of them in late August or September, when he wrote to the printmaker Henri-Charles Gu\u00e9rard, \u201cYesterday we had the Guillemets back from the seaside. I started something after the younger sister. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll have the time to finish.\u201d Nevertheless, the lace collar Marguerite wears in both paintings and the fair hair peeking out from under her \u201cpretty garden hat\u201d in the more close-up composition suggest a certain affinity with the blonde girl in the Art Institute drawing, where a delicate patter of gray wash suggests the model\u2019s wide, ruffled collar. Manet\u2019s lovingly applied watercolor here conveys a keen appreciation for his model\u2019s youthful beauty. A similar admiration is evident in a second note Manet addressed to Marguerite (fig. 20.11; [RW II 598]), openly flirtatious in tone and tinged with nostalgia for the possibilities of youth. This note\u2014adorned with a honeybee and daisies (marguerites in French) reads simply: \u201cI love you, surely someone will tell you this, Marguerite, I love you a little, a lot, passionately.\u201d\n\nOf course Marguerite was not the only pretty young woman Manet encountered during his stay at Bellevue, nor Jules Guillemet the only man of a certain age. As is so often the case in his late oeuvre, this sheet opens a tantalizing window onto the artist\u2019s private world but raises as many questions as it answers.  \nEmily A. Beeny\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">These two small sketches are stacked, in the center of the sheet, divorced from any context. Inscriptions describing the sitters as dinner guests appear in brown ink and pencil to the right of their portraits. The looseness of the drawings suggests that they were hastily composed.\n\nWatercolor with brown ink and graphite inscriptions.\n\nThe support is a cream, thin, slightly textured wove paper. The paper is of consistently even formation, and the furnish is uniform and without inclusions or colored fibers. While both the left and right edges of the sheet are slightly irregular, the left edge gives the impression that it was torn from either a larger sheet or binding. Head of a Woman and Head of a Bearded Man relates in size to a number of other letters and small sketches that Manet composed at Bellevue (fig. 20.12). The similarities in the physical descriptions of these papers suggests that Manet was using the same notebook or set of stationery to write his missives. While several other extant letters have nearly identical dimensions, some are twice the width, suggesting that these larger sheets represent a full piece of stationery or complete folio from a notebook (fig. 20.6), while the smaller letters, like this one, are half-sheets or single leaves.\n\nThere is no visible evidence of an artist-applied coating or ground. With UV light the paper exhibits a mild yellow visible-light fluorescence (fig. 20.13). The fluorescence is mottled and may be the result of a sizing agent or uneven penetration of the paper by the adhesive that was used to attach the secondary support.\n\n201 \u00d7 124 mm\n\nAdjacent to the head of the woman, and in brown ink with the date in graphite pencil: \u201cBellevue/sur mer/Lundi/16 ao\u00fbt 80.\u201d Adjacent to the head of the man, and in brown ink: \u201cLes dineurs d\u2019hier/ecrivez-moi.\u201d\n\nThe artist used dilute black watercolor to describe the woman\u2019s head, her upswept hairstyle, and the collar and front of her dress or shirt. The same dilution is used in the description of her hair, hair ornament, and the delicate coloring of her cheeks, nose, and lips. Four distinct colors were employed, both independently and as mixtures: yellow and an ocher appear in her hair; a cool, alizarin-like red denotes the hair clasp or tie; the skin tone is indicated by a faint reddish-orange wash along the nose and chin with more concentrated color in the cheeks and lips; and the ear is modeled with ocher and orange washes (fig. 20.14).\n\nThe outlines of the bearded man are laid down in a darker black watercolor. The dome of the man\u2019s bald pate is shaded with dilute media, as are his cheeks and the length of his beard. Various concentrations of the same media distinguish his moustache and hair. Concentrated watercolor, applied with a dry brush, punctuates his eyes and mouth, the end of his beard, and his shirt collar.\n\nIn both sketches, watercolor is applied in an additive manner. No subtractive techniques are present.\n\nThere are no revisions or changes to the sketches. Similarly, there does not seem to be any evidence of underdrawing.\n\nThis work was conserved at the Art Institute in preparation for the exhibition Manet and Modern Beauty in 2019. The primary purpose of treatment was to remove remnants of a secondary support from the verso, including a partial sheet of pale pink wove paper and the residual adhesive that was used to adhere the two sheets. A secondary objective of the treatment was to remove yellow discoloration, an oxidation product of degraded cellulose, from the paper in order to improve its overall tone. Removal of degradation products via aqueous treatment resulted in an overall lightening of the paper, bringing it much closer to its original color. This also had the added benefit of increasing the contrast betweent the media and the support.\n\nPrior to treatment in March of 2019, there was no record of treatment since the work entered the Art Institute's collection in 1950. However, as noted, there was clear physical evidence of the sheet's removal from a mount. During that process, the backing was reduced to an uneven layer of paper \ufb01bers, and probably smoothed with sandpaper. In some areas, such as along the left verso edge, only adhesive remained and the primary support was visible. Also visible on the verso was a small square of thin paper that was used to mend a break in the upper right quadrant. This small break and a small edge tear were both repaired with conservation-quality materials during the recent campaign of treament.\n\nThe support is in good condition overall. Its cream tone and translucency have been restored by the treatment described above. There is still a faint rectangle of discoloration around the perimeter of the sheet due to prolonged contact with acidic housing materials. Two small pinholes are visible along the upper edge of the paper, immediately above the woman\u2019s head. A single pinhole is present in both heads; immediately below the man\u2019s beard is another pinhole. A very small hole, approximately 1 mm in diameter, is located in the bottom left corner, roughly 1 cm from the left edge. There are two very small tears in the bottom edge, both close to the left corner. There is a horizontal crease from folding in the center of the sheet.\n\nThe media is in good condition, though it is likely that some of the watercolor pigments have faded with time and exposure to light. The brown ink inscriptions tested negative for the presence of soluble iron with test paper, suggesting that the ink is not iron gall. However, formal scientific anaylsis was not carried out.  \nMary Broadway, with Rachel Freeman\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Jacques Blot, Paris, 1930\u2013at least 1931.\n\nAlbert Roullier Art Galleries, Chicago, by Nov. 1931.\n\nMrs. Charles B.
