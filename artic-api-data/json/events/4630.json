    "description": "<p>James Meyer, curator in the Department of Modern Art at the National Gallery, presents this year's Carol Given Winston Lecture, focusing on material from his new book, <em>The Art of Return</em>. In this book, Meyer turns to art criticism, theory, memoir, and fiction to examine the continual fascination with the 1960s, a decade that has captured our collective cultural imagination. </p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
