    "copy": " Dear Art Institute, Your graphic on your home page has a typo. You are calling yourself the Art \u201cInstitvte\u201d of Chicago. It is a pretty huge error. Just thought you would like to know. This email echoes the most commonly asked question to my department: did you know that your logo is spelled incorrectly? We always reply to the people who ask, but for all of the people out there who didn\u2019t feel compelled to write us, the answer to that question is a definite \u201cyes.\u201d But because we do understand why there might be confusion, we thought we would set the record straight and give you a little background on our logo.   Our logo was redesigned by Pentagram in 2008. And while it has a modern sensibility and was created in anticipation of the opening of the Modern Wing in 2009, Pentagram was inspired by the facade on the museum\u2019s original building (see above). If you look at the text above the banners, you\u2019ll notice that the museum\u2019s name is spelled with a Latin \u201cV.\u201d This is a nod to the classical architecture of the building, as the uppercase \u201cU\u201d wasn\u2019t introduced until the 16th century.   Note that this convention extends not only to the museum, but also to the artists\u2019 names that run across the upper border of the facade. If you look at the architrave of the building the next time you\u2019re here, you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s no \u201cU\u201d in sight! \u2014Katie Rahn ",
