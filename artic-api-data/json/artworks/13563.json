    "description": "<p>The young Austrian-born Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph was controversially installed as Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1864 in an attempt to create a European-style monarchy there, backed by Napoleon III of France and a cohort of monarchists. Seen as part of a European imperialist campaign, Maximilian\u2019s rule was considered illegitimate by those who opposed the French occupation of Mexico. This work interprets the young ruler\u2019s execution in Quer\u00e9tero, Mexico, on June 19, 1867, alongside generals Miguel Miram\u00f3n (left) and Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda (right). \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s composition was inspired by not only history painting and the iconography of Francisco de Goya but also contemporary journalism and the budding field of newspaper photography. One controversial aspect of this print is the presence of French troops in the firing squad rather than those of the Mexican Republic. The lithograph was censored by the French government and was not publicly printed until after Manet\u2019s death.</p>\n",
