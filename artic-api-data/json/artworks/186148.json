In the course of his work, Mockbee, a fifth generation Mississippian, had observed the deep social and economic inconsistencies of life in the South, and he was anxious to do something in response. With this sense of mission, he and D.K. Rath, an architecture professor and long-time friend, founded the Rural Studio\u2014essentially an architectural practice for the impoverished, in which students and teachers live in the rural South and build for, and with, their clients. Homes, churches and community centers are constructed to meet real needs and, at the same time, the highest standards of architectural theory and aesthetics. To make this feasible, most building materials are donated or found. Hale County, Alabama, the place chosen for this experiment, has its own symbolic meaning: Walker Evans and James Agee documented it in the 1930s, in what would become the American classic, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.\n\nThe Rural Studio has built more than nine residences and twenty community projects. Typical of them is the Mason\u2019s Bend Community Center, whose glazed wall is made from the windows of Chevy Caprice Classics\u2014purchased from a junkyard in Chicago on an \u201call you can carry out for a buck\u201d day.\n\nOther notable projects include the Lucy House, made from seventy-two thousand recycled carpet tiles; the Shiles House, built in a wet and flood-prone landscape on top of telephone poles, with exterior stairs supported by recycled automobile tires, and an exterior clad in oak shingles cut from wooden shipping platforms; the Sanders-Dudley \u201cRammed Earth\u201d House, constructed from a cement-soil mixture that hardens into a kind of man-made rock; and the Bryant \u201cHay Bale\u201d House, whose twenty-four-inch-thick walls are formed by bales of hay covered with concrete. The \u201cHay Bale House\u201d also has a separate smokehouse, built for a total cost of $40 out of broken concrete provided by the Hale County Highway Department, and a roof of salvaged road signs.\n\nSamuel Mockbee died of complications from leukemia in December 2001. Winner of a MacArthur \u201cgenius grant,\u201d he was also posthumously awarded a gold medal from the American Institute of Architects, joining previous recipients Frank Lloyd Wright, Louis Sullivan, Le Corbusier and Louis I. Kahn. He believed that \u201ceverybody wants the same thing, rich or poor\u2026not only a warm, dry room, but a shelter for the soul.\u201d\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
