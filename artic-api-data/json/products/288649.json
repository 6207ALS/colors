    "description": "<p>Elegant yet dainty at its core, the Aster is a beautiful daisy-like flower with yellow centers and ray-like petals. Part of the same family as Sunflowers, the Aster\u2019s name originates from the Greek word for \u201cstar\u201d as a reference to the flower\u2019s star-shaped flower heads. The uniqueness of the Aster or Sunflower family is that each flower is composed of many small flowers in a disk-like flower head. Even the petals are individual flowers.</p>\n<p><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Asters are often considered a symbol of elegance, love, and patience. Additionally, each color holds further meaning.
