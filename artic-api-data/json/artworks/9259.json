    "description": "<p>Guanyin is the Bodhisattva of Compassion, one of the most beloved Chinese Buddhist deities. He can be identified by the small figure of Amituo (Amitabha), Buddha of the Western Paradise, in his headdress. His pose\u2014seated with one leg hanging and his right arm resting on the other knee\u2014further distinguishes him as Guanyin of the Southern Sea, a reference to the deity\u2019s island home. The figure\u2019s gentle expression makes an emotional appeal to the viewer, which is typical of Chinese sculpture from the Song dynasty (960\u20131279). The carving was originally painted with intricately patterned robes and traces of color are still visible on his back. Later\u2014probably during the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644)\u2014the wood was covered entirely with gold.</p>\n",
