Kubicek, 1982.206\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">In the first decade of the twentieth century, the Boston-based firm Shreve, Crump &amp; Low retailed extravagantly wide double-loop-handled silver bowls, some set with a semiprecious cabochon where each handle meets the bowl\u2019s lip. Historically described as \u201cjam\u201d or \u201cbutter dishes,\u201d they were assumed to have been made by their American retailers after designs by Charles Robert Ashbee, founder of the British Guild of Handicraft. Having been fabricated after the establishment of the Tariff Act of 1890, which required all imported goods to be marked with their country of origin in order to raise revenue and shield American manufacturers from foreign competition,and bearing no assay mark or other indication of foreign origin, the bowls were long accepted as evidence of Ashbee\u2019s direct influence on the American Arts and Crafts Movement.\n\nNumerous examples marked by the Guild of Handicraft exist in American and British collections. Some have covers embellished with enamels, others have handles set with semiprecious stones, while still others have only one handle. They were made from about 1900 to 1902 at the guild\u2019s Essex House location in London\u2019s East End and, from the summer of 1902 through about 1907, in Chipping Campden in the Cotswolds, where the guild had moved. Alan Crawford notes that the Shreve, Crump &amp; Low examples are \u201cidentical\u201d to the marked Guild of Handicraft objects but surmises that \u201cShreve, Crump &amp; Low were a reputable firm not likely to copy a designer\u2019s work without giving credit.\u201d He leaves the resolution of the question of authorship to future scholars.\n\nAshbee made four trips to the United States, where, among other venues, he lectured at the Society of Arts and Crafts in Boston. There, he made the acquaintance of Frederic Allen Whiting, director and treasurer of the society from its inception in 1897 until 1912. Arts and Crafts scholar W. Scott Braznell cites correspondence in which the two men discuss selling Guild of Handicraft silver through the society. Noting similarities of technique, style, and dimensions among the Shreve, Crump &amp; Low\u2013marked objects and examples marked by the Guild of Handicraft, Braznell concludes that there is \u201clittle doubt that the Shreve dishes were part of the Guild\u2019s production.\u201d Indeed, Ashbee had a significant incentive to develop an additional retail outlet; financial difficulties tied to the saturation of the British market for the guild\u2019s products ultimately resulted in its closing in 1907.\n\nAs has also been pointed out, Ashbee believed that the tariff on imported silver items was 60 percent; it was, in fact, 45 percent. This misunderstanding could have provided Ashbee even greater motivation to attempt to avoid the tax. It is likely, then, that the jam or butter dishes marked by Shreve, Crump &amp; Low, including the one in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, were produced by Ashbee\u2019s Guild of Handicraft and intentionally neither identified with the Guild\u2019s mark nor submitted to Goldsmith\u2019s Hall for English assay and date marks. How they might have been imported, lacking identification of their place of origin as was required by American law, remains unknown.  \nBarbara K.

He claimed to have registered the Guild of Handicraft mark, C.R.A., in 1888, but this did not occur until the end of January 1896. See Bury (1967), p. 20. As Bury also states, Ashbee was not alone in avoiding Goldsmith\u2019s Hall; in their defense, some silversmiths claimed they were simply trying to prevent damage to their wares from rough handling.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Two-Handled Dish, 1902/7.\n\nfig. 69.1 </section>",
