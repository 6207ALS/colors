    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Notice the meticulous details on this funerary urn called a soul jar. A prosperous house forms the lid. Below it are storage baskets, utensils and attendants, everything necessary to be comfortable in the afterlife. So you can take it with you.</p>\n<p>JAY XU:  Not only you can take it with you, you can take more than you had with you because by image making you\u2019re really entering into a realm of unlimited possibilities.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: That\u2019s Jay Xu, Pritzker Curator of Asian Art. Just above the urn\u2019s shoulders find the pointed vertical element supported by a turtle. Then look for the third figure to the left behind a shield. The bump of enlightenment on his head, the ushnisha identifies him as an enlightened Buddha. In the third century C.E. Buddhist images were just entering China along the Silk Road.</p>\n<p>JAY XU: The first step is always the transfer of the images, images that are carried by very concrete artifacts. The foreign deities were understood probably as a magical figure possessive of extra power.<br>Narrator:  The Buddhist view that life is suffering seems incompatible with traditional Chinese beliefs about the afterlife. However, the concept of rebirth which extends life after death permitted Buddhism to become fully absorbed into Chinese culture. Over the centuries, Buddhism would radically effect Chinese social structures, politics and art.</p>\n",
