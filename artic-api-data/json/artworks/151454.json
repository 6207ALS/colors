It was an era that saw the emergence of distinctly modern forms of cultural consumption: romances, sentimental novels and, most important, Gothic novels and plays focusing on themes of terror and the supernatural. As Fuseli\u2019s student Benjamin Haydon wrote, \u201cAmongst all classes [Fuseli] was considered a painter of horrors.\u201d</p>\n",
