    "description": "<p>Cornell began to make souvenir cases, such as this one, and other objects in tribute to the Romantic ballet in 1940, having begun to collect books, prints, letters, and photographs in the late 1930s. As Lynda Hartigan has pointed out, Cornell was un happy at \u201cnot being able to find more poignantly evocative, colorful trifles about its [the Romantic ballet\u2019s] ballerinas,\u201d and used his creations \u201cto fill that void\u201d (Washington, D.C., National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, <em>Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources</em>, 1982\u201383, exh. cat. by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, p. 36).</p>\n<p>Cornell\u2019s infatuation with the great ballet dancers of the past seems to have been no less intense than his devotion to ballerinas of his own time, like Tamara Toumanova. He collected material on Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and the subject of this box, Marie Taglioni. These were the pioneers and stars of the new style of dancing on point in the 1830s and 1840s, which accompanied a dramatic change in ballet, as \u201cmythological and classical themes gave way to plots based on dramatic love themes, fairy tales, and folk legends\u2014themes that treated the subject on two planes: the actual and the ideal, the flesh and the spirit, the real and the fantastic\u201d (Christine Hennessey, \u201cJoseph Cornell: A Balletomane,\u201d <em>Archives of American Art Journal 23</em>, 3 [1983], p. 8).</p>\n<p>Cornell, in fact, studied the entire cultural milieu of the Romantic ballet: that in-between world represented by the stage in the nineteenth century, where social and sexual taboos and restrictions were loosened; a world frequented by artists and writers, whose connoisseurs and balletomanes included such figures as the poet Theophile Gautier and the writer Hans Christian Andersen. Cornell devoted an entire issue of <em>Dance Index</em> (4 [Sept. 1945]) to Andersen, including a scenario, \u201cTheatre of Hans Christian Andersen,\u201d for a miniature theater presentation based on his fairy tales. \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d for example, is represented in this scenario by the Shadow Dance from <em>Ondine</em>, \u201cthe ballet created by Fanny Cerrito a hundred years ago,\u201d Cornell explained, \u201cwhich was based vaguely upon the Andersen tale\u201d (ibid., p. 158).</p>\n<p>Paper cutouts for miniature shadow theater by Andersen himself are reproduced in this issue (ibid., pp. 138, 144\u201345, 155\u201357) with Cornell\u2019s own comments: \u201cAnd little did these same huge hands dream they were creating in the paper silhouettes priceless pieces of collector\u2019s varia\u2014to enter a precious realm where the white baroque ballerinas invite a paperdoll Taglioni in rainbow costumes to join in their dance to the envious gaze of tiny twin Ellslers [<em>sic</em>] quivering in glass prisons\u201d (ibid., p. 139).</p>\n<p>The legend inscribed in the lid of <em>Homage to the Romantic Ballet</em> is based on an adventure told by Marie Taglioni of her encounter with a Russian highwayman who blackmailed her into dancing on rugs spread over the muddy road\u2014a story Cornell came across in J. Vandham\u2019s <em>An Englishman in Paris</em> (New York, 1892; see Hennessey, p. 9). The story became entangled in Cornell\u2019s imagination with the chance sight of a load of ice spilling from a truck at New York\u2019s Grand Central Station, which, he said, \u201cevoked in the most graphic manner the faerie of the Romantic ballet\u201d (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1066; cited in Hennessey, p. 9). Cornell announced in the October 1940 issue of <em>View</em> (\u201cAs We Go to Press,\u201d View 1, 2 [Oct. 1940], p. 4) that he was working on \u201ca box of ice-cubes encased in sumptuous blue velvet ... for ... Taglioni\u201d; this was the version known as <em>Taglioni\u2019s Jewel Casket</em> now in The Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York 1980 \u201382, no. 8 7, ill.), which was included in Cornell\u2019s <em>Exhibition of Objects</em> at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York, in December of 1940. One of the categories or work noted on the exhibition announcement was \u201cHomage to the Romantic Ballet: Marie Taglioni, Fanny Cerrito, Calotta Grisi, etc.\u201d The casket was purchased from this exhibition by James Thrall Soby, who gave it to The Museum or Modern Art in 1953. <em>Taglioni\u2018s Jewel Casket</em> has two necklaces, one of which is suspended inside the lid, in addition to sparkling glass gems, purchased from Woolworth\u2019s. In both boxes Cornell pasted the legend of the encounter between the ballerina and the highwayman, typed in light letters on a dark ground, so that even the text\u2018s appearance contributes to the atmosphere of a moonlit night. Cornell\u2019s version of the event, as Dickran Tashjian suggested, contains a \u201cbarely suppressed eroticism,\u201d which points to the \u201csexual charge of his ballet imagery\u201d (Tashjian 1992, p. 113).</p>\n<p>The evidence provided by the box itself indicate that <em>Homage to the Romantic Ballet</em> originally included twelve smaller cubes. There are in fact markings on the velvet lining in the lid of the box suggesting that it once contained twelve 1-inch cubes, and the lid cannot be closed while the present 1 1/4-inch cubes are on the glass because they are too large.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 45-47.</p>\n",
