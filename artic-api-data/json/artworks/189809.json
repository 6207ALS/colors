    "description": "<p>Konstantin Grcic\u2019s Mayday Lamp exemplifies the industrial designer\u2019s aspirations to rethink conventional products for the home. This portable lamp is probably his best-known work to date and was realized with the Italian design company Flos. A practical rendition of an industrial lamp made for domestic use, Mayday Lamp was born out of Grcic\u2019s dissatisfaction with contemporary lighting solutions. His love of Formula 1 racing, specifically the no-frills lamps employed by auto mechanics, served as a source of inspiration. Portable, funnel-shaped, and equipped with a hook that enables them to be secured under the hood of a car, these safety lamps provided the basis for Mayday. The large hook crowning the top of the lamp is functional, but it also acts as a decorative element in the uncluttered design.</p>\n",
