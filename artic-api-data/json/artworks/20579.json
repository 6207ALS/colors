Amidst towering, rocky cliffs, Hercules stands on the left of the painting, dressed in clothing that exposes his figure.

    "description": "<p>Gustave Moreau developed a highly personal vision that combined history, myth, mysticism, and a fascination with the exotic and bizarre. Rooted in the Romantic tradition, Moreau focused on the expression of timeless enigmas of human existence rather than on recording or capturing the realities of the material world.</p>\n<p>Long fascinated with the myth of Hercules, Moreau gave his fertile imagination free rein in <em>Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra</em>. Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra\u2019s seventh, \u201cimmortal\u201d head, which he will later bury.</p>\n<p>Despite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau\u2019s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting.</p>\n<p>Moreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns. He was profoundly affected by France\u2019s humiliating military defeat by Prussia in 1870\u201371. Whether or not Hercules literally personifies France and the Hydra represents Prussia, this monumental work portrays a moral battle between the forces of good and evil, and of light and darkness, with intensity and power.</p>\n",
