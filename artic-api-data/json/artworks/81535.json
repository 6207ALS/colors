It is one of three or four works that he painted in Paris from sketches made on a vacation with his family in the northern port of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Though boldly brushed and almost calligraphic in form, the vessels remain identifiable as specific types. A side-wheel packet steamer heads up the Channel, leaving the slower sailing boats in its wake.</p>\n",
