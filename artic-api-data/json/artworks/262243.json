    "description": "<p>Educated at Illinois Institute of Technology under Mies van der Rohe, Hammond first worked in the office of Eliel and Eero Saarinen and then at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill\u2019s Chicago office, where he was elected to partnership in 1961. Subsequently, he was a founding partner of Hammond, Beeby, Babka. Hammond\u2019s career typifies that of many mid-20th century architects: a post-Beaux-Arts education, experience in large architectural offices working on large projects, then the establishment of a small firm with a specialized \u201cboutique\u201d practice. The collection contains photographs of projects and business brochures from his various partnerships. Related material can also be found in Hammond\u2019s oral history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Hammond,%20James%20Wright,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/caohp/searchterm/Hammond%20biography/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/order/title\">James Wright Hammond Oral History.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
