The lines are long and fluid, facilitated by the size of the metal nib of the dip pen, which could hold enough ink to complete a long line without going dry. Although the paper bears a very subtle texture, it is essentially smooth and allowed for fluent, unbroken strokes as Matisse moved his pen over the surface.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri Matisse 41 (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 48.1).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. The ink is glossy, indicating the presence of a resinous binder. The gloss is accentuated when viewed at an angle.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper. There is a watermark located in the top half of the left edge: ARCHES ECO [ ] (1.1 \u00d7 1.0 cm; possibly ECOLE or ECOLIER) (fig. 48.2).\n\nThe interior of the sheet has darkened and yellowed slightly to a cream color, likely due to light exposure. The original ivory paper color is indicated by the lighter band along the sheet\u2019s perimeter that was protected from light by a window mat. The fiber content appears uniform with infrequent blue fibers visible at magnification 8\u00d7. The recto has a very subtle screen texture. The left edge was trimmed after Matisse drew the woman; there is no ink extending over and onto the left edge at the point where the line for the sitter\u2019s proper right shoulder reaches the edge of the sheet. The top edge is also straight cut, indicating it too may have been trimmed. The right and lower edges are hand torn, suggesting those edges are unchanged. It is unclear who trimmed the sheet. It is unknown how much was trimmed but likely not very much considering how closely to the right and lower edges Matisse framed this design.\n\n29.3 \u00d7 22.2 cm (11 1/2 \u00d7 8 3/4 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent minor conservation treatment in 2015. Lifting surface fibers in the lower right corner of the verso (fig. 48.3) were laid down with wheat starch paste. Yellow tape adhesive residue was reduced from the top edge on the verso. At some point prior a tear near the upper left corner was repaired on the verso.\n\nThe interior of the sheet has darkened and yellowed slightly due to light exposure. A 0.5 cm band along the perimeter remains lighter in [glossary:hue], indicating the original paper color. There is a 2 cm curving tear near the upper left corner, in the region of the watermark, repaired on the verso with Japanese paper. On the verso, there are faint remnants of yellow tape adhesive residue along the top edge. There are minor handling dents at the upper and lower left corners.  \nKritsti Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Unidentified owner, Paris, by July 1961.\n\nSold to Paul J.
