The moon is an attribute of the ancient goddess Diana (Artemis in Greek mythology) of Ephesus, who here joins the assembly of mythical and monstrous figures at far right. Rendered partially over preexisting drawing, she extends into sheet 5C. Other mythological references include the Chimera and a sphinx. On the far left, extending from sheet 5A, is a winged, serpentlike figure that resembles a harpy or, possibly, the Persian mythical creature Simorg-Anka (described by Gustave Flaubert in his Temptation of Saint Anthony). Near this figure is a dragon\u2019s head with large, bulging eyes, reminiscent of the grotesque dragon figure in the lower left of Ensor\u2019s 1886 drawing The Devils Dzitts and Hihahox, Commanded by Crazon Riding a Furious Cat, Lead Christ into Hell (fig. 1). Perhaps this creature\u2014as well as the nude with a monster head next to the dragon\u2014belonged to a sketch for the 1886 drawing that Ensor later reworked for The Temptation. Historical restorations are preserved along the bottom edge, and a small, lighter, circular area, formerly patched by the artist, is visible at center right. On the back of this sheet is a study in graphite for Adam and Eve Expelled from Paradise (1887; Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp).\n\nIn this sheet Ensor also referenced depictions by his contemporaries F\u00e9licien Rops (see fig. 2), a fellow member of Les XX (Les Vingt, 1883\u201393), and by the French artists Odilon Redon (see fig. 3, fig. 4, and fig. 5) and Gustave Moreau (see fig. 6). These artists\u2019 imagery merged in the later nineteenth century with scientific explorations of evolution and biology, illustrations for phantasmagoria, and displays of the deformed (see folios 7C/D and 7G/H). The head of one figure is replaced by an animal skull that resembles a fossil or dragon\u2019s head (see sheet 6A). This hybridization of animal and human form alludes to current debates over Charles Darwin\u2019s theories and was often used by caricaturists, especially J. J. Grandville, to parody the bourgeoisie (see fig. 7 and fig. 8). SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 James Ensor (Belgian, 1860\u20131949).
