    "short_description": "The origins of ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arranging, may stem from the ritual offerings of flowers to the Buddha, a practice introduced from China. During the Edo period (1615\u20131868), the peak time for commercial printing in Japan, interest in the scientific field of botany as well as ikebana resulted in a plethora of prints depicting flowering plants. Although ikebana gained its first following as the pastime of nobles, soon all levels of society were drawn to the the way in which this art form both exalted and tamed nature.",
