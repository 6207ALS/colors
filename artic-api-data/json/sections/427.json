Pissarro / 1881 (upper right, in white paint with some red)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Potter Palmer Collection, 1922.433\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">After a rather long hiatus from figurative work, Pissarro began to make paintings of family members and local rural workers again in 1872 but stopped the practice after five years. It was not until 1879 that he resumed this practice, and it is fair to say that during the ensuing two years, for the first and last time in his career, his canvases were dominated not by landscapes but by people. These works were first shown at the fifth Impressionist exhibition in 1880, represented by a single large picture and two smaller works: Woman Scraping a Pot (1879 [PDRS 590]), Father Melon Sawing Wood (1879 [PDRS 610]), and Young Girl Carding Wool (1880 [PDRS 628]).\n\nPissarro\u2019s renewed interest was in full force by the seventh Impressionist exhibition of 1882, which featured at least sixteen of his figure paintings, including the present work, which was listed as number 111 in the manuscript for the catalogue under what remains its title: Jeune paysanne prenant son caf\u00e9 (Young Peasant Having Her Coffee). Pissarro\u2019s figural paintings were prominent enough in the context of the exhibition that four of them were caricatured by the satirical magazine Le Charivari in an article titled \u201cUne visite aux impressionnistes\u201d (A Visit with the Impressionists), along with seventeen other works by him, Gustave Caillebotte, Claude Monet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir (see fig. 10.1, fig. 10.2, fig. 10.3, fig. 10.4 [PDRS 640], and fig. 10.5). Here, the work is given the punning title Le caf\u00e9 au laid (laid, which means \u201cugly\u201d, sounds like the French word for milk, lait). The size of the girl\u2019s cup (see fig. 10.6) makes it clear she is drinking caf\u00e9 au lait, as this beverage is typically served in large round mugs.\n\nThe painting had already sold to Paul Durand-Ruel, Pissarro\u2019s dealer, before the exhibition, on December 19, 1881, which indicates he must have completed it by that date. In fact, all the paintings by Pissarro in the 1882 exhibition were already owned by Durand-Ruel, who had purchased most of them in 1881. Young Peasant Having Her Coffee was among the most critically well received of the group. It was specifically mentioned in many reviews of the 1882 exhibition, and several other critics\u2014including some of the most prominent\u2014did not mention it by name but did discuss Pissarro\u2019s figure paintings with real enthusiasm.\n\nThe general comments about the artist\u2019s figurative work are worth exploring because they reveal a fundamentally sympathetic reaction to these experimental pictures\u2014and also some stubborn patterns of comparison, particularly with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet\u2019s work, that likely disturbed the artist. For example, in his review in La revue politique et litt\u00e9raire, Charles Bigot remarked, \u201cHere is Pissarro, who never tires of being a landscapist but has undertaken the feat of competing with Millet\u2019s peasants. There is no doubt that his peasants recall Millet\u2019s but what good will this do for him, when this memento will only manage to erase his own?\u201d The opinion of other reviewers of the seventh Impressionist exhibition was split down the middle. They either recognized Pissarro\u2019s innovative and fresh depiction of rural peasants\u2014and thus his ultimate departure from Millet\u2019s style\u2014or refused to acknowledge the Impressionist\u2019s skill without referencing his predecessor.\n\nSome critics, however, avoided comparisons to Millet and chose to discuss Pissarro\u2019s unusual technique instead. In Le fran\u00e7ais C. Andr\u00e9 noted, \u201cI will say the same about Pissaro [sic], who, along with Vignon, has the most qualities among these artists, but whose complex execution ruins those very same qualities. Mr. Pissaro [sic] has invented what I would call relief painting. His works resemble topographical maps, with peaks and valleys. At the same time, however, his rural scenes have a certain naive charm, and if the painter just abandoned his manner of execution, he would immediately be given the credit he deserves.\u201d Andr\u00e9\u2019s comments recognize the artist\u2019s desire to make his figures breathe with life not by manipulating the subject but through his handling of color: a formal concern shared by most, if not all, of the Impressionists.\n\nIn Le pays Paul de Charry focused on Pissarro\u2019s portrayals of peasants, partly echoing Andr\u00e9\u2019s ideas: \u201cAn artist with real talent as a draughtsman is Mr. Pisaro [sic]. The poses of his figures are truly natural and alive; one gets a real sense of movement and life breathing through his market women, dressed in vibrant colors and blending in nicely with the dusty, sun-filtered glow.\u201d By contrast, \u00c9mile Hennequin, in La revue litt\u00e9raire et artistique, identifed what he perceived as shortcomings in Pissarro\u2019s paintings related to color, but also recognized the rawness and strength of the artist\u2019s peasants, particularly in Young Peasant Having Her Coffee, stating, \u201cHowever, the composure of his peasants, their poses, and manner of sitting and bending as well as their overall behavior are captured and communicated with accuracy and a striking degree of authenticity.\u201d\n\nAlthough the critics\u2019 sentiments were mixed, the favorable reviews were indeed generally positive and encouraging. Joris-Karl Huysmans, writing in L\u2019art moderne, was captivated by Pissarro\u2019s depiction of the French countryside, openly rejecting his previous opinion of the artist\u2019s works and proclaiming the artist\u2019s departure from Millet. He effused,\n\nOn top of Mr. Pissarro\u2019s landscapes of the Seine-et-Oise, he exhibited a whole series of peasants, and, once again, this painter shows us another side of himself and his talent! If I\u2019m not mistaken, I once stated that Pissarro\u2019s human figures possessed a certain biblical aura: this is no longer the case. Mr. Pissarro has completely freed himself of Millet\u2019s influence;\u2014He paints his peasants without any false sense of grandeur and has instead portrayed them simply, just as he saw them. All of the works in this series\u2014from the little girls in red stockings, to his older lady wearing a headscarf, his shepherdesses and washerwomen, and even his female peasant having her breakfast or gathering grass\u2014are true masterpieces.\n\nIn sum, characterization of Pissarro\u2019s work in 1882 described it as a combination of Millet and Impressionist innovation. Henry Robert in La petite presse focused on Pissarro\u2019s brilliant use of color and authentic depiction of country life, whereas Armand Sallanches in Le journal des arts also discussed Pissarro\u2019s innovative use of color as marking a clear departure from Millet: \u201cMr. Pissarro\u2019s paintings greatly resemble pastels. This artist has a preference for some of J.-F. Millet\u2019s own subjects, but has steered clear of his use of color . . . . There is something simply stunning in his Young Peasant Having Her Coffee and his landscape Sun Setting Over Pontoise.\u201d\n\nOther critics saw parallels between Pissarro\u2019s echoing of Millet and the Impressionists\u2019 embrace of their predecessors, for example citing Jean-Babtiste-Camille Corot\u2019s influence on Monet. As Armand Silvestre wrote in La vie moderne,\n\nIf the influence of Corot can be seen in the work of Monet, then the same can be said about Millet with regard to Pissaro [sic]. But this should not be taken as criteria for criticism. In whatever one does, there always exists lineage in terms of influence, and not so much a familial bond per se, but a spiritual bond, actually more in line with a distant relationship. This reminder of great artists should be considered a triumph in itself. I especially like the large figure paintings by Pissaro [sic] imbued with a certain rustic charm, altogether more lifelike than [Jules] Bastien-Lepage\u2019s female peasants. I will mention here the works which are most worthy of praise, and they include: the Washerwoman, the Young Peasant Having Her Coffee, the Young Peasant Girl in a Hat, and the two large studies bearing the numbers 103 and 104. In all of these figure paintings the same sincere expression, genuine character, and humble work ethic are present. Mr. Pissaro [sic] is also a poet, not a Virgil like Corot, but profoundly deeper and more compassionate to the sufferings of those less fortunate, teeming with the same emotion that inspired Pierre Dupont to pen his painfully moving odes to rural workers, unfortunately not well known to most. Pissaro\u2019s [sic] execution is sobering, powerful, and full of intrigue.\n\nThis extensive press coverage\u2014less than that garnered by Caillebotte, Monet, and Renoir, but more than that earned by most of the other artists present at the 1882 Impressionist exhibition\u2014must have heartened Pissarro in its tone and quantity, if not for its insistent reference to his debt to Millet. Pissarro was supremely conscious of being Millet\u2019s successor as a painter of rural life, and he had spent a good deal of time in the mid-1870s wrestling with his great precursor\u2019s example. Yet, try as he might not to borrow figures, subjects, and poses from Millet, he could not escape being interpreted in relation to his predecessor. Indeed, of all the critics cited above, only Armand Silvestre seems to have understood the fundamental differences between the work of the two artists, which lies primarily in the character and emotion of Pissarro\u2019s figure paintings (although it must be noted that Huysmans, too, eventually concluded that Pissarro had distanced himself from Millet\u2019s influence).\n\nThe younger artist was so exasperated by these almost automatic links of his work with Millet\u2019s that he wrote a strong rebuttal in a letter addressed to Th\u00e9odore Duret, dated March 12, 1882, during the seventh Impressionist exhibition. In it he refers to an essay by Philippe Burty. \u201cAn article by Burty was brought to my attention, one which will have a huge influence [on the way I am perceived]. He complimented me, of course\u2014no doubt out of respect\u2014since he was at the exhibition with [Edgar] Degas. As for the rest, all they do is compare me with Millet, but Millet was biblical! They probably make the comparison because they are particularly fond of all those artists certified as the authorities in art. Isn\u2019t it ironic that for a Jew, one finds barely any biblical reference in my work!\u201d\n\nAlthough Armand Silvestre accurately understood the creative aspects of the filial connection between Pissarro and Millet, he linked the younger painter\u2019s work with that of his nemesis as a painter of rural life, the talented academic painter Jules Bastien-Lepage. It was perhaps this passage that led Pissarro to think more actively about Bastien-Lepage, because the only references to him\u2014both negative\u2014in Pissarro\u2019s letters are made after the 1882 exhibition. Pissarro\u2019s figure painting was read by most critics as occupying an ambivalent position given its apparent modernity of style and the utterly traditional character of its rural imagery. Negotiating this ambivalence was to be Pissarro\u2019s fate for the remainder of his life. Above all, what critics failed to understand was the anarchist political nature of his rural imagery, which was, to him, as \u201cmodern\u201d as the fashionable bourgeoisie painted by Caillebotte and Renoir.\n\nIt would be hard, however, for critics to recognize this modern anarchist undertone in Pissarro\u2019s work, precisely because he did not openly discuss it with his Impressionist peers. He spoke openly and truthfully with sympathizers such as Octave Mirbeau, his son Lucien, and those also friendly to anarchist philosophy and Marxism. The only overtly political art that Pissarro created was Social Depravities, his unpublished and privately distributed album dated December 1889.\n\nThe critics not only misunderstood the meaning of Pissarro\u2019s imagery, but they also sometimes failed to grasp the import of his style, linking it both to the practice of pastel (a connection Pissarro would have endorsed) and to what Andr\u00e9 called \u201crelief painting.\u201d Andr\u00e9\u2019s comparison of the surfaces of the artist\u2019s works to a geographical relief map\u2014although probably made as a criticism\u2014was in fact accurate and important. Complaints about their surfaces had been made since the first Impressionist exhibition, but they reached their apogee in the 1882 exhibition, when his agitated, rough, textured facture was noted by critics both friendly and unfriendly to his project.\n\nWhen reviewing the artist\u2019s first solo show in May 1883 at the Durand-Ruel gallery in the Journal des artistes, Paul Labarri\u00e8re also noted Pissarro\u2019s rough texture and unique facture, but his remarks were much harsher than Andr\u00e9\u2019s. Nearly all critics failed to recognize that the texture was a technique that Pissarro had developed by 1877 to introduce a wide spectrum of hues into relatively small areas of his canvases. This is most visible when looking at passages of the painting in detail (fig. 10.7), especially with the aid of a microscope (fig. 10.8). Indeed, what appears gray is, upon closer inspection, anything but, suggesting that most commentators were unable to\u2014or did not bother to\u2014thoroughly examine Pissarro\u2019s pictures. Close examination reveals ruts and furrows as deep as any in the earth he painted.\n\nThe Art Institute also owns a full-scale drawing for the figure and is thus the only museum with both a large-scale preparatory drawing (see cat. 9) and the corresponding painting, which allows for side-by-side study (fig. 10.9 and fig. 10.10). Recent technical analysis has resulted in many new discoveries from which a few conclusions may be drawn. First, there is no evidence that Pissarro attempted to transfer the drawing to the canvas by squaring, pricking, or wetting the sheet (see Technical Summary in the technical report). Rather, it seems that he practiced drawing the model before moving on to the painting, getting the general outlines of the figure, the mug, the silver spoon, and the various aspects of the room in which she posed. He may have even used the drawing as a replacement for the model while creating the painting, when he had trouble either convincing her to pose again or raising the money to pay her to do so.\n\nYet the two works differ sufficiently for us to conclude that the drawing was made at an early stage and that Pissarro departed from it extensively\u2014in the proportions of the figure, in the character of the room in which she sits, in the position of her hands, in the tilt of her head, in the perspective foote of her coffee cup, and in other details, such as the folds of her attire. In the drawing she appears stiff and awkward, and Pissarro seems to have been indecisive regarding her body\u2019s proportions, perhaps altering details from memory. By contrast, in the painting it all comes off as natural, as if the viewer is in the same room, sharing a cup of morning coffee with the woman. Whereas the drawing represents what seems clearly to be the interior of a room in Pissarro\u2019s own house, with a stand for portfolios shown to the left of the woman, the final painting omits all the particulars of the interior and focuses on the contrast between her and the window on the left side of the composition. In the painting Pissarro does add a chair so that the figure appears supported more than she does in the drawing, but it is so generic that all we can conclude about it is that it was made of unpainted wood and is very simple in design.\n\nWe do know that the Pissarro family moved in the summer of 1881, and it is certainly possible that the painting was begun in one house and completed in another. Thus, the model may have posed for more than just the drawing, yet she has never been identified. She is not Madame Pissarro or her niece \u201cNini\u201d Astruc, a frequent model in 1881\u201383. She may be a housemaid, as Pissarro often resorted to using them as models\u2014as, for example, in Woman Mending (1895; cat. 15). It is also possible that the heavier woman who sat for the drawing is not the same model as the one who sat for the painting, indicating that Pissarro likely had to accustom himself to making changes and possibly even relying on his memory when painting his figures.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro began this work on a standard-size, relatively fine weave, commercially primed canvas by first executing a relatively detailed, sweeping sketch in charcoal or black chalk, over which he set the major contours in fluid blue paint with a small, flat brush. He made numerous compositional changes, including major alterations to the placement of the window frame and sill, as well as changes to the figure\u2019s hairstyle, finger placement, and profile; he also made many coloristic adjustments throughout the background. Ridges of paint seen in raking light examination reveal that many of the original compositional choices were at least partially painted before the artist changed them. In areas of pentimenti, Pissarro executed a second contour sketch directly over his initial choices before continuing to work up the composition. This is most apparent in the window frame at left. In many cases, he worked up to the edges of forms, leaving the underdrawing and ground partially exposed. The figure and background appear to have been worked up simultaneously; changes to the walls and floor at left, as well as to the general color palette in the background, appear to have been the final steps in the painting process. The work is currently unvarnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 10.11).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro / 1881 (upper right, in white paint with some red) (fig. 10.12). After Pissarro signed the work, he neatened and blended the edges of the signature into the surrounding area with additional background paint (fig. 10.13).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were equal to its current size (65 \u00d7 54.5 cm) according to pretreatment measurements. This closely corresponds to a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size (65 \u00d7 54 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 30.0V (0.7) \u00d7 28.2H (1.3) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas has light cusping on three sides corresponding to original tack placement and strong primary cusping along the right side, seen in the warp-angle map (fig. 10.14), from commercial preparation. Close examination of the right tacking margin reveals a margin of unprimed canvas; this may be the margin of unprimed canvas along the edge of a larger section in commercial preparation (fig. 10.15).\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting was lined and restretched in 1962.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray and on the tacking margins, the original tacks were placed approximately 4.5\u20139 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.4 cm.\n\nPrevious stretcher: The pre-1962 treatment stretcher was a five-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a horizontal crossbar. It is unclear if this stretcher was original to the painting. Depth: Approximately 1.6 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso (obscured by lining)  \nMethod: ovular stencil  \nContent: COULEURS [VERNIS &amp; TOILES A TABLEAUX] / P: APRIN / PARIS / [48] RUE DE DOUAI [48] (fig. 10.16 and fig. 10.17)\n\nNot determined.\n\nThe ground is a relatively thin, two-layer, commercial preparation, somewhat filling the canvas weave and extending to the edges of the tacking margins. The ground is left visible in small skips in select areas of the composition, particularly the upper portion of the blue background and the figure\u2019s skirt. The evenness of the ground, in addition to the color merchant\u2019s stamp on the verso of the canvas, suggests the support was commercially prepared.\n\nThe ground appears warm white, with dark particles visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 10.18). Visual examination of cross sections reveals the lower layer is beige with yellow, red, and black particles visible, while the upper layer is off-white with black particles visible in the matrix (fig. 10.19).\n\nXRF analysis suggests that the ground is composed of predominantly lead white with calcium compounds, such as calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate, and barium sulfate. Visual examination of cross sections suggests that the iron oxide red and yellow detected by XRF is associated with the lower layer and indicated the presence of black in both the upper and lower layers. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nInfrared, transmitted-infrared, and stereomicroscopic examinations indicate that Pissarro outlined the major elements of the composition in both wet and dry media. He first executed a more thorough sketch in a dry medium that included the major outlines of both the figure and background, as well as the folds in the figure\u2019s clothing and possibly some shading in the skirt. The major contours, apparently not including the smaller folds in the sleeves and the shading, were then reinforced with a painted sketch (fig. 10.20).\n\nStereomicroscopic examination reveals the initial, more thorough drawing was executed in charcoal or black chalk (fig. 10.21). The artist reinforced the major elements in fluid blue paint with a small, flat brush. The blue paint served in part to fix the charcoal, and because the two media mixed on the surface, often they appear as a single medium (fig. 10.22). In some areas, the sides of the brush made firmer contact with the canvas than the center part, creating parallel lines that are in fact the edges of a single stroke (fig. 10.23).\n\nIt is unclear wether Pissarro made many changes between his initial charcoal or chalk sketch and the contour sketch in blue paint, as excess and unfixed charcoal particles were swept up into subsequent paint layers in many areas. Most compositional changes appear to have been at least partially painted before alteration. In many areas the artist appears to have executed a second contour sketch in fluid blue paint directly over previous choices, as in the windowsill and frame (fig. 10.24). For specific compositional changes see Paint Layer.\n\nPissarro executed this work in a number of wet-in-wet campaigns. In some cases it appears that the campaigns were allowed to dry between sessions, as in the window at left. In other areas, such as the darker blue portions of the background, traction cracking indicates that the upper layers were applied while the paint beneath was still soft, suggesting a more rapid pace of work. The artist began painting from a contour sketch, painting up to and only partially obscuring the underdrawing throughout; thus the paint along the edges of forms is generally quite thin, with the dark blue lines still visible under normal viewing conditions or under slight magnification (fig. 10.25). In some areas the exposed ground around the contours creates a kind of halo effect around objects as, for example, in the top of the spoon (fig. 10.26). Where there are compositional changes, Pissarro often returned to sketching in blue paint immediately on top of previously painted areas before continuing. In some areas the artist reinforced the amended underdrawing as a compositional device, as in the window frame at left (fig. 10.27). The work is marked by moderate impasto achieved with soft, relatively small brushes and paint of a paste-like consistency. Dabs, directional strokes, and cross-hatching were all interspersed throughout the work to generate volumetric and textural effects as the artist moved back and forth between the figure and her surroundings (fig. 10.28).\n\nThe position of the window at left is the most substantial compositional change to the work. The X-ray and infrared images indicate that the window originally took up more of the composition, jutting further to the right and down. The transmitted-infrared image confirms that the window initially extended quite low on the wall, was set at a more perpendicular angle to the frame of the painting, and continued further to the right; a faint horizontal ridge of paint corresponding to the original windowsill can be seen just under the bottom of the current sill near the left edge with a slight raking light. Stereomicroscopic examination of the surface in this area shows hints of green foliage and the muted colors of the outdoor ground underneath the current windowsill and upper portion of the wall corresponding to this earlier choice (see fig. 10.29 and fig. 10.30). Looking closely at the right part of the current window frame, greens and other landscape colors are still visible underneath it under normal viewing conditions; a faint vertical line just to the right of the white inner sill visible in infrared appears to indicate the original inner edge of the window (see fig. 10.31).\n\nPissarro made many small changes to the figure; transmitted-infrared reveals that he pulled her left thumb in a bit and adjusted either the lower edge of this hand or the handle of the coffee cup. The X-ray and raking-light images suggest changes to the placement of the fingers on the right hand as well, with the smallest finger originally almost touching the top of the coffee cup and the knuckles extending slightly further into the background. The X-ray also indicates that the profile features were made slightly more pronounced in the final composition. Additional changes were made to the back of the figure\u2019s collar and possibly to the line of her upper back and the contours and placement of her ear. Pissarro appears to have changed the figure\u2019s hairstyle the most. The bun appears much smaller in the X-ray, while the hair below it bells out further away from the neck. In the transmitted infrared image the area below the bun appears more voluminous, as if a lock of hair is hanging down or the back of the hair is more loosely gathered. In the final composition the artist bulked up the bun at the crown of the figure\u2019s head and smoothed the silhouette of the hair between the bun and the nape of the neck with additional darker-blue background paint.\n\nTraction cracking to the left of the figure\u2019s forehead suggests a change in palette rather than a compositional change (fig. 10.32). A closer look at the background reveals that this area of the wall originally featured light gray-blues fading into pale, warm, earthy peach tones; hints of these original colors can be seen not only in the traction cracks but along the top edge of the composition, especially immediately above the figure\u2019s bun. Adding darker blues both in front of and behind the figure served to separate the figure from the wall and open up the space, as well as to camouflage her original hairstyle. The artist also appears to have changed the wall below the windowsill, although the exact nature of these changes is more difficult to discern. Diagonal strokes originating from the lower edge of the original windowsill and moving from the upper left to the lower right are easily visible in raking light and appear to be a mixture of muted pale greens and tans, a warmer version of the lower layers of the background still visible at the upper right (fig. 10.33). Hints of these colors are also seen at the transition from light blue to dark-blue on the wall and at the corner just left of the figure\u2019s right hand. At the bottom of the dark blue section of the wall, strokes parallel to the edge of the skirt in blue once continued to the top of the skirt before the tans and browns indicating the wooden floor were added (fig. 10.34). At the lower left, where the wall meets the floor, vertical strokes of red and darker blue visible along the left edge hint at possible palette or even compositional changes; separate from both the strokes of the floor and the original diagonals of the wall in this area, their original function is unknown (fig. 10.35). These coloristic alterations to the space appear to have comprised the final stages of the painting process.\n\nMostly small, soft-bristle, round and flat brushes with strokes up to 0.5 cm.\n\nXRF analysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, emerald green, vermilion, iron oxide red and/or yellow, a chrome-based pigment such as chrome yellow and/or viridian, and possibly ultramarine blue.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination suggests the presence of red lake throughout the composition. A sample taken from the top of the coffee mug was identified as carmine lake via SERS.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work is currently unvarnished. It has been cleaned and revarnished many times and retains slight residues of natural-resin varnish in the depressions of the paint layer and around areas of impasto. The earliest documented treatment in 1922 included revarnishing after removal of a natural-resin varnish, although it is unclear when that varnish was applied.\n\nThe painting\u2019s condition was first documented in 1921, when it was recommended that it be cleaned and revarnished; this treatment was undertaken the following year. Its condition was next noted in 1953, when it was documented as showing pronounced deterioration, including a puncture above and left of center and severe wear at the corners. At this time, the painting was put on the non-lending list until it could be lined. A pretreatment exam in 1962 recorded a discolored natural resin varnish with minor overpaint, a small tear at the lower-left corner, several flake losses, slack and weak canvas, and stretcher-bar creases. Before lining the work the following year, the varnish and overpaint were removed with solvents and the canvas flattened with repeated humidity treatments. At this point the back of the canvas was also cleaned, and \u201cuneven spots were smoothed out.\u201d The lining process included facing the work with starch paste, followed by wax-resin lining to a new piece of linen and restretching on a redwood ICA spring stretcher. After restretching and removing the facing, the painting was given three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, retouching, and finally L-46). The synthetic varnish was found to be discolored and was removed in 2007; the work was left unvarnished.\n\nThe work is currently wax-lined, planar, and stretched on a redwood ICA spring stretcher. There are filled holes at all four corners, stretcher-bar creases along the bottom and center (from its previous five-member stretcher), and traction cracking through limited portions of the dark-blue background, including the lower wall at left and the areas immediately in front of and behind the figure\u2019s head. The work is unvarnished with residues of discolored natural-resin varnish in the interstices and depressions of the paint layer and wheat starch paste from the lining procedure throughout; retouching appears limited to the edges.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1960/70): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian (Bologna), seventeenth-century, Albani-style, cassetta frame. The frame has water gilding over reddish-orange bole on gesso and retains its original finish. The poplar cassetta is half lapped with applied mitered inner and outer carved poplar moldings. The back of the frame has been planed flat and a mitered basswood back frame has been glued to the verso. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is cove; ogee\u2013cyma recta side; cove with half bellflower ornament; reverse ogee; frieze with plain miters and centers connected by bulinatura in a pattern of guilloche with flower centers; fillet; torus with centered running laurel-leaf ornament and strapped miters; and cove sight edge. An independent fillet liner was added to adapt the frame for this painting. (fig. 10.36)\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933, removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously housed in a French, late-nineteenth-century, Louis XIV Revival, convex frame with deeply recessed cast plaster foliate and fleur-de-lis ornament with acanthus leaves at the miters and an independent fillet and cove liner. Although this particular frame has been lost, similar frames in the collection have water and oil gilding over red-brown bole on gesso and cast plaster. The sides and frieze are burnished, and the ornament is selectively burnished. The molding is mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ovolo with flower-and-dart ornament; scotia side; convex face with foliate and fleur-de-lis ornament, on a crosshatched bed, with acanthus leaves at the miters; fillet; hollow frieze; ogee with leaf-tip ornament; cove sight edge; and an independent fillet and cove liner.

Pissarro qui se lasse de n\u2019\u00eatre qu\u2019un paysagiste et qui entreprend de faire concurrence aux paysans de Millet. Sans doute il nous fait songer \u00e0 ces paysans; mais quel profit en tire-t-il, sinon d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9cras\u00e9 par le souvenir?\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 381; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas.

Pissaro a invent\u00e9 ce qu\u2019on pourrait appeler la peinture en relief. Ses toiles ont l\u2019air de cartes de g\u00e9ographie, avec des montagnes et des vall\u00e9es. Pourtant ses compositions campagnardes ont un grand charme de na\u00efvet\u00e9, et, si l\u2019auteur consentait \u00e0 quitter sa mani\u00e8re de faire, il se trouverait de suite occuper la place qu\u2019il m\u00e9rite.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 383; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas.

Les poses de ses individus sont bien naturelles et vivantes; on sent le mouvement et la vie sous toutes ces femmes de la halle, v\u00eatues de couleurs voyantes, et fondues ensemble dans la large bu\u00e9e poussi\u00e9reuse que projette un rayon de soleil.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 384; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas. De Charry\u2019s review is dated March 14, 1882.\n\n\u201cMais de toutes ces erreurs, la plus singuli\u00e8re est celle de M. Pissarro. \u00c0 force d\u2019avoir \u00e9tudi\u00e9 les blouses et les tabliers gros bleu des campagnards, ce dernier en est venu \u00e0 apercevoir cette nuance atone partout. Ses arbres, ses pr\u00e9s, ses palissades, sa terre, sont peints avec ce m\u00eame reflet dur, qui d\u00e9colore jusqu\u2019aux joues de ses femmes. Par contre, les attitudes de ses paysans et de ses paysannes, leur mani\u00e8re de se courber, de s\u2019asseoir, de se porter, sont saisies et rendues avec une exactitude, une v\u00e9rit\u00e9 frappante.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 393; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas. Hennequin\u2019s review is dated March 11, 1882.\n\n\u201cEn sus de ses paysages de Seine-et-Oise, M. Pissarro exhibe toute une s\u00e9rie de paysans et de paysannes et voil\u00e0 que ce peintre se montre encore \u00e0 nous sous un nouvel aspect! Comme je l\u2019ai d\u00e9j\u00e0 \u00e9crit, je crois, la figure humaine rev\u00eatait souvent, dans son oeuvre, une allure biblique,\u2014maintenant plus;\u2014M. Pissarro s\u2019est enti\u00e8rement d\u00e9gag\u00e9 des souvenirs de Millet; il peint ses campagnards, sans fausse grandeur, simplement, tels qu\u2019il les voit. Ses d\u00e9licieuses fillettes en bas rouges, sa vielle femme en marmotte, ses berg\u00e8res et ses laveuses, ses paysannes d\u00e9jeunant ou fasant de l\u2019herbe, sont de v\u00e9ritables petits chefs-d\u2019oeuvre.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 397; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas. Huysmans\u2019s review of the Impressionist exhibition in 1882 is actually an appendix included at the very end of his 1883 publication L\u2019art moderne (Librarie Plon), pp. 283\u2013301. The marmotte Huysmans mentions is a type of headgear typically worn by peasants or women working in the fields, and commonly referred to as a headscarf. Huysmans\u2019s description must refer to Pissarro\u2019s large portrait La m\u00e8re Larchev\u00eaque (PDRS 640). Several of Pissarro\u2019s peasant women from his figure paintings between 1880 and 1883 are portrayed wearing marmottes, namely PDRS 620, 646, 658, 671, 687, 689, and 690, to name just a few. For other nineteenth-century uses of the term marmotte, see Gustave Flaubert, Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet: Oeuvre posthume (Alphonse Lemerre, 1881), p. 31; and \u00c9mile Zola, Le ventre de Paris (Charpentier, 1873), pp. 137, 219.\n\n\u201cM. Pissaro se distingue de ses confr\u00e8res par des qualit\u00e9s tr\u00e8s personnelles. Nul ne poss\u00e8de mieux que lui le sentiment du calme champ\u00eatre et de la po\u00e9sie des bois. . . . Les Paysannes de M. Pissaro sont des morceaux de peinture ex\u00e9cut\u00e9s avec un conscience absolue. Ce sont l\u00e0 les gens de nos bois et de nos champs. Ils vivent par l\u2019expression, par l\u2019attitude, par la couleur.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 410. Robert\u2019s review is dated March 5, 1882. \u201cLes peintures de M. Pissarro ressemblent \u00e9norm\u00e9ment \u00e0 des pastels. Cet artiste recherche de pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence des sujets \u00e0 la J.-F. Millet, moins la couleur . . . . Il y a quelque chose aussi dans sa \u2018Jeune paysanne prenant son caf\u00e9\u2019, et son paysage, \u2018Soleil couchant \u00e0 Pontoise\u2019 est tout simplement \u00e9tonnant.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 412; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas. Sallanches\u2019s review is dated March 3, 1882. The work called Sun Setting over Pontoise has not been identified; see Berson, The New Painting, vol. 2, p. 208.\n\n\u201cSi l\u2019influence de Corot est manifeste dans l\u2019oeuvre de M. Monet, celle de Millet ne l\u2019est pas moins dans l\u2019oeuvre de M. Pissaro. Et ceci n\u2019est nullement une critique. Quoi qu\u2019on fasse on est toujours le fils de quelqu\u2019un. Et puis, il n\u2019y a pas l\u00e0 paternit\u00e9, mais simplement parent\u00e9 d\u2019\u00e2me, parent\u00e9 lointaine d\u2019ailleurs. C\u2019est une gloire d\u00e9j\u00e0, en somme, que de rappeler de grands mod\u00e8les. J\u2019aime beaucoup les grandes figures de M. Pissaro, impr\u00e9gn\u00e9es qu\u2019elles sont d\u2019un charme rustique bien autrement vrai que celui des paysannes de M. Bastien Lepage. Je citerai avec une admiration absolue, la Laveuse, la Jeune paysanne prenant son caf\u00e9, la Jeune paysanne au chapeau, et les deux grandes \u00e9tudes portant les num\u00e9ros 103 et 104. C\u2019est, dans tous ces portraits, la m\u00eame sinc\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019aspect, la m\u00eame v\u00e9rit\u00e9 d\u2019attitude, la m\u00eame r\u00e9signation ouvri\u00e8re. M. Pissaro lui aussi est un po\u00e8te, non pas virgilien comme Corot, mais sombre, humain aux mis\u00e8res des petits, plein de ce sentiment qui inspira \u00e0 Pierre Dupont un volume d\u2019idylles vraiment trop peu connu. L\u2019ex\u00e9cution de tout cela est sobre, puissante et pleine d\u2019int\u00e9r\u00eat.\u201d Quoted in Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 413; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas. Silvestre\u2019s review is dated March 11, 1882. Pierre Dupont was a French songwriter and poet born into a working-class family and affiliated in his twenties with the writers G\u00e9rard de Nerval, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, and Charles Baudelaire, as well as Charles Gounod, the composer most famous for his \u201dAve Maria.\u201d Together, Dupont and Gounod composed the song \u201dLes Boeufs\u201c, which made Dupont famous. Dupont was a staunch Republican, and in 1846 composed \u201cThe Workers\u2019 Song\u201d. In 1849, he lobbied against President (later Emperor) Napoleon III. On December 2, 1849 Dupont participated in the faubourg Saint-Antoine barricade, which\u2014along with the publication of his compilation The Peasants\u2019 Song in the same year\u2014prompted his seven-year exile as a purported threat to Napoleon III.\n\n\u201cOn me signale un article de Burty d\u2019une glace polaire, il m\u2019a fait des compliments \u00e9tant \u00e0 l\u2019exposition avec Degas, politesse sans doute, du reste quelle peut \u00eatre l\u2019opinion d\u2019un \u00e9crivain qui a tant de tendresse pour les hommes officiels, ils me jettent Millet \u00e0 la t\u00eate, mais Millet \u00e9tait biblique! Pour un h\u00e9breu il me semble l\u2019\u00eatre peu, c\u2019est curieux!\u201d Pissarro to Duret, Pontoise, March 12, 1882, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), p. 158. Pissarro\u2019s letter is referring to Burty\u2019s review dated March 8, 1882. Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s footnote to Pissarro\u2019s letter to Duret on March 12, 1882 suggests that he had likely not yet read Burty\u2019s review penned a few days earlier, and that it only reached him by word of mouth, by someone obviously misinformed or exaggerating the critic\u2019s comments. My thanks to Joachim Pissarro for his help with the translation of this passage.\n\nCamille to Lucien Pissarro, Osny par Pontoise, June 13, 1882, and January 21, 1884, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), pp. 218\u201319, 276. In the 1884 letter Pissarro reminds his son that works by Bastien-Lepage should not be considered art.\n\nFor Andr\u00e9\u2019s review, see Ruth Berson, The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco/University of Washington, Press, 1996), p. 383. Andr\u00e9\u2019s review is dated March 7, 1882.\n\nLabarri\u00e8re\u2019s review is translated in PDRS, vol. 1, p. 180. For details about Pissarro\u2019s solo show in May 1883 and Labarri\u00e8re\u2019s comments of the same year, see (Woman and Child at the Well; (1882; cat. 11).\n\nThere exist several other drawings for large-scale figure paintings from 1880 and 1881, but they have never before been shown with their corresponding paintings, making it impossible to know precisely their role in the artist\u2019s preparatory process.\n\nAlthough identifying the scene seen through the window may locate the original inspiration for this work, Pissarro\u2019s technique of juxtaposing separate color strokes to create an effect from a distance makes this task extremely difficult. It may very well be that the colors Pissarro recorded are the effect of particular light conditions and not literally those of a particular type of tree and its foliage.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper-right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper-left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests the signature is a mixture containing predominantly lead white and/or zinc white with some vermilion and possibly red lake. The presence of lead, zinc, and mercury was confirmed with XRF. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CafeAuLait\\_1922\\_433\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 20, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, microanalysis summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination report, Nov. 5, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and the standard size may be a result of previous treatments including restretching and keying out of the stretcher.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Software.

Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Young Peasant Woman Drinking Her Caf\u00e9 au Lait, Camille Pissarro (PS662/ 1922.433),\u201d Jan. 2013.\n\nStrong cusping along a single side of a canvas generally indicates that it came from the edge of a larger section of canvas (1\u20132 m wide by 5\u201310 m long) that was commercially prepared and later cut down to make smaller canvases. For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

The dimensions of the work do not appear to have changed significantly during this treatment. See Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Nov. 5, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination report, Nov. 5, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDepth of previous stretcher estimated based on old fold lines on the tacking margins, which have been damaged with age and treatment.\n\nThe current transcription combines information from the 1962 transcription and recent imaging. See Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Nov. 5, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. The previous transcription lists the address as \u201c13 Rue de Douai\u201d and omits the line \u201cPARIS\u201d seen in transmitted-infrared. This stamp is also seen on Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2019s Near the Lake (1879/80) and Two Sisters (On the Terrace) (1881), both at the Art Institute of Chicago. See cat. 10 and cat. 11 in Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlthough glue-based sizing layers are common practice in commercial preparation, no such layer was visible in stereomicroscopic examination of the painting. In addition, a thinly applied sizing layer could have been absorbed by the canvas and may not be visible under the current circumstances. Cross-sectional analysis would be needed to confirm the presence of a sizing layer.\n\nVisual analysis of cross sections indicated the ground is a two-layer preparation. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nVisual analysis of cross sections indicates that the ground is a two-layer preparation: a lower, pigmented layer with red, yellow, and black particles visible and an off-white upper layer with black particles. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments (including carbon blacks), if present. Further analysis would be needed to confirm the presence and specific type of black. Visual analysis of cross sections indicated that the ground is a two-layer preparation: a lower, pigmented layer with red, yellow, and black particles visible and an off-white upper layer with black particles.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nA related sketch, also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1879/89; cat.9) provides an interesting compositional comparison to both the visible composition and earlier choices visible in the infrared and X-ray (see fig. 10.10).\n\nSmall holes present in all four corners, visible in the X-ray but now filled and inpainted, may indicate the use of spacers, or taquets bois, between painting campaigns. Possible evidence of these spacers is also seen in Pissarro\u2019s Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat.8), Woman and Child at the Well (1882; cat. 11), The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13), and Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (1894/95; cat. 14). For a discussion of taquets bois, see Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), pp. 92\u201393. Similar pinholes were also found on Pissarro\u2019s The Quays at Rouen (Courtauld, 1883); see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 5.\n\nThe related preparatory sketch of the same year, Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1879/80; see cat. 9), also shows the window lower in the composition. In the sketch, however, more of the window hardware is included and the lower part of the sill is at the same height as the figure\u2019s eyes and nose.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments (including lake pigments and carbon blacks), if present, and has low sensitivity to elements like silicon and sodium (components of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CafeAuLait\\_1922\\_433\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 20, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is possible that this painting contains the lead white and zinc white mixture found in other Pissarro works from the 1870s and 1880s. Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture was found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. Additional Pissarro paintings believed to incorporate this mixture of whites include Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3), The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), and Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12).\n\nWhen analysis is conducted in air, XRF has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (components of ultramarine blue). The absence of cobalt or any other element associated with the blue tone in this area may indicate the use of ultramarine blue, which would not be detected under these conditions. Ultramarine blue was identified in each of the four paintings by Pissarro analyzed with SEM/EDX: The Banks of the Marne in Winter (1866; cat. 2), Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3), The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), and Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8).\n\nSee Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CafeAuLait\\_1922\\_433\\_SERS\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 26, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings.

Some works, such as The Village of \u00c9ragny (1885; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), feature a typed note from Pissarro\u2019s daughter-in-law Esther expressing both Lucien\u2019s and Camille\u2019s general distaste for varnish. On the verso of Landscape at Chaponval (1880; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), the artist wrote, \u201cplease do not varnish this picture / C. Pissarro\u201d. For a discussion of Pissarro\u2019s varnishing practices, see Michael Swicklick, \u201cFrench Painting and the Use of Varnish, 1750\u20131900,\u201d Conservation Research: Studies in the History of Art 41, 2 (1993) pp. 168\u201369.
