    "description": "<p>The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's \"Museums at Home\" series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based presentations and conversations to older adults. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>Enjoy an overview of the special exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/2939/el-greco-ambition-and-defiance\"><em>El Greco: Ambition and Defiance</em></a>. The title aptly describes the personality of the artist Domenikos Theotokopoulos, called El Greco, an ambitious icon painter, who in turn has become an icon of art. Art Institute volunteer lecturer Dave Williams examines the life of El Greco (1541\u20131614) and his work in view of his late Renaissance influences and his well-known capricious character. The results have created a fiery and interesting chapter in art history.</p><p><a href=\"https://aic-web-cms-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/null138cb433-7e1e-407c-b637-ffc94e927008/ElGreco2020-6-10WellConnected1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Please refer to this handout for the presentation</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This presentation is offered as part of the Art Institute's <a href=\"/lifelonglearning\">Arts Insights</a> program.
