In the upper half of the vertical crease from the former binding, a sewing hole is evident. Ensor likely removed the paper from the sketchbook before drawing on it. Here, too, the application of blue chalk emphasizes the textured pattern of the mounting adhesive on the reverse side. Although most of the drawing strokes extend in all directions, along the right edge horizontal marks frame the composition. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Folio 1H/I.
