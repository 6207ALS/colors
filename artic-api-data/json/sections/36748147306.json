He said that nudes seemed to him to be one of the essential forms of art.\u201d Indeed, the nude would come to dominate Renoir\u2019s work for the next three decades and define his late period style. Later in life the artist was candid about his obsession with the theme. As he told his son Jean shortly before he died: \u201cPerhaps I have painted the same three or four pictures all my life. But one thing is certain: ever since my trip to Italy I have been concentrating on the same problems.\u201d\n\nThe pneumatic form of the model in Seated Bather, characteristic of Renoir\u2019s late figure paintings, verges on the surreal. During the artist\u2019s lifetime these late nudes, whose rhythmic contours follow no prescribed canon of beauty, provoked extreme reactions, and it is hard to believe that Renoir remained unaware of the controversy surrounding them. Mary Cassatt, who exhibited with the Impressionists, visited Renoir in Cagnes several times in 1913 and early 1914 and became alarmed by his increasing frailty and apparent isolation. In a letter to the American collector Louisine Havemeyer, Cassatt wrote scathingly: \u201cHe is doing the most awful pictures or rather studies of enormously fat red women with very small heads. Vollard persuades himself that they are fine. J[oseph] Durand-Ruel knows better.\u201d\n\nIf the Durand-Ruel family held any reservations about this work, it did not stop them from actively buying from Renoir. Between 1908 and 1914 they acquired nearly two hundred paintings from the artist (presumably most were recent) for a total of nearly 500,000 francs, a sum that does not include additional purchases made by collectors and other art dealers such as Ambroise Vollard. The deposit of Seated Bather with Durand-Ruel in August 1914, likely not long after it was painted, reflects an unabated demand for Renoir\u2019s latest interpretation of the nude.\n\nThe most passionate aficionados of late Renoir nudes were leading artists of the avant-garde working in Paris. In July 1919 the art dealer Paul Rosenberg wrote Renoir that Pablo Picasso desired to meet with him during a planned visit to Paris the following month, though it is assumed that Renoir\u2019s poor health prevented this rendezvous from taking place. After Picasso made a trip to Italy in 1917, he entered a classical period of his own and was especially attracted to Renoir\u2019s late bathers. Picasso\u2019s Large Bather of 1921 (Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, Paris) openly confesses admiration of the elder artist and seems to emulate Seated Bather in the pose and the model\u2019s voluminous shoulders, arms, and legs. The poet and critic Guillaume Apollinaire wrote glowingly of how Renoir \u201cuses his last days to paint these fabulous, voluptuous nudes which will be admired in years to come.\u201d Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard were among the many visitors the artist welcomed in Cagnes in the later years of his life, and they came to see the work, not to pay homage to an Impressionist pioneer. The ubiquity of the bather theme in the work of these two younger artists owes as much to Renoir\u2019s example as to Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres or Paul C\u00e9zanne.\n\nEndorsement by collectors and these luminaries of Modernism transformed late Renoir paintings in the eyes of critics. His late work came to represent a new beginning for twentieth century art, rather than a final flourishing of nineteenth century naturalism. When Seated Bather appeared in a benefit exhibition organized by Durand-Ruel, New York, in April 1942, the New York Times wrote: \u201cRenoir\u2019s final effort at its very best, the magnificent nude called \u2018Baigneuse Assise,\u2019 dated 1914. This is one of the greatest paintings created in our time.\u201d Not all were convinced, however. A frequent visitor to the Durand-Ruel gallery in New York at the time of the exhibition, Robert Sterling Clark, grandson of the business partner of Isaac Singer, refused to add a late nude to his collection of about thirty Renoirs, most dating to before 1900. When Clark learned in June 1944 that the Art Institute of Chicago was interested in acquiring Seated Bather, he dismissed it as \u201ca great big mushy gelatinous fat woman with a sad face strawberry tint, has no bones only fat.\u201d Indeed, by the time Clark was writing, this response typified attitudes toward the late nudes.\n\nThe model for Seated Bather is probably Madeleine Bruno, a young girl from Cagnes, who began working for Renoir in early 1914 and assisted in his care as he grew more infirm. She appears quite petite and slim in a photograph taken in the garden of Renoir\u2019s home at Les Collettes in April or May 1914 (fig. 25.1). Renoir\u2019s regular model, Gabrielle Renard, had joined the Renoir household a month before the birth of Jean Renoir in September 1894 and had been posing nude for Renoir since 1900. She left in late 1913 after quarrelling with Renoir\u2019s wife, Aline. Madeleine continued to work for Renoir until at least 1916, when she posed as a standing bather of equally large scale (The Bathers, 1916; private collection [Dauberville 4281]). When asked about her role as a Renoir model in the 1970s, Madeleine found it difficult to recognize herself in the curvilinear forms of his figures.\n\nRenoir\u2019s interest in and admiration for the art of Ancient Greece is clearly articulated in the preface he prepared in 1909\u201310 for the reprinting of Cennino Cennini\u2019s Renaissance treatise on painting. As Robert Herbert has pointed out, Renoir\u2019s long draft for the Cennini preface, which was edited for publication in the Catholic journal L\u2019Occident, refers continually to how the power of Greek art is derived from religion: \u201cConscious of their weakness, ancient peoples felt the need to shelter themselves behind divine power.\u201d The year the Cennini treatise was published, the Thurneyssen family of Munich commissioned from Renoir a portrait of their son Alexander as an Arcadian shepherd (fig. 25.2 [Dauberville 4267]), completed the next year in a pose that makes explicit reference to the figure of Dionysus on the east pediment of the Parthenon on the Acropolis in Athens (fig. 25.3).\n\nThe monumental gods of the Parthenon pediment may also be a source for the pose in Seated Bather, painted three years after the Thurneyssen portrait. The figure\u2019s massive scale can be compared with the formidable proportions of the three goddesses (Hestia, Dione, and Aphrodite), who observe the birth of Athena on the east pediment (fig. 25.4). As Kenneth Clark observed of Renoir\u2019s late nudes: \u201cIn the unselfconscious acceptance of their nudity they are perhaps more Greek than any nudes painted since the Renaissance, and come closest to attaining the antique balance between truth and ideal.\u201d Clark reproduces Seated Bather to illustrate his point that in the early part of the twentieth century Renoir developed \u201ca new race of women, massive, ruddy, unseductive but with the weight and unity of great sculpture.\u201d\n\nWhile Renoir liked to think of his art as rooted in nature and not based in art theory of any kind, the exaggerated proportions of these late nudes raise the question of whether they are simply erotic fantasies or reflect a complex artistic goal in tune with the times. In particular, Renoir\u2019s late nudes can be understood in the context of a psychology of style, part of a broader movement toward spirituality and a definition of the beautiful that lay outside accepted academic practice. In his emulation of the solid proportions of ancient Greek sculpture, Renoir sought a path to the mystical source of the southern classical tradition. Just as the artist endeavored in the 1870s to find universal truths in the popular culture of bohemian youth, in these late nudes he pursued a timeless classicism that he imagined to originate with the inhabitants of an earthly paradise at the \u201cprimitive\u201d beginning of the Western tradition. Toward the end of his life Renoir marveled: \u201cWhat admirable beings those Greeks. Their existence was so happy that they imagined that the gods, to find their paradise and to love, descended to the earth. . . . Yes, the earth was the paradise of the gods. There, that is what I wish to paint.\u201d\n\nThe Parisian artist Albert Andr\u00e9 first visited Renoir in the south of France about 1902 and became a devoted promoter of the artist\u2019s work and one of the most observant of his late biographers. His book on Renoir appeared about May 1919, the month he sent a copy to the artist. In it he describes the artist\u2019s working procedures:\n\nHe launches into his canvas, when the subject is simple, by tracing with the brush, generally with reddish brown [Jean Renoir refers to burnt sienna], a few very quick guidelines to see the proportions of the elements that will constitute his painting. \u201cLes volumes . . .\u201d, he says a little sarcastically. Then immediately, in pure colors diluted with spirit, as if he were working in watercolor, he rapidly rubs the canvas and one sees something imprecise and iridescent appear, the tones flowing into each other, something that delights you even before it is clear how the image will appear.\n\nWhat Andr\u00e9 describes is Renoir\u2019s habit of working quickly with a long handled, fine brush soaked in color thinned with spirits, the way one might use a crayon or pencil. Once the artist applied an initial paint layer, he ended his first session at the canvas. After the underpaint had dried a little, according to Andr\u00e9, Renoir returned with more color and applied pure white to the areas he wanted to be luminous. The thin, transparent tones that resulted were the envy of Henri Matisse.\n\nRenoir executed Seated Bather in a manner consistent with Andr\u00e9\u2019s description of his working procedure. The paint is quite translucent overall. The flesh tones were blended while they were still in a liquid state. That resulting surface appears to exhibit endless variation in tone. Renoir explained to the American artist and critic Walter Pach his goal as a colorist in painting flesh tones: \u201cI look at a nude; there are myriads of tiny tints. I must find the ones that will make the flesh on my canvas live and quiver.\u201d Additional white highlights in the flesh tones of Seated Bather were also added at a late stage to increase the luminosity (fig. 25.5). Renoir\u2019s extensive use of thin layers of color throughout the painting is further exemplified in the blending of the background foliage. He dragged thin, liquid yellow and green across existing textured strokes in yellow and white; the thinner paint sank into the depressions (fig. 25.6). Areas of layered impasto are evident in the face and hair and are especially conspicuous in the application of yellow over the reddish-brown hair color (fig. 25.7).\n\nWhile alluding to Greek sculpture with his principal figure in Seated Bather, Renoir placed the painting in a contemporary context by showing the model wearing tiny earrings and with her hair pulled back into a bun, as well as by adding two nudes in the background who appear engaged in typical post-bath activities: drying off with a towel and adjusting one\u2019s hair. The rugged mountainous landscape setting is reminiscent of Provence, the region in the south of France where Renoir lived out his days. The area\u2019s plentiful reminders of a Greco-Roman heritage cannot be underestimated as a potent source for Renoir\u2019s updated vision of antiquity. Although the late style of Renoir is more controlled and classical in its expression of form, Seated Bather demonstrates that, in these last years, he lost nothing of the ingenious blending of color and luminosity that characterizes his earlier Impressionist painting.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began this work by lightly sketching this composition in graphite on a commercially prepared, standard-size, relatively coarse canvas. The artist reinforced the outlines in some areas several times, and the repeated contours of the figures at the right make specific changes to their placements less obvious. The central figure\u2019s face was lightly sketched prior to painting, unlike the rest of the figure, and Renoir shifted the gaze, lifting her right eye and adjusting her mouth in the final painting. There may also be discrete sketched elements between the paint layers functioning almost like shading, as in the center-right figure. The central figure is largely outlined in reddish-brown paint; it is unclear, however, whether this was an initial planning step or executed later in the painting stage. The paint layer is quite translucent overall, making use of paint thinned with additional oil and turpentine to achieve a very liquid state. The artist also appears to have rubbed areas of the painting with a cloth or his hand, both to wipe back areas of change, as in the figure\u2019s left arm, and to blend the transition between figure and ground. The flesh tones of the central figure appear largely blended via wiping, and the sense of individual brushstrokes seen in the face and the two figures at the right is muted by this method. The painting appears to have been worked up as a whole, with no discrete sequence of execution, and it is currently unvarnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 25.8).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. 1914. (lower left, in black or brown paint) (fig. 25.9, fig. 25.10).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe earliest documented dimensions of the painting are inscribed on the verso of an undated Durand-Ruel photograph of the work: 32 \u00d7 26 5/8 in. [81.28 \u00d7 67.63 cm]; it is unclear whether these measurements predate the lining. Measuring from the apparent foldovers on all four sides, the original dimensions appear to be approximately 80 \u00d7 66.5 cm. This probably corresponds to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size (81 \u00d7 65 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 16.8V (0.3) \u00d7 12.0H (0.5) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nCusping is most visible in the X-ray and it present only on the sides, where it is relatively pronounced; it appears to correspond to tack holes along the foldover placed approximately 5\u20137cm apart. Tacks along the edges of the compositional space would not have functioned to attach the work to a stretcher and may indicate the work was removed from its stretcher, or had another secondary support such as a board (fig. 25.11).\n\nCurrent stretching: The work was restretched as part of the 1953 lining, and the perimeter was extended on all sides.\n\nOriginal stretching: Uncertain; may have been tacked to a board or on the face of a stretcher during or immediately after execution.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with horizontal crossbar. Depth: 2.3 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Unknown.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nA single-layer commercial preparation extends to the edges of the tacking margins, is relatively smooth, and ranges approximately 25\u2013160 \u00b5m in thickness. Interestingly, the ground appears very thin across the tops of the canvas threads, in some cases not coating the threads enough to mask the sense of individual fibers within the thread even under additional paint (fig. 25.12). The thinness of the ground in combination with the artist\u2019s rubbing and wiping of the paint layer left thread tops exposed in many areas; these are especially sensitive and prone to additional abrasion.\n\nThe ground appears to be a dull white in stereomicroscopic examination, however cross-sectional analysis revealed no colored pigments to be present (see Materials/composition). Also, the pigment and medium content do not suggest the ground to be a translucent or semi-translucent layer easily affected by treatments such as lining (fig. 25.13). With these facts in mind, it is not entirely clear whether this current appearance is due to the quality or manufacture of the ground materials themselves or possible discoloration from another unknown source. As the painting is currently unvarnished and was recently cleaned, these visual affects cannot be attributed to surface coatings or grime (see Conservation History) (fig. 25.14).\n\nThe ground is predominantly lead white with trace amounts of alumina, silica, calcium carbonate and various complex silicates, some containing iron. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nThere is a very sketchy underdrawing of the figures at right and of the face of the central figure, marked by a lack of fine detail and executed with an unsteady hand. The nature of the drawing suggests broad movement of the artist\u2019s arm, with sweeping contours and repeated movements, especially for the figures on the right (fig. 25.15). Limited drawing of the central figure\u2019s face is more distinct, though these lines also show a lack of fine detail. The lines themselves were lightly applied, and their direction is often affected by the canvas weave; in some places, the graphite only skimmed the thread tops or was thrown in a different direction by the bumpy texture of the weave. There are periodically stray graphite lines that do not appear to correspond to specific forms, such as the diagonal across the central figure\u2019s forehead.\n\nGraphite.\n\nThe roughness and uncertain quality of the sketch make smaller changes less discernable; however, it does appear that Renoir shifted the level of the eyes and modified the placement of the figures at the right (fig. 25.16).\n\nThis painting is executed in a series of layered washes and semi-glazes with limited impasto. It appears that Renoir\u2019s paint was quite fluid, thinned with solvent or a solvent/oil mixture and often rubbed back with a cloth or possibly his hand so that the color sits mostly in the interstices of the canvas with the appearance of a stain. The X-ray shows very little of the visible composition, as the paint is so thin in most areas that only the overall ground and lighter, thicker highlights register. In some areas, the artist layered this rubbing over an existing color. In the background, for example, a thin layer of green was applied and allowed to dry, over which the artist applied thin reds and yellows, wiping them back to reveal the green painted thread tops (fig. 25.17). In other areas, the underlying paint was quite thick and textured when he added a thin veil of contrasting color (fig. 25.18). Renoir also dragged thicker paint of a pastelike consistency across thin underpaint so that only the crests of the weave are coated creating a kind of contrast effect (fig. 25.19). The artist reserved oil-rich glazes for specific sections of the figure\u2019s hair and upper eyelids, combining red lake with black to create deep-crimson shadows (fig. 25.20); a slight saturation and gloss is still present in these shadows despite a lack of varnish.\n\nRenoir\u2019s most prominent use of rubbing or wiping appears in his modeling of the central figure. Comparing her flesh tones to those of the figures at right, the central figure appears smoother, with many tones indistinctly blended and an earthy, reddish-brown outline. The artist applied many colors side by side throughout this figure\u2019s flesh, and wiped or rubbed them in their still-liquid state to create smooth modeling and to blur the figure-ground transition. Some distinct brushwork is still visible in the thicker paint of this figure\u2019s face.\n\nThis fluid technique yielded a painting that appears to have been worked up as a whole, with the transitions between figure and ground very smooth and sometimes rubbed; the sequence of forms is indistinct. Once the general elements were articulated, the artist went back into specific areas to add details. He also wiped back the paint to make subtle compositional changes, such as the outer edge of the figure\u2019s right arm (fig. 25.21). Layers of translucent washes and glazes make up the hair, while a fine brush with thicker paint was employed for final details such as the eyes (fig. 25.22). In some areas, it appears that Renoir sketched additional lines between and above painted layers; the lines along the back of the center-right figure function almost like hatched shading (fig. 25.23). The presence of impasto in some of the lower layers indicates Renoir executed the painting in multiple sessions, allowing the earlier layers to dry between campaigns. While limited impasto is visible beneath the surface, in many areas it was added as a final touch, as in the white highlights in the drapery.\n\nFine, soft-bristle brushes; limited stiff-bristle, flat brushes (strokes up to 1 cm wide); possible cloth for rubbing; graphite.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, red lake, vermilion, bone black, viridian, terre verte, cobalt blue, Naples yellow, yellow ochre, and possibly zinc yellow.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished with no residues of previous varnish layers.\n\nThe painting was damaged while on loan in 1952 and cut from its stretcher; it was subsequently lined in 1953. In 1972 the painting was noted as being abraded and having a heavy, discolored natural resin varnish. The work was cleaned of grime and given a synthetic varnish of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA. In 2004\u201305 the work was cleaned and all varnish layers and retouching was removed. The tear and some additional abrasion were minimally retouched, and after examination of related paintings, the painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe work is in stable condition, planar and aqueously lined and unvarnished. During the lining process, it was attached to the stretcher slightly askew, so that a small amount of compositional paint is bent over the bottom edge at left. There is a series of small holes in the canvas along the foldovers on both sides. Retouching is limited to areas of abrasion and the tear resulting from the 1952 damage. The work has an overall abraded appearance due to age, previous treatments and the artist\u2019s rubbing technique. There are a few localized superficial creases at the lower left and over the figure\u2019s right hand.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed after 1975): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American (APF Master Frame Makers, New York), mid-twentieth-century, Louis VI reproduction, architrave frame with carved rolled-leaf-and-stave ornament and a lozenge-and-bead sight molding. The frame has oil and water gilding over red bole on gesso with induced craquelure. The white gold gilding is burnished selectively on the ornament and fillet. The gilding is heavily rubbed and toned with washes of oil paint and casein or gouache with dark flecking overall. The basswood molding is mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; torus with carved rolled-leaf-and-stave ornament; fillet; and lozenge-and-bead sight molding (fig. 25.24).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975, removed at an unknown date): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, L-shaped narrow frame with a gilded face on a mahogany molding with exposed splines at the miters (fig. 25.25). The frame may have been a design by James L. Speyer.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Placed on deposit by the artist with Durand-Ruel, Paris, Aug. 1914.\n\nSold by the artist jointly to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Ambroise Vollard, Paris, and Durand-Ruel, Paris, Aug. 2, 1917.\n\nAll shares transferred from Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, and Ambroise Vollard, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Oct. 2, 1917.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 23, 1945.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Durand-Ruel, Exhibition of Paintings by Renoir, Feb. 19\u2013Mar. 9, 1918, cat. 16, as Baigneuse assise, 1914.\n\nPossibly New York, Durand-Ruel, Exhibition of Paintings by the Master Impressionists, Oct. 15\u2013Nov. 10, 1934, cat. 27.\n\nMuseum of Modern Art Gallery of Washington (D.C.), C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin, Seurat, Renoir, Van Gogh, Nov. 15\u2013Dec. 5, 1937, cat. 19.\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Renoir: Later Phases, Apr. 16\u2013May 29, 1938, no cat.\n\nWorcester (Mass.)

Contributing to the strong market for Renoir was Dr. Albert C. Barnes of Merion, Pennsylvania, who began buying the artist\u2019s work in 1912. In the spring of 1914 Barnes purchased a number of Renoir nudes in Paris through Durand-Ruel\u2014just some of the many that would eventually make his collection renowned for its representation of late Renoir. Barnes bought two more Renoirs, a landscape and a head study, from Durand-Ruel on August 26, 1914, but it is not known if Seated Bather arrived in time for his consideration or whether the outbreak of World War I played a role in Barnes\u2019s decision.

Oui, la terre \u00e9tait le paradis des dieux.\u2019 Et il ajoutait: \u2018Voil\u00e0 ce que je veux peindre.\u2019\u201d Quoted in Joachim Gasquet, \u201cLe paradis de Renoir,\u201d L\u2019amour de l\u2019art 2, 2 (Feb. 1921), p. 41; author\u2019s translation.\n\n\u201cIl attaque sa toile, lorsque le sujet en est simple, en tra\u00e7ant au pinceau, g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement avec du brun rouge, quelques indications tr\u00e8s sommaires pour voir les proportions des \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui constitueront son tableau. \u2018Les volumes . . .\u2019, dit-il avec un petit air narquois. Puis tout de suite, avec les tons purs d\u00e9lay\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019essence, comme s\u2019il proc\u00e9dait \u00e0 l\u2019aquarelle, il frotte rapidement la toile et on voit appara\u00eetre quelque chose d\u2019impr\u00e9cis, d\u2019iris\u00e9, les tons coulant les uns dans les autres, quelque chose qui vous ravit avant m\u00eame qu\u2019on ait compris le sens de l\u2019image.\u201d Albert Andr\u00e9, Renoir (Besson, 1919), p. 29; author\u2019s translation.\n\n\u2018The painter who best used slightly thinned paint and glazes is Renoir. . . he painted with liquid: oil and turpentine, quite fresh and not syrupy.\u2019 Henri Matisse to Alexander Romm, Oct. 1934, as cited in Jack D. Flam, ed., Matisse on Art, rev. ed (University of California Press, 1995), p. 188. Quoted in Nicholas Watkins, Matisse (Phaidon, 1992), p. 54.\n\nWalter Pach, \u201cPierre Auguste Renoir,\u201d Scribner\u2019s Magazine 51, 5 (May 1912), pp. 606\u201312, as quoted in John Rewald, The History of Impressionism, 4th, rev. ed. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1987), p. 582.\n\nLate in his life, the artist was afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis and had to tie brushes and other instruments to his hands in order to work. The underdrawing shows much evidence of Renoir\u2019s weakened state in its light touch, easily thrown off by the bumpy canvas texture, and repeated movements, as in the figures at right.\n\nAfter cleaning in 2004, the painting was compared with Renoir\u2019s Woman Tying Her Shoe (1918; Courtauld Gallery, London), which remains unlined and unvarnished and was noted to have an even, velvety appearance. Upon comparison, it was decided the Art Institute work should also remain unvarnished. See Frank Zuccari, examination report and treatment proposal, Aug. 17, 2004; Zuccari, treatment report, July 26, 2005, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. For a discussion of Renoir\u2019s known varnishing practices, see Michael Swicklick, \u201cFrench Painting and the Use of Varnish, 1750\u20131900,\u201d Conservation Research, Studies in the History of Art 41 (1993), pp. 167\u201368.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1945\\_27\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 12, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe verso inscription on the undated photograph reads: \u201cNo. 4107 / a1636 Renoir Baigneuse assise 1914 N.Y. 4107 / 32 \u00d7 26 5/8 inches.\u201d The precise date of this photograph is unknown, as is the date of the inscription. The image is on file in the Department of Medieval to Modern European Painting and Sculpture, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, in addition to restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out of the canvas over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Seated Nude, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1914 (Nude/1945.27),\u201d Mar. 2012.\n\nIn most cases, the cusping may have been affected by tack placement along the tacking margin in a similar location (almost parallel to the set of holes along the foldover); however, as the tacks are from the post-lining restretching, it is unclear whether these holes in the tacking margin are original (see Conservation History).\n\nThere are periodic tack holes around the perimeter along the foldover edge that do not correspond to stretching the canvas on a stretcher. Jean Renoir recalled that late in his life, Renoir \u201cwould buy large rolls of canvas, generally a yard in width, cut out a piece with tailor\u2019s scissors, and fasten it to a board with thumbtacks.\u201d The canvas for A Woman at Her Toilet (1919; Courtauld Gallery, London) was also noted by Burnstock et al. to have pinholes in the corners and to be attached to the stretcher via nails through the front of the picture along the right side. Additionally, period photographs of the artist in his studio show a variety of drawings and paintings tacked to boards during execution and hanging on the walls unstretched; holes along the foldover suggest the work may have been removed from its stretcher and executed or displayed as such. See Jean Renoir, Renoir: My Father (Little, Brown, 2001), p. 363; Aviva Burnstock, Klaas Jan van den Berg, and John House, \u201cPainting Techniques of Pierre-Auguste Renoir: 1868\u20131919,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 3 (2005), p. 50; Roger Benjamin and Claudia Einecke, Renoir in the 20th Century, exh. cat. (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2010) p. 393, cat. 154, and p. 403, cat. 180.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1945\\_27\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Mar. 12, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPresence of lead confirmed with XRF, SEM/EDX and PLM. Zinc was detected with XRF at a very small intensity and may indicate the presence of a zinc soap such as zinc stearate, added by the manufacturer as a dispersing agent. SEM/EDX also detected silica, alumina, calcium carbonate and complex silicates, some containing traces of iron; possible traces of ultramarine blue were also detected in a ground sample from the bottom foldover. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. See also Butler, microscopy notes, June 1972.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nLate in his life, the artist was afflicted with rheumatoid arthritis and tied brushes and other instruments to his hands in order to work. The underdrawing shows much evidence of Renoir\u2019s weakened state in its light touch, easily thrown off by the bumpy canvas texture, and repeated movements, as in the figures at right.\n\nRenoir\u2019s late works were often known for their glaze and glaze-like technique. Speaking of Renoir\u2019s late technique, Henri Matisse said, \u201cThe painter who best used slightly thinned paint and glazes is Renoir . . . he painted with liquid: oil and turpentine, quite fresh and not syrupy.\u201d Quoted in Nicholas Watkins, Matisse (Phaidon, 1984), p. 54.\n\nSimilar rubbing is also visible in Renoir\u2019s Nude from the Back (1917; Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia). For discussion of Renoir\u2019s rubbing technique, see Martha Lucy, \u201cCatalogue 62: Nude from the Back (Nu de dos) 1917,\u201d Renoir in the Barnes Foundation (Yale University Press/Barnes Foundation, 2012), p. 203.\n\nPigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, yellow ochre, Naples yellow, vermilion, cobalt blue (XRF, SEM/EDX, PLM); zinc white (XRF, SEM/EDX); viridian (XRF, PLM); bone black (XRF, identified as unspecified black in PLM); red lake (PLM); terre verte (SEM/EDX); possibly zinc yellow (XRF). PLM results were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. See also Butler, microscopy notes, June 1972.
