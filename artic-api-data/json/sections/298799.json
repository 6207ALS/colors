The scene was drawn either in Paimpol or Vitr\u00e9; both Whistler and Rosalind Birnie Philip identified the locale as Paimpol, a town north of Vitr\u00e9 on the Breton coast.\n\nHowever, when T. R. Way catalogued the lithograph (1896, 1905) he included \u201cVitr\u00e9\u201d in the title. The lithograph shares the same high vantage point with Vitr\u00e9: The Canal (cat. 63), and it may be for this reason that Way believed both to be Vitr\u00e9 subjects.\n\nThe drawing for The Marketplace, Vitr\u00e9 was one of five subjects on fine-grained transfer paper (cat. 61, cat. 62, cat. 63, cat. 64, and cat. 65) that Whistler mailed to London upon his return to Paris from Brittany in September 1893. There the drawings were transferred to stone and proved by the Way firm, probably no later than September 19 (see cat. 61). The Ways served as Whistler\u2019s intermediaries the following year, in July 1894, when editor Gleeson White wished to select a lithograph for publication in The Studio. White was shown a number of recent lithographs and apparently this image was one that he considered seriously. Whistler wrote to T. R. Way on 27 July 1894: \u201cWhich drawing is Mr. Gleeson White finally to have\u2014\u2018The Market-Place\u2019? I daresay that would do if he likes it?\u2014or the Picture Gallery\u201d (letter 98). Ultimately The Long Gallery, Louvre (cat. 86) was chosen for the periodical, where it appeared in September 1894.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 208 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (369 \u00d7 243 mm), signed.
