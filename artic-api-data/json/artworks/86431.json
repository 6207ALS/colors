    "description": "<p>Despite the skepticism artists such as Delacroix felt toward the importance of antiquity to modern painting, Daumier\u2019s prints made ancient lives newly relevant as well as superbly humorous. In December 1841 <em>Charivari</em> announced the artist\u2019s new series: \u201cWe have sent Monsieur Daumier to Greece, alone and without any scientific support. He worked day and night to reveal the Greek soul of the past. . . . Daumier brings antiquity back to us.\u201d The three <em>Historie Ancienne (Stories from Antiquity)</em> prints on view in this gallery show that love in Ancient Greece was just as forceful and complicated as in 19th- century life\u2014with images ranging from this enamored, subservient Hercules to a suicidal Sappho.</p>\n",
