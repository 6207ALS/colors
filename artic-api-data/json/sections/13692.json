Kalo created around twenty designs for candlesticks and candelabra, a fairly small number given the shop\u2019s seventy-year-long existence.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1950s, Kalo introduced at least three new designs for lighting in the Scandinavian mode: a short candlestick composed of a circular base supporting a budlike socket with sepals or petals; a two-light candelabrum whose lights are connected by a semicircular silver tube mounted on a circular base; and a three-light candelabrum of which the Art Institute owns a pair. Although tempting to attribute this influence to the Scandinavian training of three of Kalo\u2019s most long-standingemployees, it is perhaps more accurate to ascribe it to the impact of contemporary Scandinavian design on Kalo\u2019s craftsmen. After World War II, Scandinavian decorative arts in general were in vogue in the United States.\n\nKalo\u2019s three-light candelabra, like the two-branch versions described above, dispense with the central support historically typical of candelabra. Each of the three candle sockets appears to rest on a bobeche, or drip pan, supported by two semicircular tubes of silver that connect each light to the lights on either side of it in a triangular fashion. Like many Kalo drawings, a sketch for this design in the Chicago History Museum details the weight of the silver, 28.13 ounces, and the time required to produce each candelabrum, twelve hours. It also prescribes the application of a quarter-inch round wire to reinforce the edge of each bobeche, a technique utilized throughout Kalo\u2019s history for the purpose of reinforcing rims of vessels of many types.\n\nKalo was not the only company to produce candelabra in this vein. The Danish firm Michelson created a six-light rendition; Berg, another Danish company, fashioned similar three-light candelabra, but with the lights connected in a single line rather than in a ring; the American firm Lunt\u2019s candelabra were similar except for the bobeches, which are of rounded triangular form; and Duchin, an American company founded in 1944 and in production into the 1950s, retailed a version lacking bobeches. Clearly, the basic design was very popular, and there were likely other companies executing their own versions as well. Only Kalo\u2019s and Michelson\u2019s are in silver, while Berg\u2019s and Lunt\u2019s variants are silver plated; Duchin fabricated a hybrid with silver candle cups and silver-plated supports. Only Kalo\u2019s design includes its signature hand-hammered marks on the bobeches, marrying mechanical means of fabrication in the arms with the hand-hammered surfaces for which the shop was, and is, known.\n\nThe lack of skilled craftsmen to replace its aging workers was the ostensible reason for Kalo\u2019s closing in 1970. Other companies, both American and Scandinavian, turned to silver plate, silver plate combined with sterling silver, or even stainless steel to create work both aesthetically appealing and financially accessible to the postwar European and American public.  \nBarbara K.
