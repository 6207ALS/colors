    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This lovely pink sandstone carving of a cow suckling a calf was made in central India in the ninth or tenth century. It most likely adorned the outer walls of a Hindu temple and was visible to pilgrims as they circumambulated or walked around the temple in worship.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: There is a particular ritual in which is it always clockwise meaning that you keep your right shoulder to the sacred monument. In most cases one would circumambulate at least once. Some people circumambulate more than once, maybe three times. But circumambulation as a form of veneration is very common in all of the religions that developed in south Asia.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:As they circled the temple, worshipers might have followed stories carved in relief on the structure\u2019s walls. This idyllic scene of a cow tenderly mothering her young calf might represent a moment in one such story though the rest of that narrative is lost.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: The scene is kind of unusual for a temple because temples usually don\u2019t have that many relief panels that show secular scenes. One can speculate what the broader scene around this cow and calf would have been. Sometimes one sees cows as part of the scene around Krishna, the cow herd. And sometimes you see the cow very much in its nurturing aspects but certainly there is something very beautiful and serene about this particular sculpture and that tends to stop people as they walk through the galleries.</p>\n",
