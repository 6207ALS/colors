Tomatsu was initially opposed to American military control. This picture, a photomontage, is one of a series made to suggest the terror caused by bomber flights on a nation that had recently endured nuclear holocaust. As he wrote to accompany the series\u2019s first publication (also in 1969): \u201cB-52s are enormous bomb-machines\u2014they can travel all over the world with a single aerial refueling\u2014that can carry two 24-megaton hydrogen bombs, 10,000 times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb. Okinawans call the B-52s \u2018assassin of the sky\u2019 or \u2018black death machines\u2019 and are afraid of them.</p>\n",
