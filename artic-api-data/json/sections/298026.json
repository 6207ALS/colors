II.3, II.4.\n\nThe Fireplace is one of a number of lithographs in Whistler\u2019s oeuvre depicting individual sitters illuminated by firelight. Here a Breton peasant wearing a straw hat and wooden shoes sits before a large stone fireplace in a timbered room. The lithograph may have been drawn at an old inn where the Whistlers stayed on their trip through Brittany. The locale is identified by the inscription Fireplace, Vitr\u00e9 in Whistler\u2019s hand on an impression in the Mansfield-Whittemore-Crown Collection, Chicago.\n\nWhistler and his wife, Beatrix, traveled in Brittany during July and August 1893 and were back in Paris by the second week of September. They visited Vitr\u00e9, Guingamp, Paimpol, Lannion, and Perros Guirec, and Whistler made transfer drawings for this image and six other lithographs during the course of his working holiday. Five of these (cat. 61, cat. 62, cat. 63, cat. 64, and cat. 65) were mailed back to London for transfer and printing by the Ways; the other two (cat. 66 and cat. 67) were intended as the keystones for color lithographs and were printed that autumn by Belfond in Paris.\n\nUpon returning to Paris, Whistler promptly sent his Brittany drawings to the Ways, writing to T. R. Way on September 12 that he was mailing \u201cthree drawings for your father to put on stone\u201d (letter 42). The firm\u2019s invoices indicate that five drawings were in fact transferred and proved on September 19, and these were almost certainly the five black-and-white images drawn in Brittany (app. II.3 and app. II.4). Not only did the artist miscount the number of drawings he mailed, but he also included this unsigned drawing of a fireplace inadvertently. When he received the first impressions of the Brittany subjects from London, he wrote back to the printers that \u201cthe man seated by the fireplace was only sent by accident\u2014and never meant to exist at all\u2014Clean off the stone at once and destroy or rather send me every proof you have already pulled\u2014and write me a line to say you have done so\u201d (letter 44; see n. 168).\n\nThe Ways apparently followed Whistler\u2019s instructions and promptly erased The Fireplace. In a letter of 3 November 1893, T. R. Way added the following note to his discussion of some other transfer drawings: \u201cIf you dissaprove [sic] of the results they can be taken off the stone as with the old man in the Chimney corner\u201d (letter 52). Although Whistler clearly disliked this image at the outset, there is some evidence to suggest that his opinion may have mellowed somewhat. He did not destroy all the impressions he had of The Fireplace and was apparently willing to sell them, even signing three before parting with them. It is also clear that the Ways neither destroyed nor sent Whistler every impression they had, since T. R. Way gave Charles Lang Freer an impression in 1903, and his father lent one to the 1905 Whistler Memorial Exhibition in London. In his revised catalogue of 1905, T. R. Way recorded twelve impressions of this subject; however, only seven have been located to date. There were no impressions remaining in the artist\u2019s estate when he died.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove proofing paper (319 \u00d7 257 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (322 \u00d7 225 mm), signed.
