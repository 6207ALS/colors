    "description": "<p>Consisting of approximately 15,000 images that document the architecture, landscape and urban planning of sites across the United States\u2014with a particular emphasis on Chicago and its suburbs\u2014and, to a lesser extent, internationally, The Historic Architecture and Landscape Image collection, or HALIC, contains mounted photographic prints, lantern slides (both black and white and hand-colored), and postcards dating from the 1860s to the 1970s. These materials supplement, extend, and support the architectural groupings described above, with particular focus on the work of the first Chicago School, the Prairie School, and Beaux-Arts urban planning activities inspired by Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett. This collection will be added to on a periodic basis. Of particular note is a large body of lantern slides that was gathered by the Chicago Plan Commission, representing the international influences of Chicago\u2019s urban planning ideals during the 1910s and 1920s. HALIC also contains a significant number of pre-Civil War, vernacular, and anonymous buildings, as well as images from many of the expositions and world\u2019s fairs that took place around the turn of the 20th-century, most notably the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition (1893), and the Century of Progress Exhibition (1933\u20131934), both in Chicago.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Historic%20Architecture%20and%20Landscape%20Image%20Collection!lantern%20slide/field/subcol!format/mode/all!all/conn/and!and/order/title%22\">lantern slides</a> represent the work of numerous photographers and slide-makers, including George W.
