    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This round Athenian vase with the shallow bowel is a drinking vessel called a kylix. Curator Karen Manchester describes a kylix as the ancient equivalent of modern stemware.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER:  This was a wine cup. This was what used at dinner parties which were largely events for men called a symposium. We think of a symposium as a gathering of people for educational purposes. And, in fact, it does derive from that in the symposium was an event that took place in the evening in somebody\u2019s home where men gathered to discuss politics, news of the day like cocktail hour. People would come together. They\u2019d drink wine and proceed with dinner and then other kinds of social activities thereafter. This particular one has evidence of repairs that were made in antiquity. It obviously got broken in some way and the owner cherished enough to take it to somebody to have a repair made.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: In the handle on the right, you can see a crack with a two holes drilled on either side.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: And that\u2019s where they would have perhaps either used some kind of bronze staple. They might have put some kind of cording through there and sealed it with pitch.</p>\n",
