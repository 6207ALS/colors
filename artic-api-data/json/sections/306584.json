When he wrote to the printers on November 12, he enclosed a copy of Marty\u2019s prospectus for the fourth album. The artist explained that they were to print an edition of one hundred proofs for L\u2019Estampe originale and \u201cseven over for government deposits,\u201d and he informed them that the publisher would pay them directly for their work (letter 53).\n\nIn mid-November Whistler asked Marty, who was traveling to London, to take five drawings, all executed on fine-grained transfer paper using both crayon and stump (cat. 68, cat. 69, cat. 70, cat. 72, and cat. 73) to the Ways. The artist instructed his printers to send him two proofs from each stone so that he might select the most appropriate subject for inclusion in L\u2019Estampe originale. When proofs of the five lithographs arrived from London, Whistler repeatedly changed his mind about the choice of image, considering first Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73), then The Steps, Luxembourg (cat. 68), and finally deciding on this lithograph, The Draped Figure, Seated. Correspondence regarding the project passed rapidly between London and Paris from the time of the publisher\u2019s trip until T. R. Way posted \u201cM. Marty\u2019s 107 prints\u201d to Whistler on December 5 (letter 53, letter 54, letter 55, letter 56, letter 57, letter 58, letter 59, letter 60, letter 61, letter 62, letter 63, letter 64, letter 65, letter 66, and letter 67).\n\nAt the Ways\u2019 request, Marty sent the printers a supply of Japanese paper of the finest quality, which could not be procured in London. The printing must have commenced almost immediately for the edition to have been pressed, dried, and mailed to Paris by December 5. Whistler specifically instructed the Ways to pull the edition for L\u2019Estampe originale from retransfers to additional stones, as was their usual practice when printing a commercial edition (letter 65). Because of the extensive tonal work done with the stump in this image, however, the printers were unable to manage the retransfer successfully. They decided that pulling an edition of about one hundred would not damage the original stone, but they did not inform Whistler that they had done so until after the impressions were already in the mail to Paris (letter 67). In the same letter, T. R. Way wrote that the stone exhibited no sign of deterioration, that a small imprint with the firm\u2019s name had been added to the edition impressions, and that an additional hundred impressions could be pulled after the imprint was removed without any diminution in quality.\n\nWhen the impressions of The Draped Figure, Seated intended for L\u2019Estampe originale arrived in Paris, Whistler was delighted with every aspect of the printers\u2019 work: he liked the Japanese paper, applauded the delicacy and careful placement of the Way imprint, and approved of the fact that impressions pulled after the imprint was removed would be clearly distinguishable from the published edition (letter 69). After Whistler had carefully signed and numbered each impression in graphite, he instructed the Ways to mount the prints on \u201csimple card . . . just hinged at the top corners\u201d with \u201cmore margin at the bottom than at the top\u201d; in fact, it was Marty who took responsibility for this preparation (letter 58 and letter 59). The few impressions of The Draped Figure, Seated that remain hinged to their original mounts\u2014into which the Charpentier blind stamp designed for L\u2019Estampe originale (\u201cMarketing the Lithographs\u201d, para. 61) was embossed\u2014correspond exactly to this description.\n\nMarty\u2019s serial publication of original prints proved to be a commercial success. According to Andr\u00e9 Mellerio, complete sets of the albums had been sold out and any that could be located fetched a premium price by 1898. Marty\u2019s albums appear to have been issued without a formal index or table of contents. When Georges Vicaire published the third volume of his Manuel de l\u2019amateur de livres du XIX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle, 1801\u20131893 in 1897, he catalogued the contents of the albums and assigned titles to the prints that had none. The title Vicaire assigned Whistler\u2019s lithograph was, rather inappropriately, Danseuse. Two years previously, the lithograph had been identified somewhat more fittingly as La songeuse in the catalogue of the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d exhibition.\n\nNo image shows to better advantage the full range of tonal effects Whistler achieved with the stump than The Draped Figure, Seated. The artist himself clearly felt encouraged by the progress he had made with his latest experiments in this technique. When the first proofs of his five new drawings arrived from London, he wrote of this image: \u201cThe little sitting figure in drapery I am immensely pleased with. . . . Do you see I am getting to use the stump just like a brush\u2014and the work is beginning to have the mystery in execution of a painting\u201d (letter 58). He used the stump particularly effectively to capture the diaphanous texture of the gossamer fabric that clings to the form of the young model, who was probably Carmen Rossi (see also cat. 71, cat. 73, and cat. 74).\n\nImpressions without letters were printed by the Way firm both before and after the edition was pulled for L\u2019Estampe originale. Although T. R. Way listed only fifteen impressions of this lithograph (aside from the published edition), there appear to have been considerably more pulled during Whistler\u2019s lifetime. After one or two trial proofs, the Ways sent twelve impressions to Whistler in early December 1893, another twelve in February 1894, and another twenty were printed for the Fine Art Society at the time of their 1895\u201396 exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs (letter 66, letter 82, and letter 86). Therefore, a conservative estimate of lifetime impressions of The Draped Figure, Seated would be about forty-four.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (361 \u00d7 242 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (368 \u00d7 242 mm), signed.

In December 1893 Thomas Way pulled 107 impressions of this lithograph for Album IV (October-December 1893) of L\u2019Estampe originale. They were printed from the original stone on heavyweight tan laid Japanese vellum (torinoko paper), supplied by Marty, which characteristically has at least one pronounced deckle edge. There are a few impressions on this paper that are signed but unnumbered, and some that are neither signed nor numbered and do not bear legends. These were apparently printed in addition to the 107 for L\u2019Estampe originale.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid Japanese vellum (293 \u00d7 237 mm), signed and numbered No. 93; Palmer, tan laid Japanese vellum (292 \u00d7 235 mm), signed and numbered No. 31; SC, tan laid Japanese vellum (291 \u00d7 240 mm), signed and numbered No. 102.

An impression that is still hinged to Marty\u2019s original mount and is preserved in a complete album is found in Athens, Georgia, Georgia Museum of Art (signed and numbered No. 37).  \nNesta R.
