    "description": "<p>Chicago hoped to surpass the 1889 Paris Exposition's Eiffel Tower with an even more remarkable one.  Many suggestions were put forth, one of which was the plan drawn up by architect Peter Weber in 1892 for the Partello Tower Company.  His proposal, reminiscent of the tower of Pisa, would rise 400 feet high with an electric railway following a spiral course to the top affording excellent views of the city.  A full chime of beautifully toned bells was to be placed in the top of the tower.   In the end no tower was built.  Instead, Chicago\u2019s great engineering contribution to the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition will always be remembered as George Ferris's giant wheel.</p>\n",
