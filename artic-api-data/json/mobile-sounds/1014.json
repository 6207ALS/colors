    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Associate Curator Kate Nesin.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: Damien Hirst works in series, producing a number of similar or related works over the course of years, and \u201cStill\u201d is part of a larger series of medical cabinet sculptures.  It is a sinister work in many ways\u2026 It\u2019s a kind of cabinet of curiosities.  In this case all surgical devices, which I\u2019ve read one critic refer to instead as contemporary torture devices.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Hirst gravitated toward macabre subjects at a young age, including a preoccupation with pathology books. He said \u201cWhat I like is that contradiction: a really gorgeous photograph of something horrific.\u201d</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: The title is something I come back to again and again because in some ways it\u2019s a literal title. They are objects that are stilled, they are not in action.  It\u2019s a still work formally. There\u2019s a great deal of order here.</p>\n<p>But of course the title, Still, also makes me think of the body that is suggested but really pointedly absent here, the still body on an operating table, for example, or perhaps the no longer living body.  There is a really strange sense of narrative here that something is maybe about to happen or has just happened, could happen.  There\u2019s a lot of suspension in this piece.</p>\n<p>There is a great deal of obsessiveness, of compulsion.  And in the orderliness of the arrangements, in the pristineness of all of these surfaces, not just the instruments, but the cabinets and the mirrored backs, and then in the idea that he came back to the subject matter again and again.</p>\n",
