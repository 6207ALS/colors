For this vignette he used the back of the same block on which he carved Mahana atua four years earlier (cat. 80). On the same side, he also carved a second vignette, Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available block was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers onto his prints. The block is extant, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 111.1.2).\n\nThis impression is printed in black ink. The inking is richer in this impression than it is in a second impression in the museum\u2019s collection (cat. 111.2). The two impressions in the Art Institute collection do not include the signature noted in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints. Although the signature was absent from the block when this impression was printed, the artist added it later on. By the time Gauguin used the headpiece in his November 1899 issue of Le sourire (cat. 110), the signature is present.\n\nThe block was printed on a thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper that was irregularly trimmed along the bottom. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block.\n\n100 \u00d7 186 mm (image); 127 \u00d7 228 mm (sheet)\n\nPrior to entering the museum\u2019s collection in 2002 the print was mounted with thin threads adhered at each corner, which pulled and created undulations in the thin, fragile sheet. Additionally, there was a line of discoloration around the image from contact with an acidic mat. In 2002, a strip of Japanese paper (40 \u00d7 228 mm) sympathetic in appearance and weight to the original was added to protect the bottom edge of the print, and the threads were removed.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nKristi Dahm, condition report, treatment record, and photographic documentation, Nov. 2002, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nElizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W.
