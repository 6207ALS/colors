Pennell] No. 2)\n\nWhistler drew four portrait lithographs (cat. 141, cat. 142, cat. 143, and cat. 144) of American artist Joseph Pennell in January 1896. Of these, two were informal seated portraits drawn by firelight (cat. 143 and cat. 144). Pennell and his wife, Elizabeth Pennell, remembered that Whistler drew their portraits during a series of afternoon visits to their lodgings on Buckingham Street. There is little evidence to suggest which of the seated lithographs was drawn first. Whistler\u2019s addition of the designations \u201cNo. 1\u201d and \u201cNo. 2\u201d to the titles of his lithographs generally indicates his preference rather than the order in which the images were created. It may be that the present lithograph, Firelight: Portrait of Joseph Pennell, No. 2, was actually the first study he made for a portrait commission from publisher T. Fisher Unwin, who wanted a frontispiece for the Pennells\u2019 forthcoming volume, Lithography and Lithographers. Whistler first mentioned the portrait commission in a letter of January 20 to Unwin, in which he wrote: \u201cI rather think I shall do another drawing of Pennell\u2014for I know that I can get something to please me better\u2014and then you shall hear all about it.\u201d Given that he ultimately selected the other seated portrait, Firelight: Portrait of Joseph Pennell, No. 1 (cat. 144), as the book\u2019s frontispiece and indicated his preference for it with the \u201cNo. 1,\u201d it seems likely that his first and less preferred version of the subject was the one he designated \u201cNo. 2.\u201d Based on the artist\u2019s letter to Unwin, we may presume that the present image was drawn no later than 20 January 1896.\n\nBoth lithographs depict the slender Joseph Pennell, who was thirty-eight at the time, posed casually in an armchair. In both images his legs are crossed, although in different directions in the two versions. Like the two standing portraits of Pennell (cat. 141 and cat. 142) and the firelight portrait of his wife (cat. 145), the two seated portraits were drawn on the white transfer paper that Whistler obtained from the Ways beginning in November 1895. Although ultimately not selected for the Unwin commission, Firelight: Portrait of Joseph Pennell, No. 2 transferred successfully. It was one of five images that Whistler added to the exhibition at the Fine Art Society in late January, when the show had already been open for over a month (app. V.1).\n\nOn Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s orders, no posthumous edition of this subject was printed.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 229 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 228 mm), signed.
