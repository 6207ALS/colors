    "description": "<p>David Garrick, one of the most influential actors of 18th century Britain, appears here in the guise of the titular character from William Shakespeare\u2019s <em>King Lear</em>, a role he played numerous times on the stage. The play follows Lear\u2019s mental breakdown after he relinquishes his power and divides his kingdom between two of his daughters. In this portrait, made after Garrick\u2019s passing and based on prints created from his death mask, the actor wears a crown of wheat and wildflowers in reference to a famous scene in the play during which the king rages at a storm, daring it to harm him.</p>\n",
