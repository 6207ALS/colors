    "description": "All Cezanne wants is to be a great painter like his friends Monet, Pissarro, and Renoir. But when he shows his works, the professors, the critics, and the collectors all dismiss him: \u201cToo flat!\u201d \u201cToo much paint!\u201d \u201cThese are rough and unfinished!\u201d Even his own pet parrot, Bisou, can\u2019t be brought to say, \u201cCezanne is a great painter!\u201d And who can blame them? Cezanne doesn\u2019t care about tradition, and he doesn\u2019t follow the rules. He\u2019s painting in a way no one else has done before, creating something completely new\u2013and he\u2019s destined to change the world of art forever. Cezanne\u2019s Parrot is a spirited celebration of creativity, determination, and perseverance\u2013and the artist who would become known as the father of modern art.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 x 11 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 40</li><li><strong>4-8 years</strong></li></ul>",
