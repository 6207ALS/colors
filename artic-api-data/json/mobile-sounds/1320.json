    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: If you were designing the perfect scary creature to guard your door, what would it look like?  Over 1,000 years ago, a Chinese sculptor picked out all the scariest bits of different animals and put them together into these two beasts.  They sat inside the door of a tomb to guard against evil spirits or intruders.  How many different animal parts can you find on them?  Look for strong hooves, to stomp with great wings, sharp teeth ready to bite and maybe scariest of all the face of a monstrous being.</p>\n<p>UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  You there, halt or else.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  With these two creatures on patrol, the people inside the tomb could definitely rest in peace.  Did you notice that the colors on these creatures seem to be melting?  It's not a mistake, it's supposed to look that way.  To finish the sculptures, the artists bake them in a hot oven, while they baked, the special colors he had poured on top continued to drip and drizzle, the sculpture never knew exactly what patterns the colors would make until he opened the oven and took a look, no two beasts ever looked the same.</p>\n",
