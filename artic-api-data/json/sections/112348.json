In Ensor\u2019s treatment of the meeting, however, the classical temple described by Gustave Flaubert in his Temptation of Saint Anthony looks more like the Brussels opera house, the Royal Theater of the Mint (Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Royal de la Monnaie, or La Monnaie), which was rebuilt in 1856 in a Neoclassical style after designs by Joseph Poelaert (see fig. 1). A bas-relief by Eug\u00e8ne Simonis, Harmony of Human Passions (1854), fills the pediment of the actual building; here it has been replaced by the letter M, a possible reference to the theater\u2019s name. The gods Zeus, Hera, Heracles, and Hermes (in Roman mythology, Jupiter, Juno, Hercules, and Mercury, respectively) are assembled along the pediment roof. Other features\u2014the grandiose scale and the scene\u2019s juxtaposition with a nearby maritime view\u2014are suggestive of the scenery that Ensor might have seen in the Royal Theater\u2019s performances. For example, he attended a performance of Wagner\u2019s Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyrie) there on March 9, 1887. In the center of the folio, a bare-breasted man holding a spear and shield and wearing a tall, mitered hat topped by a feather bears a resemblance to an African tribal chief or perhaps one of the Babylonian gods mentioned by Flaubert. The staff the figure holds was reworked in the sheet below (4I) in response to a shift in alignment caused by the mounting process (see fig. 2). Beside him are three six-pointed stars, a possible allusion to Freemasonry. The bared buttocks and defecation to the right of the figure add a note of scatological mockery to the otherwise sober scene.\n\nThe folio was drawn in concert with neighboring sheets 4H and 4I before they were mounted to the canvas. Initially they may have been attached to another surface while they were worked out as a group. SMC/KJN\n\nEnsor\u2019s fascination with the visual energy produced by the contrasts of light and dark and the interaction of his figures within pictorial space is reflected in both this sheet and the print Capture of a Strange Town (fig. 3; see also sheets 3F, 3G, 4F, 4G, 4H, and 4I). Indeed, the artist was constantly preoccupied by light and space. Ensor had a strong memory for composition and design; the work of other artists seems to have frequently stuck with him and been integrated into his own oeuvre. Closer consideration of Capture of a Strange Town reveals a probable source for its composition: the mezzotint Belshazzar\u2019s Feast by John Martin, an English Romantic artist and favorite of King Leopold I of Belgium (fig. 4). The explosion of the elements and fantastical landscapes lie at the heart of Martin\u2019s biblical scenes, which exhibit an energy that clearly left its mark on Ensor. The Belgian artist likely saw Martin\u2019s work in Ernest Chesneau\u2019s La peinture anglaise (English Painting; A. Quantin, 1882), as he copied several works from this book.
