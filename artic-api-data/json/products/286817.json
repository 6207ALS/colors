    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">T-shirt developed from Paul Cezanne\u2019s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Three Skulls</em>, 1902-06, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This T-Shirt features an iconic work by Paul C\u00e9zanne. C\u00e9zanne's preoccupation with death was an ongoing theme that can be identified in a number of still life skull paintings that he produced between 1898 and 1906. These paintings, produced in both oils and watercolor, offer a more subtle representation of the traditional theme of vanitas.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp; S, M, L, XL, XXL.</li>\n<li><strong>Material:</strong> 100% Cotton, small flecks are part of the fabric\u2019s natural content.</li>\n</ul>",
