    "short_description": "Soga Shohaku (1730\u20131781) and Nagasawa Rosetsu (1754\u20131799) were two rebels of 18th-century Japanese painting in Kyoto. Both were trained in the classic manner of their respective schools but created a distinctive style that can only be described as independent and daring. Not surprisingly, their art matched their nonconformist personalities. On view will be a pair of screens and several hanging scrolls by these masters of the brush.",
