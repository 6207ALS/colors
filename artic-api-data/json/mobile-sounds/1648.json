    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Look up.  The words running around the walls of this gallery are a work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres.  They recall the kind of architectural decoration often carved on the walls of public buildings, but they're also a form of self-portrait.  Curator James Rondeau</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU:  Gonzalez-Torres is trying to I think say that any life is made up between public and private events.  So you see that, as you look around the room, a number of readily identifiable points in history-- the Great Society, 1964; the Civil Rights Act, also 1964; Berlin Wall, 1989; Black Monday, 1987-- and those are all combined with things that are essentially very private-- Red Canoe, 1987; Julie, 1987, Sloan Kettering, 1995.  Many of those references have to do with illness and disease.  Gonzalez-Torres was an artist living with HIV/AIDS.  He died of the disease in 1996.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Remarkably, Gonzalez-Torres engineered this self-portrait so that it would continue to grow and change beyond his own lifetime.  He stipulated that this piece's owner should add to this sequence of events as they see fit.  This is the first time the museum has done so since acquiring Gonzalez-Torres's self-portrait.  To hear about these additions, press Play.</p>\n",
