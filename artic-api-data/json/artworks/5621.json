The support of the army was critical: the year A.D. 69 saw one general after another claim the throne only to be killed by one of his rivals. Finally, the Roman army in Egypt joined the army in Syria to back General Vespasian. Knowing that Egypt was the empire\u2019s breadbasket, Vespasian\u2019s first effort as emperor was to pacify and control this important province. The armor he wears on this coin emphasizes his role as a warrior king.</p>\n",
