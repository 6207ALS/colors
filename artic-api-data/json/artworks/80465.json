    "description": "<p>Chicago artist John Storrs spent most of his career in France but retained ties to his native city. His <em>Winged Horse</em> was executed in Paris and demonstrates his adoption of French modernist abstraction and geometric simplification. The design\u2019s impetus, however, was American: Storrs conceived the work as a model for a large-scale monument to honor one of his idols, the poet Walt Whitman. The artist wrote that Whitman \u201cstands practically alone as one who has discovered a national soul and has given it expression in a form that can be called beautiful\u2014that can be called art.\u201d Regrettably, Storrs never found financial backing for his project.</p>\n",
