    "description": "<p>Together with those of a riverscape, rocks, flowers, and branches of cedar and bamboo, the magpie is one of six images painted by Yao Shou along the length of this handscroll. Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as \u201cbird-and-flower,\u201d whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou\u2019s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue.</p>\n<p>Yao Shou accompanied the magpie\u2014as he did its companion images\u2014with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou:</p>\n<p><q>In the bright moonlight, why does the<br>magpie circle three times before<br>alighting?<br>During sunny days, it sings on the green<br>branches.<br>I also practice divination to find the place<br>where the magpie often roosts.<br>It stays on the rooftop of the old master\u2019s<br>house, and the stars arrive late.</q></p>\n<p>The title and artist\u2019s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. \u201cPillars of the Country\u201d refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China\u2019s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar\u2009\u2014\u2009 all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past.</p>\n<p>As documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736\u201395), China\u2019s most passionate imperial collector.</p>\n",
