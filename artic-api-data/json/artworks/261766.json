    "description": "<p>This sculpture is part of a collection of small works that offer insight into Claire Zeisler\u2019s experimental and dedicated textile-based practice. Composed of thread, wool, suede, and stones, these works\u2014often made while the artist watched television in bed\u2014exemplify her material and technical investigations. In a 1983 conversation with craft historian Janet Koplos, Zeisler explained: \u201cExperimentation is the most important thing an artist does, and you should continue to experiment as long as you work.\u201d Later in the interview, she expanded upon this notion in describing her small sculptures, \u201cI kind of ad lib in the small pieces, which I never do in the big ones. . . the small pieces are really me.\u201d The handheld scale of the works, in marked contrast to her large, even monumental sculptures, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/56108\"><em>Red Preview</em></a> (1969) and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65209\"><em>Private Affair I</em></a> (1986), reflect their more intimate fabrication process.</p>\n",
