    "description": "<p>British designer Max Lamb is known for a hands-on approach to design that combines both low- and high-tech methods of production and celebrates human capability and its limitations. Not committed to a single process of creation, Lamb exploits the qualities inherent in his materials to draw out their natural tendencies and incite exploration.</p><p>A forthcoming exhibition of Lamb\u2019s work, his first in the United States, will open in spring 2018 as part of the Franke Herro Design Series at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>Co-sponsored by the Department of Architecture, Interior Architecture, and Designed Objects at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Architecture &amp; Design Society</p>",
