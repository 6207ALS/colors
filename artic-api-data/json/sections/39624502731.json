A reassessment of the artist\u2019s own writings as well as careful examination of prints previously thought to lie outside the group have provided convincing evidence that there were instead fifteen prints in the suite\u2014and that this work was among them. Indeed, it was likely the first to be produced on a piece of inferior indigenous wood, the quality of which Gauguin lamented. The wood block used was most certainly not one of Gauguin\u2019s prized blocks of end-grain boxwood, at least three of which he industriously reused in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1896. The coarse block had a pronounced grain and surface texture, as it was cut with the grain of the wood rather than against or across its grain (like his boxwood blocks). The indigenous tropical wood was soft and not conducive to fine incising with a needle or crisp carving with thin, sharp gouges. This wood, unlike boxwood, readily compressed under pressure and selectively broke into splinters when incised with too fine a point.\n\nHere we see an artist struggling with his new medium. Gauguin printed three states in only a handful of impressions on reused scraps of paper. This impression is printed on a fragment of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55) and is one of only three known impressions of the third state. In all of the impressions of At the Black Rocks, the artist was unable to carve lines that can be read clearly to establish depth between the two figures in the foreground and middle ground, with the waves presumably intended to be behind them. Throughout, the printed irregularities in the wood interfere with the legibility of the impressions. This phenomenon is repeated to a lesser degree in the print Interior of a Tahitian Hut (cat. 92). However, in cutting the block for that print, the artist positioned the composition in the most texturally uniform part of the block and retained a border of uncut wood around his composition rather than using the wood\u2019s irregular surface in its entirety. The dimensions of the central vignette in Interior of a Tahitian Hut closely correspond to the overall dimensions of this image (fig. 91.2.2).\n\nThe wood block is printed in black ink that was thickly and unevenly distributed across the block.\n\nThis impression is printed on the back of a fragment of a rejected Roy impression of Maruru from Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite (fig. 91.2.1). The paper is smooth and moderately thick. It was produced in the West to simulate the appearance of Japanese vellum, another moderately thick paper with a lustrous surface prized by printmakers at the time. The sheet was irregularly cut down on all edges.\n\n103 \u00d7 186 mm (image); 106 \u00d7 191 mm (sheet)\n\nIn this, the third and last state of this print, Gauguin removed much of the fine incising that appeared in and around the figures in the first and second states. This is a step he repeated in carving the majority of blocks for the group of late wood-block prints that were printed in multiple states.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. There is a small pinhole, rusted at the edges, along the top edge at center. There are pinpoint spots of residual ocher printing ink to the right of the central figure and in the lower right corner of the sheet from the initial printing of the Roy impression of Maruru. On the verso there are several white accretions. The tips of the four corners are worn.  \nHarriet K.

Made on some wood planks, and with my failing eyesight, these engravings are necessarily produced by a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form).

Translation by Genevieve Westerby.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nThe end-grain boxwood blocks that were reused from the Noa Noa Suite include Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58); the verso of a third, larger block that was used for the large Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cats. 77 and 78); and finally the block for Mahana atua (Day of the God) (cat. 80), constructed with two large screws to secure the boxwood segments together on the verso, was used to carve two images for Le sourire (The Smile).\n\nFor an insightful study of eleven extant woodblocks from late in the artist\u2019s career now in the collection of the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague, see Libuse S\u00fdkorova, Gauguin Woodcuts, trans. Till Gottheiner (P. Hamlyn, 1963). The author\u2019s observations were extremely helpful to this study and he is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nAt this time of transition when money was sparse and materials were precious, numerous impressions of the smaller prints produced in Paris and upon the artist\u2019s return to Tahiti are printed on paper fragments from discarded Noa Noa Suite Roy impressions (see also cats. 83, 84, and 115). Most often, Gauguin reused a group of failed impressions of Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57), in which the black ink bled into and smudged the pale-orange ink in the bonfire.\n\nDouglas W.
