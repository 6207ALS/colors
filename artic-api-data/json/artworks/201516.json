    "description": "<p>Grcic\u2019s interest in planes and lines is here expressed in a series of tableware made for Serafino Zani. His collection Passami il sale, which literally means \u201cPass the salt\u201d in Italian, was engineered utilizing the skills of the local craftspeople living and working to the north of Brescia. It includes a set of salad servers made from lengths of bent wire, a collection of serving trays made from lasercut stainless steel, and a breadbasket perforated with elongated cuts that provide a decorative element. Recently, Grcic also added a set of cutlery, Accento, to the series. Its simple design reflects that used to create the other elements, though the oversized utensils also have a cartoonlike quality that sets them apart. Their unpretentious design makes them suitable for everyday use. Working with the same visual language, Grcic also added a set of salad servers, lasagna and cheese knives, and a risotto spoon to the Accento family of kitchen utensils.</p>\n",
