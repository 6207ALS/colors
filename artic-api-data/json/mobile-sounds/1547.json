    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: &quot;Are They Thinking About the Grape?&quot; asks the title of this charming pastoral scene. The answer clearly is no. Their thoughts are of love and desire. The painting is by French 18th century artist Francoise Boucher, who invented this kind of idyllic rustic love scene. Boucher drew this particular subject from Parisian pantomime or popular theater of the time. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF:  The pantomime deals with the little shepherd and his love, Lisette, and the small obstacles that are put in the way of their love and how they triumph. The shepherd and shepherdess are relaxing in a landscape. They're dressed simply. Their feet are bare. But nevertheless, they're quite elegant, and their sheep and goats are scattered all around them looking very comfy and untroublesome.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Boucher responded astutely to the expanding market for fine and decorative arts in 18th century France, putting his artistic talents to extremely diverse uses.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF:  Boucher was a tremendously prolific and accomplished painter, a painter to the king but also a painter who understood the usefulness of the multiplication of his designs. Here he draws on contemporary pantomime. His designs in turn were reused in the Gobelins tapestry production and in porcelain production and were very much part of contemporary culture.</p>\n",
