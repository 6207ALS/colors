    "description": "<p>When asked to design a book commemorating New York City\u2013based Creative Time\u2019s 33 years of bringing public art to the city, Hjalti Karlsson and Jan Wilker conceived of a cover that was a site-specific public-art project. The team built the Urban Visual Recording Machine (UVRM), which roamed the city in a truck, stopping at sites important to the history of Creative Time. Every 30 seconds, for 5 days in 2006, the UVRM recorded surrounding colors, ambient sound, and current weather conditions. It processed and transcribed this information into a series of \u201cactivity graphs\u201d and instantly printed these onto single sheets of paper on site. The cover of every book bears one of these \u201csnapshots\u201d\u2014a unique artifact documenting the urban landscape and connecting public art with the making of the book.</p>\n",
