Commissioned by Charles II and designed by Christopher Wren in 1682, the complex of buildings was intended from the outset to house war veterans. The lithograph captures two \u201cChelsea pensioners,\u201d as these retired soldiers were called, seated on a bench in the sun, while a small group of neighborhood children play in the foreground. The composition, focused on the old doorway, its surrounding columns, and the courtyards glimpsed in the distance, repeats a motif frequently employed by the artist in the pastels and etchings he made in Venice in 1879/80.\n\nWhistler drew Courtyard, Chelsea Hospital directly on stone rather than on transfer paper. The stone appears to have been coarsely grained, providing a difficult drawing surface; as a result, impressions are rather spotty and lacking in clarity. The stump was used minimally in the darkest vertical shadow of the door. Whistler was probably disappointed with the image, judging from the small number of prints pulled and from the fact that the stone seems to have been erased almost immediately after proofing. In the 1905 edition of his catalogue, T. R. Way reported only six proofs of this subject; however, fourteen impressions (four signed, ten unsigned) were listed in the 1903 inventory of the artist\u2019s estate.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 196 mm), signed; MWC, cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 196 mm).
