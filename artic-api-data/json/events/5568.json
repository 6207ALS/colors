I create baskets to educate, to humor, to engage people in conversation, to get people to think, to learn, to share, to give a voice the traditions of yesterday and combine these teachings with my role in a contemporary world today.\"</p><p>Two of Church\u2019s artworks are currently on view in the museum\u2019s Arts of the Americas galleries: <em>Black Ash Teachings </em>in Gallery 136 and<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Sustaining Traditions\u2014Digital Teachings</em> in Gallery 262. Visitors are invited to engage in an informal question and answer session with the artist.</p><p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p>Kelly Church is an Ottawa/Pottawatomi/Ojibwe black ash basket maker, fiber artist, educator, activist and culture keeper.
