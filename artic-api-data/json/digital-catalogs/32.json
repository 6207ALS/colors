    "copy": " James McNeill Whistler, a nineteenth-century provocateur at the center of debates regarding the nature and methods of art making, pushed the boundaries of not only what was considered fine art but also how it was promoted and exhibited. Whistler Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago brings together new scholarship to illuminate the artist\u2019s historical significance in Chicago, analyze his holistic aesthetic explorations across media, and offer fresh insights into the experimental materials and technical decisions behind his beguiling art. Three essays, forty-eight curatorial entries, and ten technical summaries are enhanced by high-resolution and interactive images that invite a detailed exploration of Whistler\u2019s paintings and drawings.   Edited by Jay A. Clarke and Sarah Kelly Oehler; with essays by Kimberley Muir, Sarah Kelly Oehler, and Stephanie L. Strother; and entries by Kimberly Muir and Stephanie L. Strother.   This project was made possible by the Art Institute\u2019s partnership with the Lunder Consortium for Whistler Studies. ",
