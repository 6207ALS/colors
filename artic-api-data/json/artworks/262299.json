    "description": "<p>Trained as a classical cellist, Madeline Charlotte Moorman (1933\u20131991) achieved international renown as a performance artist and organizer of avant-garde festivals. Moorman\u2019s collaborations with such artists as Joseph Beuys, John Cage, Yoko Ono, Nam June Paik, and others, as well as her efforts to establish the Annual Avant Garde Festival in New York City, which ran from 1963 to 1980, earned her both acclaim and notoriety. This collection originated as a publication in conjunction with a private gallery exhibition of the same name in New York City in 2000. These papers include programs, posters, announcements, catalogs, and other ephemera from Moorman\u2019s associations with artists, musicians, and performers, as well as biographical and bibliographical information about Moorman.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Moorman,%20The%20World%20of%20Charlotte,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
