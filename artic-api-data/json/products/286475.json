Poured and decorated by hand in Lithuania using the highest quality German materials. Dripless, smokeless, self-extinguishing. Each candle comes with an easy-to-assemble steel base thus no need for any additional stand/tray. Arrives perfectly packaged in a box, ready for gifting.</span></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong><span data-sheets-formula-bar-text-style=\"font-size:13px;color:#000000;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;font-family:'Arial';font-style:normal;text-decoration-skip-ink:none;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">2.4 x 0.4 x 5.9 in.</span><br></li></ul>",
