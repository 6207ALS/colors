Yet as evidenced by his drawn oeuvre, produced over six decades, he continuously reinvented graphic modes of expression, revealing a restless and inquisitive eye. The Art Institute of Chicago holds nine life drawings the artist produced between 1900 and 1912 which show the artist\u2019s nascent linear economy and simplified forms: Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back (1900/01; cat. 1), Boats (1905; cat. 5), Grounded Fishing Boat (1905; cat. 6), Nude in Profile (1903/04, cat. 4), Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907; cat. 12), Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back (1908; cat. 15), Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with Sketch of a Foot (Aug. 1909; cat. 16), Girl with a Cat (1910; cat. 17), and Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool (1910; cat. 13). In two drawings the artist described fishing boats he observed at the French coast. In seven he investigated the female form in various poses, an effort closely allied with his contemporaneous sculptural explorations. Several of these works were shown in one or more of the three exhibitions Alfred Stieglitz (1864\u20131946) devoted to Matisse at his New York gallery, 291, in 1908, 1910, and 1912, respectively.\n\nOnly recently was it noted that these nine drawings have identical artist\u2019s mounts. Each is composed of layered papers with a false plate mark, which create a series of expanding borders around the drawing. In some examples, Matisse\u2019s signature extends from the drawing onto the mount, indicating they are original, a fact that has been has been overlooked until now (see fig. 1). The mounts are not discussed in the Matisse literature, they have rarely been reproduced in publication, and they have largely been overmatted for exhibition. Recognizing them as original acknowledges that it was Matisse\u2019s intention to have his drawings prepared in this specific manner.\n\nIn order to learn more about the mounts of these drawings, a paper conservator examined each with the aid of a stereomicroscope and critical light. By examining them as physical artifacts along with studying the historical context in which they were created, important determinations can be made. The materials, methods, and equipment used to construct them can be identified. Comparison with other artwork of the period indicates that Matisse deviated from tradition, mounting these works in a style popular for photographs rather than drawings. Examination of the materials and style, primary documents, and photographs mounted in the same manner identify the mounter as photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet (1867\u20131916). Studying Druet\u2019s own photographs on identical mounts provides information about the original size and nature of the Matisse drawing mounts. While we cannot know if Matisse considered his mounts practical, aesthetic, or both, studying their current condition, treatment histories, and inscriptions allows us to consider whether or not they were ever thought integral to the drawings\u2019 presentation. Looking to other collections, more Matisse drawings on original mounts can be identified.\n\nThe same materials and assembly method were used for all mounts. After trimming as needed, each drawing was laid down overall to a sheet of thin, smooth, cream wove paper trimmed to create a 1 cm border around the drawing. This paper was in turn laid down overall to a larger sheet of thick, soft, moderately textured, ivory wove plate paper. Raking light reveals a felt texture on the recto and a distinct fine screen pattern on the verso (see fig. 2). Because all the plate papers have been cut down, their original size cannot be determined from these mounts. The borders would have been wider and more visually substantial initially.\n\nA false plate mark with slightly rounded corners was impressed into the plate paper approximately 2\u20133 cm beyond the secondary support on each mount. (The mount on Grounded Fishing Boat [1905; cat. 6] is an exception as it has been trimmed within the plate mark.) Within the plate mark the felt texture of the tertiary support has been compressed, indicating significant pressure was used. Few plate marks are the same size and each appears customized to the drawing and secondary support dimensions. While it would have been cost prohibitive to produce metal plates to each size, cutting thin, rigid paperboard (like today\u2019s mat board) and running it through a press could have produced the observed effect. The notched corners support this scenario (see fig. 3).\n\nUnder magnification, a discrete edge of dry mount tissue is evident along the juncture between the sheets on each work, indicating it was used to adhere all layers of the mounts (see fig. 4). Patented in France in 1901, the new heat-activated adhesive was developed specifically to mount certain types of moisture-sensitive photographic papers prone to severe curling. It is made by brushing a mixture of shellac and other resins onto both sides of a thin tissue. Heat and pressure melt the adhesive and bond the paper and mount. Either an iron or a dry mount press (first advertised in 1904 as a screw press; see fig. 5) heated by burning paraffin, oil, gas, or alcohol, could be employed.\n\nTo mount the drawings, two sheets of dry mount tissue were trimmed: one to the dimensions of the drawing and the other to the size of the secondary support. The mount was assembled by inserting dry mount tissue between the drawing and secondary support and between the secondary and tertiary supports. Once perfectly aligned, an iron was likely used to melt the adhesive and fuse the layers together in one spot. Then the cardboard template for the plate mark would be set in place and the whole stack could be transferred to a dry mount press without the risk of layers shifting and becoming misaligned. The even heat and pressure a dry mount press provided would bond all the layers and simultaneously impress the plate mark. These Matisse works are the earliest dry mounted drawings this author has found, likely because the material was designed specifically for use with photographs.\n\nThere is a long French tradition of affixing prints and drawings to mounts with decorative lines, bands, and washes adorning the borders to provide a visual framework that marks the transition between image and surroundings. An example is Jacques-Louis David\u2019s drawing of Jeanbon Saint-Andr\u00e9 (see fig. 6). The decorative bands in gold leaf, pen and ink, and watercolor, typical of the French mount style, provide a visual border between the drawing and elaborate frame.Yet these Matisse mounts do not derive from French drawing mount traditions. Instead they have precedent in a specific photograph mount style popular in Europe and the United States throughout the later nineteenth century called an India-tint mount. These mounts were initially constructed by placing a sheet of Japanese paper (then referred to as India paper) between the photograph and plate paper to form an intermediate border. The technique is described in an 1863 issue of the American Journal of Photography: \u201cGood taste and fashion must always act as guides in mounting photographs. A good margin is generally valuable, and in many cases an inner margin, of an India-paper tint, gives great value to the whites of the photograph.\u201d Photographers undoubtedly appreciated the way the warm hues of Japanese paper complemented the warm highlights produced by early photographic processes.\n\nIn the 1880s British photographer Peter Henry Emerson (1856\u20131936) mounted his platinum prints in the same manner but substituted cream western paper for the Japanese sheet and added a plate mark. The addition of a plate mark may have initially been in imitation of the aesthetic of chine coll\u00e9, a graphic print process involving printing on Japanese or Chinese paper mounted to a larger sheet of western plate paper, as photographers sought to gain status for their works by aligning their photographs visually with more established intaglio print traditions (see fig. 7).\n\nIn a letter to the painter Paul Signac dated September 14, 1905, Matisse wrote: \u201cYesterday I had a visit from Felix F\u00e9n\u00e9on to whom I showed my Collioure work, that is to say, 40 watercolors, 100 drawings [dessins] all mounted Druet (so a big pile of paper) and 15 paintings.\u201d The letter refers to Eug\u00e8ne Druet, with whom Matisse exhibited his work. Druet operated a caf\u00e9 from 1893 to 1903, and it was then that his association with artists began. During that time he came to know Auguste Rodin (1840\u20131917) and photographed much of his sculpted oeuvre. He also organized a large Rodin retrospective at the 1900 Exposition Universelle, where he managed the sales of the artist\u2019s sculptures and drawings. Druet\u2019s success in this endeavor prompted him to open Galerie Druet in 1903. The gallery quickly established a strong following by showing Nabis, Symbolist, and Fauve artists. Druet held a solo exhibition of Matisse\u2019s work in 1906 (at which Pablo Picasso first discovered Matisse\u2019s woodcuts) and included him in numerous group exhibitions over the following years. Druet developed enough of a reputation in certain Parisian art circles to merit a mention in Gertrude Stein\u2019s book The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. Along with Ambroise Vollard and Paul Durand-Ruel, Stein lists Druet among dealers she and her brother met shortly after their 1904 arrival in Paris: \u201cand in entirely another part of Paris on the rue de Faubourg-Saint-Honor\u00e9 was the ex-caf\u00e9 keeper and photographer Druet.\u201d\n\nDruet was enterprising, and while operating his gallery he simultaneously developed a niche market for photographically reproducing artists\u2019 sculptures and paintings, which he in turn offered for sale through his gallery. Contemporaries admired the tonal range and accuracy of values Druet achieved photographically and felt that he represented artists\u2019 works authentically and with fidelity. Like many others, Matisse not only had Druet photograph his completed paintings but also document various stages in the progression of complex compositions including the monumental oil Bathers by a River (1909/10, May\u2013Nov. 1913, and early spring 1916\u2013c. Oct. 1917; cat. 25).\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris, houses four large albums of Druet\u2019s photographs of Matisse\u2019s paintings mounted in the same manner as the Matisse drawings in the Art Institute of Chicago (see fig. 8). They are dry mounted to cream wove paper with a 1 cm border and then to a larger sheet of the same plate paper used for the drawings, with the characteristic fine screen pattern on the verso. These mounts also have a plate mark impressed into the plate paper.\n\nUnlike with the drawing mounts, here Druet stamped the photographs and mounts with various proprietary marks including a red ink stamp that reads \u201cPhot. Proc\u00e9d\u00e9 Druet.\u201d In the lower right corner of the photographs is Druet\u2019s blind stamp insignia, a 2 cm diameter circle with \u201cDRUET\u201d running from top to bottom in block letters and a small circle to the right and left of the text. The same insignia appears on numerous Galerie Druet exhibition announcements (see fig. 9 and fig. 10). In the lower margin of the plate papers there is a blind stamp reading \u201cE. Druet / 114 FAUB ST HONORE\u00b4/ PARIS.\u201d This was the address for the gallery from 1903 to 1910, when it moved permanently to 20, rue Royale (fig. 11).\n\nThe photograph mounts are preserved intact, retaining their edges and original dimensions, and so provide insight into the initial appearance of the mounts of Matisse\u2019s drawings. The large, untrimmed plate papers measure 54 \u00d7 42.5 cm. The mount edges have a distinct serrated pattern on at least three sides (one long edge is covered by cloth tape used to tip the mounts into the album). The jagged edges have a regular pattern of closely spaced notches that may indicate Druet purchased the sheets in stacks bound in string or wire that indented the edges or may reflect another aspect of their manufacture (see fig. 12).\n\nAlthough engaging in their immediacy and dynamism, the Matisse drawings are mostly small studies and sketches, some with subtle creases, irregular edges, and media the artist smudged across the sheet while working. Certainly the formal mounts, with their expanding borders, plate marks, and generous margins, served to visually elevate these small sheets and lend them stature. One can imagine the drawing mounts at their original size, prior to being cut down, provided substantially wider borders, which would have lent the drawings even greater presence and monumentality.\n\nThe mounts served a practical as well an aesthetic function: protecting the drawings during handling, storage, and framing. Being mounted to a large, rigid support ensured the drawings would remain flat, with little risk of bending or creasing. The margins provided space for handling without touching the drawing directly. Being already mounted, the drawings were never subjected to deleterious tapes used for hinging into window mats.\n\nThe mounts have largely succeeded in safeguarding the drawings, but they themselves have suffered over time. They have been trimmed, written upon, torn, soiled, and taped. In the past, custodians of these works have written cataloging information directly on the front of the mounts, essentially treating them like an external mat, which ensured the mounts would not be presented when framed (see fig. 13). Inherent vice in the form of biologically derived foxing has also marred two of the mounts. Some bear mat-burn stains from old, acidic window mats (see fig. 14). All have been cut down from their original dimensions.\n\nMatisse\u2019s intentions in regards to the exhibition of the mounts cannot be known. Based on their current condition, handling history, and the inscriptions found on rectos and versos, it can be deduced that they, at least for a large part of their history, have not been interpreted or treated as artist-sanctioned mounts meant to be preserved intact as part of the drawing presentation. Some drawings have mat burn stains from contact with acidic window mats or display light-strike, a darkening of the paper within the window mat from excess light exposure. These condition features prove the mounts were covered by window mats for some time, likely following their owners\u2019 desire to unite the drawings visually with other works in their collection. Four works bear inscriptions indicating matting choices or directing the mounts to be cut down.\n\nInscriptions on the back of three of the Art Institute\u2019s Matisse drawings exhibited at 291, Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back (1900/01; cat. 1), Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907; cat. 12), and Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool (1910; cat. 13), provide clues about their early frame styles and indicate that Stieglitz had the mount margins cut down for close framing very soon after they were made (see fig. 15). On Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back there is a graphite inscription at the center of the lower edge of the verso that reads \u201cStieglitz A 1/2 107-31 Dull / R 11 3/4 \u00d7 16 1/2.\u201d On Standing Female Nude with Chair there is a graphite inscription on the lower edge of the verso that reads \u201cStieglitz, 1/2 flat pol [ ] 12 \u00d7 15.\u201d On Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool there is a graphite inscription on the lower edge of the verso that reads \u201cStieglitz, A 1/2 107 - 31, dull, R 12 \u00d7 15.\u201d These are framer\u2019s marks, likely written by either George Of, a framer used frequently by Stieglitz for his gallery, or by F. Dunn, the manager of Of\u2019s framing business. Comparison with an invoice from Of to Stieglitz dated June 12, 1913, illuminates the abbreviated inscriptions (fig. 16). Frames are listed with a letter (here A) followed by a fraction measurement (1/2), possibly indicating the profile dimension, then by a code likely denoting a frame style (107-31) and the finish type, \u201cdull\u201d or \u201cflat pol\u201d (flat polish). This is followed by the letter R and the rebate dimensions. All three mounts retain the dimensions listed for the rebates in the inscriptions.\n\nThe pen-and-ink work Grounded Fishing Boat (1905; cat. 6) was first owned by the collector Leo Stein, who lived with his sister, Gertrude, in Paris. The mount has an enigmatic inscription in broken French: Encadred de facon a pas motrer de blanc autour (fig. 17). (The correct spelling and grammar for this phrase would read: Encadrer de fa\u00e7on \u00e0 ne pas montrer de blanc autour.) The phrase translates to \u201cframe so as to not to show white around.\u201d It is unclear who gave this directive and when, but it must have been while the drawing resided in French hands, prior to 1956 (see provenance). It is unclear if the onset of the severe staining pattern currently visible prompted the instruction to overmat the mount or if it was simply the preference not to show it. Another note on the verso in the same hand, \u201coiseau blanc contre blue fonc\u00e9,\u201d translates as \u201cwhite bird against dark blue\u201d and designates the desired color scheme for the mat window, a departure from Matisse\u2019s mount.\n\nNow that the original nature of the drawing mounts has been recognized in the nine Art Institute drawings it becomes possible to look in other collections for further examples. Twelve other Matisse drawings on the same mounts have been identified thus far in four other American museum collections: Nude Female Model Seated on Floor (c. 1898; Baltimore Museum of Art), Nude Male Model Seated on a Stool (c. 1898; Baltimore Museum of Art), Nude Female Model Seated on a Stool, Facing Right (c. 1900; Baltimore Museum of Art), Seated Nude (c. 1900; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Nude Resting on One Arm (c. 1901\u201303; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), View of Collioure (c. 1904\u201305; Princeton University Art Museum), The Harbor at Collioure (1905; Baltimore Museum of Art), Walking Nude (1905\u201306; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Reclining Male Nude (c. 1907; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Nude (c. 1908; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), Untitled (Nude Study) (c. 1908/09; Museum of Modern Art, New York), and Standing Nude (1908\u201309; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).\n\nSurely admiring the handsome, sturdy mounts and perhaps impressed with the efficiency of the new dry mount press technology, Matisse engaged Druet to prepare his drawings in an identical fashion over an extended period. In the 1905 letter to Signac mentioned earlier, Matisse referred to \u201c40 watercolors, 100 drawings [dessins] all mounted Druet.\u201d From the dates of the Art Institute drawings it is apparent that Matisse continued to have Druet mount his works until at least 1914 and possibly until Druet\u2019s death in 1916, and so there are doubtlessly numerous examples of the artist\u2019s work still on original mounts yet to be recognized. Though curatorial and custodial considerations, including the condition of the mounts, will determine whether they should be displayed in exhibition, the Druet mounts should be recognized as part of Matisse\u2019s intended presentation. Every effort should be made to preserve them as part of the drawings\u2019 original context.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">\u201cA series of sketches by Matisse, mostly in heavy pencil but also in pen and ink, are mounted in the same way, with Matisse\u2019s signature across both the primary and secondary papers.\u201d Rachel Mustalish, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Stieglitz and His Artists: Matisse to O\u2019Keeffe, ed.
