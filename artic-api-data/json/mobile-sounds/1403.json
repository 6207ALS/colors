    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: What we\u2019re looking at here is a composite animal. You can see that it has both wings and scales while its body looks like a mammal\u2019s. Western scholars have often speculated about where intriguing mythical beasts like this one originated. But no one really knows for sure. Likewise, no one knows for sure what this imagery beast signified. It may have been meant to keep away evil influences but it\u2019s certainly more engaging than confrontational. We do know how this likeable little creature functioned. It was probably one of a pair. Each creature held a vertical post in the square hole at the base of the neck. The two posts were joined by a cross piece. Suspended from the cross piece were clay bells or chimes. These surrogate instruments imitating bronze bells and stone chimes were undoubtedly two fragile to be played. Their music was obviously designed to resound only in the afterlife. In earlier times the prototypes of this clay sculpture were made of costly bronze and buried in the tombs of the aristocracy. By the Han period, that is the first two centuries B.C.E., when this one was made clay replicas were largely mass produced to satisfy the demand for burial goods by an expanding middle class.</p>\n",
