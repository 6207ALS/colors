    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This earthen ware head represents that of a warrior. His simple mask-like face conveys a sense of dignity and strength. Notice how the horizontal forms of his eyes are echoed by his mouth and eyebrows and balanced by the slim vertical line of its nose. Areas of reddish paint represent face decoration and the design details of his cap. The head was once part of a whole figurine designed to be placed by a tomb. It was made in the sixth century during the late Kofun period in Japan named after the sophisticated funerary customs of the time. Kofun literary means old burial mound. At this time, members of the ruling class were buried inside large earth mounds. Elaborate rituals probably accompanied the burial and the mounds were surrounded by many Haniwa or funerary earthenware objects like this warrior. Other forms included figures of men and women, houses and different kinds of animals. These symbolic objects acted as offerings. They\u2019re also believed to have represented possessions that could help provide for the deceased in the afterlife.</p>\n",
