His early work in the 1960s took the form of brightly painted plaster reliefs and sculptures of foodstuffs and other commercial products. Later the canvas props that Oldenburg had sewn for earlier performancebased events led to large-scale soft sculptures. By the mid-1960s, the artist turned his attention to drawings and proposals for outdoor monuments\u2014some imaginary, some real. A 45-foot-tall version of <em>Clothespin</em> is installed near City Hall in Philadelphia.</p>\n",
