    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: At the top of this enormously dramatic painting, Christ miraculously rises from the dead after his crucifixion and burial.  Beneath him, an angel in white gestures upward, commanding the attention of the soldiers who have been sleeping as they guard Christ's tomb.  Their astonishment at this miracle is vividly expressed in their faces.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: You have the sense of individuals in life reacting to a very shocking experience, an unexpected experience, and you see it marked all over the faces, which is heightened by this sense of these bright lights that shine upon one half of the face and then leave the other side of the face in shadow.  So there's a great theatricality and a great drama to the use of light in this painting.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The painting was made in Rome around 1620 by Cecco del Caravaggio, a close follower of the short-lived Baroque master Caravaggio.  Cecco adopted Caravaggio's innovations.  These instituted a bold use of chiaroscuro, or contrasts of light and dark, and painting from live models rather than using drawings, as was common practice in this period, to create this realistic scene.  Here we can imagine the model for Christ kneeling on a cushion, which the artist has transformed into a cloud, and the classical relief in the lower right corner was a well-known Roman fragment, which Cecco must have seen and copied.</p>\n",
