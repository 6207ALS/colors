    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  From the scrolls of foliage along the body and neck to the scalloped rows of fan shapes at the end of the spout, the entire surface of this silver teapot is covered with decoration. This abundance of detail was inspired in part by the esthetic movement of the late nineteenth century. Although this movement\u2019s ideals rejected the excessive use of detail, ornamentation was still highly valued in the design of beautiful and functional objects. The stylized elements on this teapot convey a luxurious yet refined harmony of form and shape. The esthetic movement also inspired a fascination with Eastern or otherwise exotic designs. This teapot manufactured in America by the whiting company was considered Moorish at the time. The word Moorish conjures the Muslim culture of Spain and North Africa, but very few of the details on the teapot are strictly Muslim in design. Just as Westerners imagined Japanese art as being spare and simple they thought Moorish art should be dense and elaborate. What appeared to be exotic was not always truly Eastern. The result was a shorthand of design elements that merely suggested the East.</p>\n",
