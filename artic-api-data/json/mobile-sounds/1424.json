    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Two men of different religious faiths attack one another on horseback in this dramatic scene. Painter Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix called this \u201cThe Combat of the Giaour and Hassan\u201d after a poem written by Lord Byron. The man on the right is the Muslim Hassan. On the left an unnamed Giaour or Christian is about to thrust his knife. The Giaour has ambushed Hassan in retaliation for the murder of his lover Leila. Leila had belonged to Hassan\u2019s harem but had been lured away by the Giaour. For her betrayal she was thrown in a sack and drowned by Hassan. This painting captures the moment of Hassan\u2019s death as described in these lines taken from Byron\u2019s poem.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: \u201cHis breast with wings on numbered riven, his back to earth, his face to heaven. Fallen Hassan lies. His unclosed eye yet lowering on his enemy as if the hour that sealed his fate surviving left his quenchless hate.\u201d<br>Narrator:  Delacroix and Byron were artists who romanticized and exaggerated the otherness of the Eastern Muslim. This characterization perpetuated the idea of the Muslim as a ruthless and lawless figure, an image and both fascinated and alarmed Europeans in the early nineteenth century.&quot;</p>\n",
