    "description": "<p>A clever, quirky, read-aloud biography of a leading modern artist, for kids. Artist Yves Klein always thought about how he could surprise his\u00a0audience. One day, he decided that he would only paint in one color\u2014blue. He painted canvases, globes, branches, gallery floors, and even covered\u00a0people in blue paint. Klein's story is told here with wit and eccentricity, perfectly paired with black-lines illustrations and blue splashes galore.\u00a0Fausto Gilberti brings movement, life, and whimsy to the the true life story of one the most important modern French artists of our time.</p>",
