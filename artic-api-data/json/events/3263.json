    "description": "<p>Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin, together known as Studio Formafantasma, are an Italian design duo based in Amsterdam. Since graduating from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2009, Trimarchi and Farresin have developed a body of work celebrated for its combination of research, craftsmanship, and experimentation. Their Botanica  project, for example, investigates the possibilities of oil-free polymers, creating objects with preindustrial organic compounds, such as resin made of sawdust and animal blood. Pieces from this celebrated project are held in museum collections around the world, including that of the Art Institute of Chicago.   </p><p>Trimarchi and Farresin\u2019s interests also drive their teaching in the Well Being and Contextual Design departments of the Design Academy Eindhoven and as heads of the MADE Program in Siracusa, Italy, focusing on the intersection of craft, design, and local culture. Formafantasma have received numerous awards for their work and were identified by critic Alice Rawsthorn as one of a handful of practices that would shape the future of design.</p>",
