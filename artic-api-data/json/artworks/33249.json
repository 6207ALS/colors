    "description": "<p>This painting depicts a scene from the life of Scipio Africanus, the Roman general who defeated Hannibal in the Battle of Zama (in present-day Tunisia) in 202 BCE. Here Scipio demonstrates his leadership by acting with restraint (\u201ccontinence\u201d) in refusing to hold a woman as a captive of war. According to the story on which the painting is based, the woman\u2019s fianc\u00e9, shown kneeling beside her, was a powerful prince who agreed to a military alliance with Scipio in gratitude for his lenience. The theatrical setting and costumes\u2014the invented military helmets, anachronistically dressed characters, fanciful architecture, and gravity-defying drapery, for example\u2014 suggest that the artist\u2019s aims were allegorical rather than historical, intended above all to illustrate for viewers the virtues of compassionate diplomacy.</p>\n",
