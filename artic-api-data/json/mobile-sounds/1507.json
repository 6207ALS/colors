    "transcript": "<p>Note: Since the recording of this audio stop, new research has led to a re-identification of the sitters. Rather than Mrs. Andrew Bedford Bankson and son, Gunning Bedford Bankson, the sitters are more likely Elizabeth Grant Bankson Beatty (Mrs. James Beatty) and her daughter Susan. Bankson and Beatty were sisters-in-law.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The painter of this charming portrait was one of the earliest African American artists to be known by name and reputation. Joshua Johnson came to America as a slave from Saint-Dominique, now Haiti, and became a free man sometime before 1796. Johnson worked in Baltimore as a portrait painter, nevertheless, fear of capture by slave traders limited his ability to travel in search of commissions. As a result, most of his clients were from white middle-class families in Baltimore, many of whom were abolitionists. Johnson became particularly known for his sensitive depictions of children. The young mother in this painting wears a modest yet fashionable dress, trimmed with a delicate line of imported lace, and a double circle of pale glass beads in her hair. The child wears a necklace of coral beads and holds a strawberry, a delicacy Johnson often included in his portraits. Now this may surprise you, that child on Mrs. Bankson's lap is her son, Gunning Bedford Bankson, not her daughter. In the 19th century, children of both sexes were dressed almost identically as infants. They didn\u2019t begin wearing boys' or girls' outfits until they were about six.</p>\n",
