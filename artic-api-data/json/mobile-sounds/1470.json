    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The delicate rendering of the robes on this standing Buddha is typical of the Sarnath School which flourished during the fifth century in India and is generally regarded as the classical period of Indian art.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: The Sarnath School was renowned for showing standing Buddhas and seated Buddhas with drapery that was almost diaphanous. And the style was to reveal the body of the Buddha without showing too many striations of the monastic robe. You just barely see the monastic robe around the neck, covering both shoulders and then around the arms and the feet of the Buddha.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The impact of the Sarnath style first appears in early representations of the Buddha from Central Asia and China and, in particular, southeast Asia. The standing body comes from Thailand perhaps from a regional center of the Mantuaravati [ph?] culture of the seventh through ninth centuries. The bulky slightly squat proportions of the body are local interpretations of the classical Indian style as reimagined in the Mantuaravati style.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Unfortunately, the hands of this Buddha are broken, but we can estimate the mudras or gesture in which the hands would have been placed.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Most Mantuaravati Buddha\u2019s stand in a frontal fixed stance and hold both their hands with the palm raised and the forefinger and thumb joined in the gesture of teaching or the tarka mudra. Both the classical stance you see here and the portrayal of the seated Buddha in meditation in a comforting calming presence were popular throughout southeast Asia.</p>\n",
