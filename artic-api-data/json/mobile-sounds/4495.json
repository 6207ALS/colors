    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Do you sense anything odd about this painting? [pause] Notice the outfit the woman is wearing. She seems a bit bundled up for the spring background behind her, right? That\u2019s not a coincidence. Here, we find Manet pulling a little trick. Curator, Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: Scholars have come to realize that this is not a real garden at all, but is rather one of Manet\u2019s own paintings. And the way we\u2019ve come to this conclusion is because of this blue element that you see just to the right of the woman reading, which is actually a water pail.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Manet used this same backdrop in paintings from the 1880s. In fact, you can see another example of it in the portrait of Madame Gamby also in this gallery.</p>\n<p>By 1880, Manet had become less mobile due to illness, and could not longer make it out to the cafes, parks, and other Parisian scenes that he loved painting. Instead, he resorted to recreating the scenes in his studio. Here he combines garden scene likely painted while in the suburbs with a modern Parisian women drinking a beer, whose portrait was done back in Paris.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: The whole concept is that she is a modern woman. She has her bock of beer, she\u2019s out by herself, she\u2019s concentrating not on the latest political news but probably on what she\u2019s going to go consume next at the Galeries Lafayette. And so she\u2019s the picture of a fashionable Parisian\u2014a type that he said he wanted to show in all of their beauty, in all of their grace and glamour.</p>\n",
