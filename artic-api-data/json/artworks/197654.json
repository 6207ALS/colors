Admiral Evans is known the world over as &quot;Fighting Bob,&quot; the pride of the American Navy, and the idol of the American sailor.  He has a long and interesting history, full of stirring events from the day he graduated from Annapolis up to the present time.  He was in the Indian battles of the far West, and had the luck to be present and took an active part in all of the many naval affairs since the Civil War.  In August, 1908, he will be made either Vice-Admiral or placed on the retired list.</p>\n",
