    "description": "<p>Trope Chicago is comprised of 206 images produced by 27 independent\u00a0photographers from Chicago and beyond. This carefully curated and bound collection is divided into eight chapters, primarily\u00a0focused on the lakefront and downtown areas that showcase iconic buildings, streets, and parks. Each chapter is accompanied\u00a0by a map of the area along with the locations where the photographs were taken. The collection is first and foremost about\u00a0photography; images reflect the interests of the photographers rather than serving as a comprehensive guide to the city. With its\u00a0magnificent skyline, public art, and unparalleled lakefront, Chicago is one of the most photographed cities in the world. Coupled\u00a0with the infamous Chicago weather-ever changing, unexpected, unrepentant- the city makes for a spectacular collection of images.</p><p>Hardcover</p><p>8.5 in. x 1.2 in. x 10.8 in.</p><p>3.2 lbs.</p>",
