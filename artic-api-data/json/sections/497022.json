The triple alliance of Pompey, Julius Caesar, and Crassus in 60 B.C. had accelerated their high-handed and often illegal maneuvers to muzzle opposition, while each warily watched the others for signs that one was about to make a run for supreme rule and leave the others behind. Caesar continued his wildly successful campaign to conquer Gaul, making Pompey jealous of his achievements and popularity.\n\nIn this year, the consul L. Marcius Philippus, who had married the widow Atia, a niece of Julius Caesar, struck this coin. The obverse bears the diademed head of Philippus\u2019s ancestor Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome. The lituus, or augur\u2019s staff, behind him may refer to a relative who held that position.\n\nThe remarkable reverse illustrates one of the earliest aqueducts of Rome, the Aqua Marcia (fig. 27.1), traditionally said to be built by that same king but in fact built circa 144 B.C. by a more recent ancestor, Quintus Marcius Rex, whose cognomen refers to his descent from a king. The moneyer\u2019s own cognomen Philippus curls at the edge of the coin, and an equestrian statue puns on that name, \u201clover of horses\u201d in Greek; but the repetition of the family name Marcius in the arches of the aqueduct makes sure that no one can miss the royal forebear and recall what a great benefit he brought to the city of Rome. Philippus, a master of realpolitik, may have sensed that very soon his wife\u2019s uncle would be king in all but name. He surely had a profound influence on his wife\u2019s son by an earlier marriage, Octavian, who would end the Republic that had originated as a rejection of monarchy.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the Republic, not only the three official moneyers could strike coinage\u2014consuls and generals of provinces could do so as well.\n\nThe diadem is the ancient headwear of royalty in the Greek and early Roman world. Iconographically it was associated with Alexander the Great and connoted absolute monarchy. What we think of as a crown today, the spiky radiate crown, is associated with the Sun and is used only rarely before the third century A.D. See Stout, \u201cJewelry as a Symbol of Status.\u201d\n\nThe early kings are known to us mostly through legends; Ancus Marcius is said to have lived in the late seventh century B.C.\n\nIt was the third aqueduct in Rome, funded by the recent conquests of Carthage and Corinth. It remained the longest ever built in Rome, at 91 kilometers, and was in use until the tenth century A.D.\n\nSee Gray-Fow, \u201cStepfather\u2019s Gift,\u201d esp. p. 194.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 27 Denarius (Coin) Portraying King Ancus Marcius, 56 B.C.\n\nfig. 27.1 The Aqua Marcia, c. 144 B.C.
