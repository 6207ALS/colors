Capturing a quintessentially Impressionist setting\u2014a sun-dappled landscape with women and children enjoying leisure time\u2014the artist also utilized the movement\u2019s technique of broken brushwork and the use of brilliant colors. In the painting the children converse and frolic at the water\u2019s edge on a windy day. There is nothing threatening about the waves or wind; indeed, Potthast\u2019s paintings were both praised and criticized for presenting nothing other than a pleasant, innocent, and optimistic view.</p>\n",
