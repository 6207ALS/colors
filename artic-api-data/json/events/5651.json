    "description": "<p>Join Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Associate Curator of European Painting and Sculpture Rebecca Long for a discussion of Diego&nbsp;Vel\u00e1zquez's early career in 17th-century Seville.</p><p>As the major European port to the New World, Seville in the 1600s had not only incredible wealth but also a culture of significant intellectual debate, religious fervor, and mounting ethnic tensions. This lecture investigates&nbsp;how Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s early work reflects the complicated social dynamics of the city where he spent his formative years, raising questions about the place of women and racial minorities in Spanish society, the nature of artistic creativity, and the role of religion in everyday life.</p><p>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.&nbsp;In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination, though anyone who would like to wear a mask is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 in the week before your visit, we ask that you stay home.&nbsp;We appreciate your help in keeping the museum a healthy and safe place for our staff and visitors.
