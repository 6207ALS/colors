Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The thick-walled vessel has a rim rounded by reheating that was flared out and then folded in and flattened horizontally to create a substantial lip. The neck spreads out in a straight-sided wall, forming the long shoulder before bending down and in to an elegant ovoid form that tapers inward and is constricted just above the bottom of the vessel. The base is flat and slightly kicked with no pontil mark. Two substantial gathers of glass were applied at the shoulder and pulled up under the rim to form the opposing handles. One handle was tooled into three ribs, the other was less carefully applied and has one irregular rib. Both handles are flattened. The lid, fashioned from the same glass, is thick-walled, blown, and tooled. The edge of the lid is rounded by reheating, horizontally flattened, and has a domical center with a solid button top. The underside retains an unusual dark, arc-shaped scar that may be a pontil mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 115.1.\n\nA section of the rim and neck is restored. There is a chip on the rim and a horizontal strain crack at the base of one handle. The overall surface is dull and pitted with some slight iridescence.\n\nSubstantial large vessels such as these were used in the home for food storage and in cemeteries as containers for the ashes of the deceased. Although it is impossible to know which was the use of this particular vessel, it is a particularly elegant form and one would like to think it might have contained the ashes of a Roman of some means. The vessels were often secured within a lead container for protection or in a carved stone cylinder with a simple disk-shaped stone lid. Following the typical practice of cremation in this period, the ashes that sometimes contained objects, such as small glass unguentaria, were placed in these jars. These small glasses were often deformed from the intense heat of the funeral pyre. Cinerary urns are more commonly found in the western Roman Empire rather than in the east.\n\nThe profile of this particular cinerary urn is very tall and elegant, reminiscent of a classical Greek amphora. The most common shape of cinerary urns is a globular form, usually with a lid but without handles. Of the nearly sixty urns published in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, nearly half are simple globular urns with horizontal rims. Tall and more substantial forms related to the Art Institute\u2019s urn often have heavy handles applied. The closest shape in Clasina Isings\u2019s typology is form 63, and especially related urns found in Trier and France. A good example of this related type is in the Corning Museum of Glass. Probably the closest parallel was found in a grave in the Roman necropolis at Poitiers in 1930 and dated to the second half of the first to the second century A.D.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Arveiller-Dulong and Nenna, Les verres antiques 2, pp. 159\u201379, nos. 438\u201362, for simple globular forms; nos. 463\u201391, for more elaborate profiles, most with handles; nos. 493\u2013515, for various lids.\n\nIsings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, pp. 81\u201383, form 63, is the closest profile.\n\nGoethert-Polaschek, Katalog der r\u00f6mischen Gl\u00e4ser, p. 246, nos. 1460\u201361, pl. 77, form 151, form pl.
