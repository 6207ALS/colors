    "description": "<p><em>Talavera poblana</em>, a tin-glazed earthenware, was made in the central Mexican town of Puebla beginning in the sixteenth-century. The name likely refers to the majolica-producing city of Talavera de la Reina in Spain. <em>Talavera</em> emulated the designs of fashionable imported Spanish ceramics; like its Spanish prototypes, it showed the influence of Islamic, Chinese, Italian, and French ceramics, all present in cosmopolitan Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and transmitted to Mexico during the colonial period. The shape of this jar resembles that of a Chinese <em>quan</em> vessel. Its decorative treatment includes flowering bands and sinuous vines with abstracted sunflower-like blossoms. The blue-and-white body is enlivened by polychrome panels with abstract vegetal motifs at the base of the vessel.</p>\n",
