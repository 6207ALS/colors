For this vignette he used the back of the same block on which he carved Mahana atua four years earlier (cat. 80). On the same side, he also carved a second vignette, Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available wood block was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers onto his prints. The block is extant, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 120.2.2).\n\nIn impressions of the third state, negative space has been created around the word Taiti. The artist carved away part of the block to increase the contrast between his inscription and the background.\n\nThe artist pasted an impression of the third state of this print onto page 188 of his manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 120.2.3), which suggests that it held particular significance for him. A detail of the lower left of that impression highlights the subtle, and often obscured, PG monogram and the flourishes around it (fig. 120.2.4).\n\nFox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues of Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints, none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThis third-state impression is printed in black ink.\n\nThe thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper was irregularly trimmed so that in the lower right ink offset is visible. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block. The sheet was posthumously laid down onto a thicker and much larger sheet of Japanese paper.\n\n103 \u00d7 186 mm (image); 123 \u00d7 228 mm (sheet, max.); 142 \u00d7 333 mm (secondary support)\n\nThe work was treated to reduce adhesive staining in the corners of the secondary support. It was then humidified and flattened to reduce undulation and handling dents.\n\nThe work is in sound and stable condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper.
