    "transcript": "<p>JAMES RONDEAU: In 1979, H\u00e9lio leaves New York after nearly nine years and returns to Rio. Returns home. And he has almost two full years of creative work in Rio that really has been given very scant attention. Certainly the clearest, strongest major statement made at the end of the career is this installation, Rijanviera, which H\u00e9lio makes in 1979 and I think it is absolutely the third and final portrait of place, portrait of Brazil. We\u2019ve encountered Tropicalia, we\u2019ve encountered Eden, and now we encounter Rijanviera. And it is in some ways the most tranquil. You feel the cityscape of Manhattan, you feel the greys of the concrete, the greys of the skyscrapers. He does it for the lobby of a hotel on Copa Cabana beach. And there is contained within Rijanviera sand and water, so it\u2019s crossing the street, if you will. It\u2019s building a bridge between the beach that so famously defines Rio in so many ways. But also if you look outside the door, if you look towards the exit from this gallery, you\u2019re looking right back at the Hunting Dogs from 1961.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re seeing H\u00e9lio really come full circle, we have here a realized version of the enclosure, a realized version of the labyrinth, the notion of multi sensory experience, all of that here is being given form. I think you can begin to see both the commonalities, but also the evolution in H\u00e9lio\u2019s thinking, so it is really in some ways, because H\u00e9lio tragically dies shortly after this piece is realized, it represents the apotheosis of the ideas that we\u2019ve seen in the exhibition. But I also think we can begin to understand through things that we\u2019ve just passed by, we can imagine where this artist might have been going. So we see something fully realized but we also sense in Rijanviera a career and a life cut short.</p>\n",
