(no. 1996, as The Balcony); Chicago 1900b (no. 45); New York 1901 (no. 146)\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest that Whistler made lithographs between early February 1894, when he drew Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81), and the morning of July 1 of that year, when he produced this image of Parisians gathered to watch the funeral procession of Marie Fran\u00e7ois Sadi Carnot (1837\u20131894), president of the French Republic. Carnot had been stabbed to death by an Italian anarchist in Lyons on 24 June 1894. Whistler watched the cortege from a window overlooking the rue de Rivoli, and as he did, he created two lively transfer drawings (cat. 82 and cat. 83) of spectators clustered on the sunny balconies and in the windows of a building directly opposite his own vantage point.\n\nWhistler sent the drawings to the Ways in London the very next day, 2 July 1894, and declared the trial proofs of the two transfers \u201cbeautiful\u201d when he received them in Paris a few days later. He then proceeded to make a pen-and-ink tracing of part of The Long Balcony, marking a small line in red ink to indicate a portion of the original drawing that he wished the Ways to remove from the stone (\u201cWhistler-Way Correspondence,\u201d letter 90, fig. 7). Where the line passed through the shadowed sections of one of the parasols, he cautioned the printers that it should be \u201cpicked accross [sic] only very delicately\u201d (letter 90). In the same letter, Whistler wrote that he wanted twenty-five proofs of each of the new lithographs, adding \u201cthat is 20 more of each of the \u2018windows\u2019.\u201d This would imply that they had already sent him five proofs of the two balcony subjects before he suggested the correction to The Long Balcony.\n\nSeveral letters written from Whistler to T. R. Way in July mention the fact that he was sending the printers Japanese paper (which he described as \u201cthe beautiful Japanese\u201d) to use for impressions of several new lithographs. This must have been the rather heavy Japanese vellum (often appearing with at least one deckle edge) that was used for the majority of lifetime impressions of both The Long Balcony and The Little Balcony (cat. 83). It is very similar to the paper that Andr\u00e9 Marty had sent to the Ways from Paris when they printed The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) for L\u2019Estampe originale in December 1893.\n\nThe horizontal line crossing the left parasol in the central group of three has not yet been removed (fig. 82a).\n\nGLASGOW:HAG, golden-yellow Japanese paper (303 \u00d7 232 mm), signed.
