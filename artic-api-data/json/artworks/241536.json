    "description": "<p>In the early 1970s <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/57701/robert-sengstacke\">Robert \u201cBobby\u201d A. Sengstacke</a> created photographic assemblages for exhibitions at spaces such as the South Side Community Arts Center. This assemblage focuses on the work of the Zambezi Art Guild, which was founded in 1966 by artist Nii Oti (born Timothy Williams) on Chicago\u2019s South Side. The guild was created to encourage pride in Black history and expose local residents to crafts that reflect Africa\u2019s rich cultural heritage. Oti ran several storefront operations on the South Side, one of which is seen at center. Sengstacke\u2019s collage depicts exhibitions, examples of the guild\u2019s crafts, and members at work. This range of images and the collage format emphasize unity and community pride\u2014driving forces behind the many artistic collectives that emerged at the height of Chicago\u2019s Black Arts Movement.</p>\n",
