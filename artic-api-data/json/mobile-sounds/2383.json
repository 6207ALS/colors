    "transcript": "<p>MATT WITKOVSKY: Soviet sculptor Vladimir Tatlin thought up his Letatlin as a flying machine for the common citizen. His \u201cpersonal plane\u201d had a basket where a pilot stretched out lengthwise, hands on the wing controls. Connected to the basket were two wing struts, like the one seen here, that spanned nearly 33 feet.  The Letatlin gave shape to the soaring aspirations of Russia\u2019s October Revolution.</p>\n<p>MARK STEINBERG: If there\u2019s one word that everybody thought the revolution was about, that\u2019s freedom,  especially among ordinary people, especially among peasants and workers. And it often looks like what we know as freedom\u2014civil rights and the like. But in the context of the almost romantic, festive, utopian spirit, freedom takes on all sorts of other categories.</p>\n<p>MATT WITKOVSKY: Liberation was a common goal of many otherwise varied and diverse experiments in art.</p>\n<p>MARK STEINBERG: One of the great experiments of the time was an orchestra with no conductor because \u201cwho needs leadership?\u201d Clothing. Who needs clothing?  It\u2019s just because we\u2019re so ashamed of our bodies. We should go around naked in public, another big movement in the 1920s, actually. New visions of family, new visions of sexual relations, ideas about the city of the future, ideas about a culture that looks like nothing ever seen before. So there\u2019s this constant sense just like Tatlin and his little beautiful structure you can do the impossible and elevate above the ordinary.</p>\n",
