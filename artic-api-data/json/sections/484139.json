Waller Fund, 1926.441\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">This torso, which once belonged to a life-size statue, depicts a nude male youth in a contrapposto stance (fig. 18.1). Here the figure\u2019s weight is placed on its missing left leg, with the left hip raised and the right lowered, while the missing right leg was presumably bent at the knee. This diagonal is reversed in the positioning of the upper body, as the left shoulder is dropped and the right is raised, in effect creating a pronounced S curve throughout the body, which is best seen in three-quarter view (fig. 18.2).\n\nThe subject\u2019s youth is suggested by his soft physique, which includes subtle hints of muscular definition in the chest and in the upper back. It is also reinforced by the slender proportions of the torso and thighs, particularly in the rising diagonal of the groin, which further enhances his willowy appearance. The sensuous treatment of the youthful body extends fully around the figure to its back, where one finds a swath of twisted drapery that reaches across the slightly muscular upper back while revealing the rounded buttocks (fig. 18.3). Thus, it is apparent that this figure was meant to be viewed in the round, rather than displayed against a wall or in a niche. This drapery likely extended around to the front, where it might have wrapped over one or both of the youth\u2019s arms. It clearly did not cover the figure as a garment, but rather it might have been added to create a tactile contrast between the form of the body with its smooth flesh and the texture (and perhaps color) of the drapery, the folds of which were rendered largely with a drill (fig. 18.4).\n\nBased on its form and style, this torso belongs to a genre of similar statues of barely pubescent male subjects, which are characterized by relaxed, often languid poses and supple physiques that imbued the figures with a sense of underlying eroticism. In examples preserving the figure\u2019s head, it is typically turned downward, with the eyes averted from the viewer in a gesture that has been interpreted in different ways, perhaps suggesting the subject\u2019s aloofness, melancholic attitude, or otherworldliness. Moreover, the hairstyle frequently includes long, luxurious locks, often with complicated topknots that resemble the styles frequently worn by female deities as well as Apollo. Collectively, these features are thought to convey an air of androgyny that was appropriate to subjects who were recognized as exotic foreigners, including deities such as Bacchus (equivalent to the Greek Dionysos; see fig. 18.5), Cupid (Eros), Apollo, and the Egyptian Harpokrates, as well as mythological figures, such as Paris, Adonis, and Ganymede, and members of the Bacchic retinue, such as satyrs and fauns. Additionally, it was employed in representations of certain male personifications of Greek origin, such as Hypnos (Sleep), Thanatos (Death), and Pothos (Desire or Yearning). In this way, such youthful, languorous nudes were clearly distinguished from the genre of the heroic male nude, in which the mature, muscular body was employed to emphasize the subject\u2019s manliness, bravery, and physical prowess, as for example in the Art Institute\u2019s Fragment of a Portrait Statue of a Man (fig. 18.6).\n\nBased primarily on their poses, such statues are frequently thought to be based to varying degrees on now-missing Greek sculptures produced in the fourth century B.C. by master sculptors such as Praxiteles and Skopas, who are thought to have created the youthful statuary types depicting the Apollo Sauroktonos (Lizard Slayer) and Pothos, respectively (fig. 18.7). However, the question has been raised whether these statuary types were not created in the late classical period but were instead developed several centuries later in the late Hellenistic period. In particular, the effeminate forms and the notable, if not excessive, tilt of the body are thought to be atypical of the late fourth century B.C.\n\nDespite the lack of scholarly consensus regarding when this genre arose, it appears to have been popular in the Roman imperial period, particularly in the first and second centuries A.D. In the Roman context, such erotically charged statues likely served a predominantly decorative function, as suggested by the large number of extant examples of nude male youths, some of which were created as mirror reversals, while others appear to have been displayed in groups as pendants. Such figures were especially popular in domestic settings, where their distinctly Greek forms and nudity made them appropriate decoration for spaces intended for the cultural and intellectual pursuits associated with the elite Roman patron\u2019s engagement with otium. They were also employed in bath complexes, which housed various activities that were adopted from Greek culture, including bathing, exercising, and education, thus indicating their appeal to a wide audience.  \nKatharine A.

For a discussion of the statue of the Aphrodite of Knidos and its later Hellenistic and Roman versions, including the Roman version in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, see cat. 13, Statue of the Aphrodite of Knidos. On the statue of Apollo Sauroktonos attributed to Praxiteles, see Pliny, Natural History, 34.70; Martial Epigrams, 14.172; Stewart, Greek Sculpture, vol. 1, pp. 178\u201379, 278; Lambrinoudakis, Palagia, and Bruneau, \u201cApollon,\u201d p. 199, cat. 81, pl. 190; Simon, \u201cApollon/Apollo,\u201d pp. 378\u201379, cat. 53, pl. 302. For a bronze example of the type, see Apollo the Python-Slayer, Cleveland Museum of Art, 2004.30.a; see also Bennett, Praxiteles: The Cleveland Apollo. On the statue of Pothos attributed to Skopas, see Pliny, Natural History, 36.25; Stewart, Skopas of Paros, pp. 107\u201310, 111, 144\u201346, pls. 45a, c; Ba\u017eant, \u201cPothos I,\u201d pp. 502\u201303, cats. 12\u201326, pls. 395\u201396; Stewart, Greek Sculpture, vol. 1, pp. 184, 285, 286; Lattimore, \u201cSkopas and the Pothos.\u201d Some scholars believe that Praxiteles and Skopas might have been artistic rivals, as is suggested in the aforementioned passage of Pliny (Natural History, 36.25). However, Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway rightly pointed out that there is no definitive information about the style of either sculptor, and that their styles might have been more similar than is often assumed; see Ridgway, Fourth-Century Styles, pp. 253\u201354. On the Pothos as Skopas\u2019s \u201cmost Praxitelean of subjects,\u201d see Stewart, Greek Sculpture, vol. 1, p. 286.\n\nRidgway, Hellenistic Sculpture, vol. 1, pp. 87\u201388, 91; Ridgway, Fourth-Century Styles, p. 265.\n\nFor numerous examples found in the emperor Domitian\u2019s villa at Castel Gandolfo in Italy, which are likely of first-century date although not necessarily contemporary with the villa, see Newby, Greek Athletics in the Roman World, pp. 96\u2013106, 130\u201335, figs. 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 4.19, 4.20. Elizabeth Bartman suggested that the examples of this genre date largely to the second century A.D.; see Bartman, \u201cEros\u2019s Flame,\u201d p. 265.\n\nRidgway, Hellenistic Sculpture, vol. 1, pp. 87\u201388.

On sculptural pendants, see Bartman, \u201cSculptural Collecting and Display,\u201d pp. 79\u201382. Two Roman statues of Pothos now in the collection of the Musei Capitolini in Rome (MC 2416, attributed to the Claudian period, A.D. 41\u201354, and MC 2417, dated to c. A.D. 120\u201330, in the Hadrianic period) were found in a Roman townhouse under the Via Cavour, where they appear to have been displayed as pendants; see Bartman, \u201cDecor et Duplicatio.\u201d Similarly, two statues of the so-called Dresden Youth type that were found in the villa of the emperor Domitian at Castel Gandolfo, which bear some stylistic differences, might have functioned as pendants; see Newby, Greek Athletics in the Roman World, pp. 99, 101\u201302, figs. 4.5, 4.6.\n\nBartman, \u201cEros\u2019s Flame,\u201d p. 265.
