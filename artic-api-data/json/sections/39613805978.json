Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat. (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, 2013), pp. 195\u201398, 219, no. 3. Also see Salon d\u2019Automne, Salon d\u2019automne, exh. cat. (n.p., 1906), Oct. 6\u2013Nov. 15, 1906, cat. 154.\n\nWhen Durrio loaned his Gauguin collection to the 1928 Kunsthalle Basel exhibition on Gauguin (see Exhibition History), he received a deposit of 100,000 francs as a guarantee for the return of his collection. Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) appears in the inventories of Geiser (no. 86-106, Jan. 18, 1931, as Holzschnitte, and no. 68-89, Dec. 24, 1931, as Gravures sur bois, both listed as a set of woodcuts).

The collection was purchased in Basel after Durrio failed to return the cash deposit on the works loaned for the 1928 exhibition.
