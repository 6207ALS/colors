Clarke  \nRothman Family Curator  \nPrints and DrawingsSarah Kelly Oehler  \nField-McCormick Chair and Curator  \nArts of the AmericasWe are delighted to present Whistler Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago, the museum\u2019s fifteenth digital scholarly publication. This exploration of James McNeill Whistler\u2019s paintings and drawings follows on the heels of an extensive collaborative project between the Art Institute of Chicago, the University of Glasgow, and the Freer Gallery of Art to catalogue his etchings, the results of which were published online in 2012. The launch of the present digital publication also coincides with the imminent rerelease of the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, first published by the Art Institute in 1998 and soon to be reissued as a digital catalogue to ensure this crucial resource is available free of charge to scholars worldwide. We recognized that an in-depth study of the paintings and drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection would complement these earlier, print-focused publications, thus offering readers a fuller understanding of Whistler\u2019s work as seen through the museum\u2019s robust holdings. Generous support by the Lunder Foundation for the Lunder Consortium for Whistler Studies has made this work possible.\n\nThe nearly fifty paintings and drawings included in this catalogue span the full range of Whistler\u2019s career, from early drawings to late-career paintings. They also demonstrate his skill in a variety of media\u2014among them chalk, graphite, ink, oil paint, pastel, and watercolor\u2014and subject matter. The thirty-four catalogue entries enable the reader to understand the breadth of this versatile artist\u2019s production and how to situate each work within art history. Technical reports accompanying many of the entries afford scholars the opportunity to delve deeper into his materials and methods. Whistler famously declared in his \u201cTen O\u2019Clock Lecture\u201d (1885), \u201cNature contains the elements of color and form of all pictures\u2014as the keyboard contains the notes of all music\u2014but the artist is born to pick, and choose, and group with science, these elements, that the result may be beautiful.\u201d It seems only fitting that art historical study and conservation science should align in this catalogue to reveal a more comprehensive picture of Whistler\u2019s science of art.\n\nThe three essays in this publication further explore varying aspects of Whistler\u2019s art, science, and history. Sarah Kelly Oehler connects the surprising fact of Whistler\u2019s familial connections in Chicago to the early establishment of his reputation in the city. Stephanie L. Strother considers the sheer variety of Whistler\u2019s art, as seen through the lens of the museum\u2019s collection, to consider his art as a \u201csymphony with many notes.\u201d Finally, Kimberley Muir investigates the very foundations of his paintings, using the latest scientific techniques to illuminate how Whistler\u2019s choices of ground layers impacted the aesthetics of his art.\n\nThis catalogue also enables readers to examine Whistler\u2019s works on their own, through high-resolution photography that encourages close looking. Digital overlays of conservation imaging of the paintings further augment the catalogue\u2019s rich visual resources, providing insight into his working methods. We have included extensive comparative illustrations, a glossary of art historical and conservation terms, and links to references published online. This catalogue does not, however, feature exhibition and publication histories; recognizing that this research is never finished, the best repository for that information remains the individual object pages on the Art Institute\u2019s website.\n\nSince Whistler\u2019s lifetime, the artist and his works have been the subject of countless studies, including many produced by the Art Institute of Chicago. But it is our hope that with this digital catalogue\u2014a publication that addresses Whistler\u2019s art in terms both local and global, art historical and scientific\u2014we can reach a broader audience than ever before, inspiring them with the ability to see Whistler with new eyes.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">James McNeill Whistler, \u201cTen O\u2019Clock Lecture,\u201d in The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed.
