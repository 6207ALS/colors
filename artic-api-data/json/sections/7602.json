Among the works is this spare brush-and-ink drawing of his model Tati and a number of related images from the same time (see fig. 57.1, fig. 57.2, fig. 57.3, and fig. 57.4). Matisse drew her likeness in several long, fluid lines of black ink, which were applied to the sheet of paper with a flat, square brush, allowing us to trace the journey of his hand across the page as it moved from left to right swiftly, yet in a relaxed manner. There is little sign of hesitation in Matisse\u2019s recording of Tati except for where his brush paused before describing the sitter\u2019s lips, nose, eyebrows, and neck. The rest of her form is quite simple\u2014her neckline is only a curve with a sharp drop-off to represent her shoulder and her ear is a basic C shape with a squiggle denoting its many interior folds. Her head is adorned with a headband (or perhaps a braid wrapped across the top of her head), represented by a single, thick, wavy line.\n\nEach of the drawings of Tati from July 1947 is rendered on the same size of sheet; paired with the relaxed manner in which they were made, this suggests that they may all have been executed in one sitting. Little is known about the model, but a similar-looking girl with the same hairstyle appears on the right side of Matisse\u2019s painting Young Girls, Blue Window (fig. 57.5) from the same month.\n\nThe looser, free-flowing lines with which Matisse composed Tati\u2019s wavy hair and floral shirt highlight the luminosity present in such flat, black-and-white drawings. The ink in these areas is slightly transparent and the white from the page fluoresces through the black. Furthermore, the brightness of the paper is amplified by the contrast of the black ink. Indeed, in such brilliant black-and-white compositions, Matisse sought the same effect he had earlier attained in colored images in which he would juxtapose a bright blue or red with black paint. He identified this in the text of a 1949 exhibition catalogue of recent works, stating, \u201cI have noticed that drawings done with a brush and black ink contain, on a small scale, the same elements as a painting in color, that is to say, the differentiation of the quality of the surfaces in a unit of light. This becomes very obvious when the drawing is placed in shadow. The drawing generates light.\u201d Matisse viewed the white sheet of paper in his black ink drawings much like a vibrant red painted on canvas\u2014both the white sheet and the red paint appear brighter, thus generating more light, when placed in contrast with the color black. In the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, Matisse\u2019s use of the color goes beyond linear construction. As he did throughout his oeuvre, the artist used black here as an expressive element\u2014providing a construct of color where there appears to be none.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Choosing a flat, square brush approximately 1 cm wide, Henri Matisse took full advantage of the fluidity of the ink, sweeping his brush in broad, curving lines of deep black. The drawing is an economic assembly of curving and arcing brushstrokes. The artist chose the smoother side of the ivory wove sheet, which allowed for fluid strokes uninterrupted by surface texture. The sheet is well sized; this allowed the ink to flow across the surface without being absorbed into the paper laterally. It also allowed the paper to accept the fluid media without cockling. There are pinholes at the top corners indicating Matisse either pinned the paper to a board to draw upon or tacked the finished work to the wall, as was his habit.\n\nSigned and dated: H-Matisse Juill 47 (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 57.6).\n\nMatisse drew using a brush and black ink. The ink is glossy, indicating the presence of a resinous binder. Under ultraviolet light (254 nm) a resinous binder in the ink emits a whitish fluorescence visible from the verso of the sheet.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, smooth, ivory wove paper. There is a watermark in the lower left corner: Arches (1 \u00d7 3 cm) (see fig. 57.7).\n\nThe paper fibers are uniform in color and type. Transmitted light reveals them to be evenly distributed. There is a fine screen pattern on the verso (fig. 57.8), which is barely evident on the recto. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left have an imitation deckle edge, indicating that the paper is moldmade. The sheet dimensions are original.\n\n52.8 \u00d7 40.5 cm (20 3/4 \u00d7 16 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition. A fine network of cracks is evident in the densest passages of ink when viewed under magnification 80\u00d7. There is residual adhesive at all corners on the verso from previous hinges. Paper fibers from old hinges are embedded in the residual adhesive at the top and bottom of the left edge of the verso. The adhesive remnants on the verso create draws and distortions evident in raking light.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Rue Winterbotham Shaw (Nov. 18, 1905\u2013Jan. 29, 1979), Chicago, by Jan. 29, 1979.\n\nEstate of Rue Winterbotham Shaw, Chicago, Jan. 29, 1979\u2013May 14, 1979.\n\nBequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago, May 14, 1979.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Number  \nLocation: lower right  \nMethod: graphite  \nContent: dim: 40,4 \u00d7 52.5 [in a box] (fig. 57.9)\n\nInscription  \nLocation: center lower edge  \nMethod: graphite  \nContent: M I S S (fig. 57.10)\n\nInscription  \nLocation: lower left corner  \nMethod: graphite  \nContent: ph (fig. 57.11)\n\nThe media and their application, as well as the condition of the artwork, were assessed through visual examination using normal, transmitted, and raking light; microscope magnification (80\u2013300\u00d7); and ultraviolet-light examination (254 and 365 nm).
