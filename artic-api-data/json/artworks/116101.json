The artist probably painted these oil sketches while living in Italy between 1770 and 1778. Both images were engraved as illustrations for Johann Caspar Lavater\u2019s influential book on physiognomy, a popular pseudoscience that assessed an individual\u2019s character based on their outward appearance. According to that text, the heads were inspired by the damned souls in Italian poet Dante Alighieri\u2019s epic <em>Inferno</em>.</p>\n",
