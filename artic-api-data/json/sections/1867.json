(max.)  \nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in pen and brown ink)  \nInscribed: collection Leo Stein (tertiary support, lower right, in pen and black ink); Encadrer de facon a pas montrer du blanc autour (tertiary support, upper right margin, in graphite)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mr. Joel Starrels, 1961.1188\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse made this drawing using a reed pen and black ink on cream wove paper, with no preliminary marks to guide the placement of the boat. The square-shaped ends of the pen strokes are characteristic of a blunt-cut reed nib (see fig. 6.1). In the lighter strokes, such as in the interior of the sail, the nib split and left faint parallel lines as the pen ran out of ink. These lighter lines are mottled rather than fluid due to the fact that a reed nib skips along the high points of a paper\u2019s grain, leaving fluid lines when the pen is full and lines with jagged edges (sometimes only visible under magnification) as it runs out of ink (see fig. 6.2).\n\nMatisse is known to have drawn with reeds he collected himself in the South of France. He cut his pens from the dry, hollow reed shafts. Due to the width and fibrous nature of the reed wall, reeds are best suited for cutting wider points and blunt, square-cut nibs. Reed pens only produce short strokes, as they have no channel or reservoir to hold a quantity of ink.\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (fig. 6.3); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. Under magnification 80\u00d7 it can be seen that the ink on the far left does not extend onto the cut edge, indicating that the sheet was trimmed after Matisse finished the composition, likely in preparation for mounting. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, buff color and makes another contrasting 2\u20132.5 cm border. Other drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection with similar mounts have an impressed plate mark in the tertiary support; it is likely that such a mark was trimmed away here. Dry mount tissue is evident at the edges of the primary and secondary sheets under magnification 80\u00d7.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in pen and brown ink) (fig. 6.4).\n\nMatisse drew using reed pen and black ink. The ink appears rich, black, and glossy in the densest pen strokes and gray and translucent in more dilute applications. The gloss implies the presence of a resinous binder. The glossy appearance is enhanced when the surface is viewed at an angle.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper. The edges are straight cut. The sheet was trimmed after the drawing was completed. There is a partial impressed watermark along the top edge: MANUF<sup>RE</sup> CANSON &amp; MONTGOLFIER VIDALON LES (0.7 \u00d7 31.7 cm) (see fig. 6.5). The full watermark for this paper type reads: CANSON &amp; MONTGOLFIER VIDALON-LES-ANNONAY ANC<sup>NE</sup> MANUF<sup>RE</sup>.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, buff wove paper. The edges are unevenly trimmed. On the verso (fig. 6.6), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light.\n\nPrimary support: 44.4 \u00d7 31.7 cm (17 1/2 \u00d7 12 1/2 in.); secondary support: 46.4 \u00d7 33.7 cm (18 1/4 \u00d7 13 1/4 in.); tertiary support: 51.7 \u00d7 37.7 cm (20 1/4 \u00d7 15 in.) (max.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2014\u201315. Surface soil was reduced from the recto and verso. Hinges and multiple types of tape were removed from the edges on the verso. Edge tears were repaired with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste. A loss in the lower right corner was filled with toned Western paper. It was determined that the extensive foxing stains throughout could not be reduced given the limitations imposed by the dry mount adhesive present between the paper layers.\n\nUnder magnification 250\u00d7 a fine network of cracks is visible in some ink passages. The cracked ink is securely affixed to the paper. The primary support has scattered foxing spots along the edges and stray black marks near the center of the top and right edges.\n\nThe secondary support is foxed, particularly along the right and bottom edges.\n\nThe tertiary support is severely foxed overall. There is a crease across the lower right corner through the inscription. There is a 2 cm crease with broken and soiled surface fibers extending up from the lower left corner. There is a 2 cm tear at the center of the bottom edge and another at the right edge, 16.5 cm from the top; these have been repaired with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste. A 1 cm loss from the lower right corner has been filled with toned paper. The edges of the tertiary support have been trimmed on all sides, leaving the margins uneven.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Leo Stein (May 11, 1872\u2013July 29, 1947), Paris and Settignano, Italy, probably after Oct. 1905.\n\nC\u00e9sar Mange de Hauke (Mar. 8, 1900\u2013June 15, 1965), Paris, by May 11, 1954\u2013at least Apr. 22, 1956.

Watrous does not specify when the two artists began this practice. Pierre Matisse reported that they may have been influenced by the letters of Vincent van Gogh, in which he praised the reeds of southern France for drawing; see Watrous, Craft of Old-Master Drawings, p. 56n18. Yet very few of Van Gogh\u2019s letters were published prior to 1914, so their influence on the choice of reed pens for this drawing is unclear. Jo van Gogh-Bonger, ed., Vincent van Gogh: Brieven aan zijn broeder (Mij. voor Goede en Goedkoope Lectuur, 1914).\n\nFor a thorough discussion of reed pens see Watrous, Craft of Old-Master Drawings, pp. 52\u201359.\n\nThis is one of nine Matisse drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection on similar mounts: Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back (1900/01; cat. 1), Nude in Profile (1903\u201304; cat. 4), Boats (1905; cat. 5), Grounded Fishing Boat (1905; cat. 6), Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907; cat. 12), Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool (1910; cat. 13), Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back (c. 1908; cat. 15), Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with Sketch of a Foot (Aug. 1909; cat. 16), and Girl with a Cat (1910; cat. 17).
