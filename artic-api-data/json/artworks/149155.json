Welch chased Word, pulled her from her car, and beat her for nearly half an hour. More than forty people, some of whom had cellular phones, watched as Welch struck her repeatedly with a tire iron, but no one called the police. Word leapt from this bridge to escape her attacker. Two men jumped in the river to save her, but Word feared they would harm her as well and kept swimming; she eventually drowned. Martell Welch has been charged with murder.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
