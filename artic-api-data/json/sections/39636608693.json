Here it is likely that the male figure is a self-portrait in profile of the artist himself. Other such self-depictions are discernible by the emphasis that the artist places on his aquiline nose and pointed chin (e.g., fig. 121.2 [cat. 116] and fig. 121.3). He is silhouetted by a simplified version of the winged lizard that appears behind the female nude in Nave nave fenua (cat. 56). Gauguin used a small piece of coarsely grained wood to carve this image. As in his Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105), this piece of wood likely derived from an indigenous source that Gauguin himself prepared for carving and printing.\n\nThis print was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues of Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints, none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThe block was inked in black ink that contained a significant amount of binder. This is represented by faint halos around the printed lines and the reticulated pattern of ink deposition. These characteristics are most indicative of an oil such as linseed that was added to the ink to obtain the desired viscosity and working properties.\n\nThe paper is a poor quality, machine-made wove paper. It was hand torn along the top edge. The long horizontal format suggests that a larger sheet was used to print multiple blocks at the same time, after which it was separated into several hand-torn sections. This format is alluded to on page 186 of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa\u2014Voyage de Tahiti. Gauguin adhered an impression of this print onto a page that also contains At the Black Rocks (cat. 91) and Two Women Chattering (fig. 121.4 [cat. 113]). Thissuggests that they held particular significance for him; in addition, the vertical stacking of three images may well point to the artist\u2019s method of printing several blocks concurrently on this type of paper.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication, the print was conserved to reduce discoloration and structurally stabilize the work. Over time, the paper had become quite golden yellow in tone. Additionally, severe discoloration along the left and right edges occurred due to contact with acidic materials. Successful conservation intervention resulted in a more even sheet tone overall.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
