    "description": "<p>Educated at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Yale University, Tigerman (1930-2019) began his career in several important Chicago architectural firms, including Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and Harry Weese. In the 1970s he spearheaded the \u201cChicago 7,\u201d a small group of young architects who rebelled against Miesian modernism. In private practice, Tigerman has become known for anti-establishment humor and surprise in his designs. Influential in the academic community, he first served as director of the School of Architecture at University of Illinois-Chicago and then as founder of his own school, Archeworks. Tigerman has also been an active author, critic, and curator across a broad range of subjects. The Ryerson &amp; Burnham Archives has received the first shipment of his corporate papers and will receive the entire collection over a period of several years. The collection include project files, professional correspondence, project photographs, academic papers, including lecture notes and committee reports, manuscripts for lectures, and published and unpublished writings.</p>\n<p>Related information can be found in the <a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Tigerman,%20Stanley,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Tigerman McCurry Archive</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Tigerman,%20Stanley,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Tigerman,%20Stanley,%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Tigerman,%20Stanley/field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Stanley Tigerman Oral History.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
