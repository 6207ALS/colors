    "description": "<p>Goldberg\u2019s designs for hospitals demonstrate an incredible shift in scale\u2014from the simple geometric volumes of his 1963 Elgin State Hospital to the Health Sciences Center (HSC), three massive buildings designed from 1965 for a medical school, appliedscience laboratories, and a hospital elevated above a seven-story base. Many of the drawings for HSC function as diagrams that visualize the relationship between the building and the functional organization of the diverse programs housed within it, such as the research and patient-care \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and transportation networks within this \u201cHealth Science City.\u201d The high-tech quality of drawings for HSC, such as this axonometric projection of the complex, led to its publication in numerous architectural journals in the 1970s. This recognition further emphasized the relationship between the monumental volumes and complex systems of Goldberg\u2019s work and the contemporary international explosion of experimental cities, from megastructures to Archigram\u2019s Plug-in City.</p>\n",
