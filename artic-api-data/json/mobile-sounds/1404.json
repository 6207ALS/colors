    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This stout figure seems to depict a central Asian entertainer in the act of balancing something on his forehead. In fact, if you look from above you\u2019ll see that the forehead is pierced with a hold that would have supported a stick or pole now lost. Notice how realistically the artist described this figure\u2019s stance as he tries to keep the pole balanced. In the sixth century C.E. when this lively sculpture was made large areas of north China were occupied and divided by a succession of central Asian peoples. Artists and artisans were inspired by the ever changing panorama of unfamiliar faces they saw around them, diplomats, merchants, religious clerics and here entertainers. The craftsman whether a native Chinese or a foreigner working in China seems to have engaged in good natured exaggeration of foreign features. Neither the proportions of his body nor his features nor his clothes are Chinese. This figure was probably buried in the tomb of an official of a foreign court, undoubtedly to entertain the deceased in the afterlife. Large areas of China were often under non-Chinese rule. Invariably, the foreign rulers exposed China to outside influences. At the same time, most foreigners themselves gradually adopted Chinese customs, language and many styles of dress.</p>\n",
