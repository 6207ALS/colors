    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The theme of a woman before her mirror has a rich history. Its roots go back to renaissance images of the classical goddess, Venus admiring her own beauty. But this painting made by Berthe Morisot around 1880 is a more subtle and oblique interpretation of the theme. As a female artist she was much more restricted in her choice and treatment of subject matter than her male counterparts. Here, a woman undressing after a society ball is turned so that we see only the slightest glimpse of her profile, and she or perhaps the artist has positioned her mirror to discretely reflect only the crystal jar on her dressing stand and the flowers she may have worn in her hair. Her face remains tantalizingly out of view. Instead, we are invited to explore the creamy skin of her back revealed by her white cotton underdress, the fabric\u2019s soft folds are described with crisscross brushstrokes. If you look carefully you may also be able to see the headboard of her bed seemingly floating on top of the floral wallpaper.</p>\n",
