    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is a 6th Century Greek storage jar called an amphora, you see several of them in this case.  It's decorated with a scene from the story of the Twelve Labors of Herakles, which tested his strength and moral fiber.  In this particular episode, Herakles battles a lion who couldn't be killed by weapons, so the lion had to be wrestled to death.  Greek vase paintings are like snapshots from antiquity, they reveal or document the daily life of the Greeks, their rituals and in this case their mythology.  This is a particular style of vase painting called the black-figure style, the black figures and shapes are painted in silhouette over the natural reddish clay background.  Some such vases may reflect Greek monumental painting which unlike Greek architecture, sculpture and ceramic ware does not survive.  Vases like this one show clearly that Greek painters appreciated a sophisticated sense of line and the rhetoric of gesture and expression.  The Greeks used the same word poiesis for both the production of things such as images and pots and the writing of poetry.  And for them, the making of things or poems was synonymous with making things beautiful, that is with proportion, harmony, precision and reason.  And it was through vases like this one and the others around you since Greek wall and panel painting did not survive that painters of the Renaissance and of the Neoclassical period of the 18th Century learned of Greek painting.</p>\n",
