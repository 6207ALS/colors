    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Conservator at the Art Institute of Chicago, Rachel Sabino.</p>\n<p>Rachel: This teabowl we\u2019re looking at is really the apotheosis of what we consider Chinese porcelain. It is exceptionally thin, it is exceptionally finely potted. If you held it up to the light you\u2019d be able to see through it, such is its translucency.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Practicing ceramic artist, Michael Kaysen.<br>Michael: For a long time, Europeans didn\u2019t even know what porcelain itself was. And in fact, it\u2019s one of the first... &lt;chuckles&gt; it\u2019s one of the first-- earliest episodes of... industrial espionage. The Europeans were trying to figure out what the heck they were making these-- what kind of clay it was. How was this being done? And it was closely guarded by the Chinese, because that\u2019s what they were making their money on.</p>\n<p>Rachel: And it was at this time that the Europeans finally, finally cracked the recipe for porcelain. In Germany, Johann finally, with the patronage of Augustus I of Saxony, by the great fortune of finding a vein of kaolin in Meissen, was able to create porcelain. But it wasn't anywhere close to this, nowhere near as fine, nowhere near as pure. It was riddled with imperfections. In fact, you can go upstairs to the European Decorative Arts Galleries and see objects from the Meissen factory. It is white and it's very hard, it's very hard high fired, but nothing on the order of this brilliance and luminosity.</p>\n",
