    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: You\u2019re looking at the back of a solid bronze mirror. The reflective surface is on the other side. Here on the back, you see an engraved female figure with wings cradling the nude lifeless body of a warrior. This represents \u0112\u014ds goddess of the dawn holding her son Memnon, a causality of the Trojan War. This episode from Greek mythology had a strong appeal for the Etruscan people including the owner of this mirror. The Etruscan civilization flourished in central Italy particularly during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: What we see now is a sort of green/blue surface at one point was a very shiny bronze.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Curator Karen Manchester.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: They were masters of bronze working and they also had an intense interest in all things Greek and were quite interested in importing large number of works of art from Greece, in particular, Greek vases. What we have preserved is the bronze part of the mirror but it did once have an elaborate handle made in some other material that is now lost, perhaps ivory, bone of some sort, wood, some other material. But the tang that you see at the bottom once was a bit longer and it was inserted into this handle. Sometimes hand mirrors of this sort had a figure at the base that might have been on a stand itself so that the mirror could actually sit on something like the ancient version of a dressing table.&quot;</p>\n",
