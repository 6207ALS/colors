    "description": "<p>This print represents a complex tribute to the great Japanese haiku poet Takarai Kikaku (1661\u20131707) and his descendants. Kikaku was a close follower and student of the poet Bash\u00f4 (1644\u20131694) and started his own school of haiku poetry, which remained popular into the early 20th century.<br>This print is hosted by a descendant of Kikaku, Kikakudo Eiki (1823\u20131904), whose poem is presented at the bottom left. The 175 inscriptions were made by cultural figures and others who may have been Kikakudo\u2019s students. The print functions as a tribute to the original Kikaku by illustrating and describing an ink stone he owned. It also acts to legitimate Kikakudo, placing him in the context of his forefather and in central positions in the composition. Kikakudo further asserted his position in the cultural world by including the poet Yoda Hyakusen and the artist Shibata Zeshin in the creation of the print.</p>\n",
