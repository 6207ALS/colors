Ryerson Collection, 1933.1163\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Waterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect was executed on a pre-primed, no. 40 seascape (marine) standard-size linen canvas. A stamp, transcribed from the back of the original canvas, indicates that the canvas was purchased in London from the French supplier Lechertier Barbe Ltd. The off-white ground consists of two layers. The work appears to have been carried out in several sessions. There are no apparent alterations to the composition; because the painting was rather thickly built up in large areas, however, it is difficult to interpret the underlying paint layers. The paint surface consists of low-relief texture, often coming from earlier brushstrokes beneath the surface. The handling of the brushwork creates a somewhat uniform surface across much of the sky and the water. The bridge and the skyline were reduced to their basic forms; the only details depicted were the columns of the bridge and the crossing traffic. These elements were sketchily rendered with a few quick strokes, but they were painted with more intense colors\u2014including bright yellow and orange\u2014than in the rest of the painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 39.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1903 (lower right corner, in blue paint) (fig. 39.2). The underlying paint layers were dry when the painting was signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 100 cm. This corresponds to a no. 40 seascape (marine) standard-size canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 14.8V (0.3) \u00d7 14.8H (0.4) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is moderate cusping on the left and right edges of the canvas, and slight cusping along the top and bottom edges.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1991 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced 5\u20139 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Most tack holes spaced approximately 10\u201311 cm apart. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes on all sides. There are a few additional holes on the top and bottom edges. These probably relate to tacks added later to reinforce the edges.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher; dates to 1964 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1964-treatment stretcher was probably the original stretcher. A 1959 examination report describes it as a five-membered, keyable stretcher with a vertical crossbar. Depth: Not documented. Based on a second crease in the tacking margins, presumably where excess canvas was folded over the back edge of the stretcher, the original stretcher depth was approximately 2 cm.\n\nAlthough a stamp on the back of the original canvas (now obscured by the lining canvas was transcribed as \u201cBarber London, S.W.\u201d (fig. 39.3), the canvas was probably purchased from Lechertier Barbe Ltd. in London.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of the top, bottom, and right tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric on those edges. Unprimed canvas is visible along the left tacking edge; because of the presence of paper strips adhered to the edges, however, it is difficult to determine whether the ground originally stopped short of this edge or whether the ground has come away with the paper in the areas where the canvas is exposed (fig. 39.4). The canvas was probably commercially prepared. Analysis indicates that the ground consists of two layers. The lower layer ranges from approximately 20 to 90 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from approximately 15 to 65 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 39.5).\n\nWhen the painting is observed under a microscope, it can be seen that the ground has an off-white tone (fig. 39.6). Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the lower layer is more toned, containing black, red, and brown pigment particles (fig. 39.5).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of barium sulfate, silica, silicates, bone black, iron oxide brown, and a zinc compound. The upper layer contains lead white with minor amounts of calcium carbonate (chalk) and traces of barium sulfate, silica, silicates, and a zinc compound. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe work was built up directly from the initial lay-in with no apparent alterations to the composition as the painting progressed. The paint layers, however, are quite thickly built up\u2014the X-ray shows dense paint application over much of the surface, especially in the area of the bridge and the water (fig. 39.7)\u2014making it difficult to discern even the final compositional forms in the X-ray, far less any changes that may have occurred in earlier paint layers. The ground layer is completely covered by the buildup of paint, remaining visible only near the edges of the canvas (fig. 39.8).\n\nThe composition is dominated by pale-blue and pale-violet tones. The paint application consists largely of touches of discrete color, often built up over more broadly applied underlayers of pale bluish-gray in a somewhat sketchy manner with very little articulation of detail, creating a uniformity over the surface of the water and the sky. Architectural forms, such as the distant smokestacks and the columns and arches of the bridge, are cursorily indicated using slightly more-intense blue paint (fig. 39.9, fig. 39.10). In general, there are no distinct edges to these elements, causing them to visually dissolve into adjacent areas of the painting. The sunlight, coming from beyond the right edge of the painting, illuminates the side of the bridge, highlighting it and the traffic that travels along the top. The vehicles are executed using a few quick brushstrokes (fig. 39.11, fig. 39.12, fig. 39.13), with low impasto daubs of bright orange, red, and white\u2014among the most brilliant color used in the painting\u2014added as final touches (fig. 39.14, fig. 39.15).\n\nIn general, the paint seems to have had a rather viscous consistency, especially earlier layers that retain the crisp marks of the brush application (fig. 39.16). In fact, much of the low-relief surface texture is due to underlying brushstrokes whose texture remains evident even though the colors have been covered by subsequent brushwork (fig. 39.17). There is some wet-on-wet paint application but virtually no working or blending together of brushstrokes on the canvas. For the most part, the upper paint layers were built up in a network of individual strokes, carried out in several sessions, which allowed earlier layers to become surface dry before additional layers were applied on top. In a few places, broader, more-fluid paint applications were used; these sometimes allow the texture from beneath to show through and other times impart a relatively smooth, flat surface (fig. 39.18). In some areas of the painting, the artist likely worked back into the still-soft paint, either lightly scraping or wiping the surface to expose underlying layers in discrete areas. This is particularly evident in the cloud of pale-pink smoke in the left background of the composition (fig. 39.19). Here, some of the thinly applied pinkish paint has been lightly removed from the high points of the surface, revealing pale-greenish-gray layers from underneath (fig. 39.20). A few final touches, such as the bright-blue and pale-orange-red strokes in the sky, were lightly dragged across the surface (fig. 39.21, fig. 39.22).\n\nSmall inclusions underneath the paint surface, seen occasionally throughout the water and in the sky, have the appearance of dried paint, possibly picked up on the brush from the artists\u2019 palette (fig. 39.23). Ridges in the paint, seen in places on all four sides, were probably caused by framing of the work before the paint layers were dry (e.g. fig. 39.24).\n\nBrushes, including 0.5, 0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 cm width (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an even, slightly glossy, synthetic varnish layer. The 1959 examination report indicates that the painting was unvarnished at that time; this may have been the original surface.\n\nIn 1959, the back of the canvas was vacuumed, three missing keys were replaced, the corners of the canvas were restretched, the stretcher was keyed out slightly, and losses at the lower left and lower right corners were consolidated with wax-resin adhesive. Surface grime was removed, and a spray coat of L44/46 (Lucite: butyl methacrylate) was applied.\n\nIn 1964, the varnish and retouching applied in 1959 were removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched onto a new ICA spring stretcher. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Losses were inpainted. A final spray coat of AYAA was applied.\n\nIn 1999, an area on the back of the stretcher, where the original canvas had delaminated from the lining canvas, was readhered using a tacking iron. The lining canvas was then readhered to the stretcher back.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. There is some deterioration of the canvas, and abrasion and loss of the ground layer, on the tacking edges. There are old paper and adhesive residues on the tacking edges. Ridges in the paint layers seen along all four edges are probably related to framing when the paint was still soft. There are localized damages in the paint layer around the lower left and lower right corners, and small losses along some of the original foldovers. Associated retouching in these areas is slightly mismatched but unobtrusive. Thin layers of retouching are especially noticeable along the right edge, where more of the ground layer from the original tacking edge was incorporated into the picture plane when the painting was restretched after lining; this is mostly concealed by the frame. Microscopic examination revealed some traces of old retouching in the pale-pink smoke cloud on the left side of the sky. Cracking is minimal and where present is very fine; where it is visible to the naked eye, cracking is concentrated in areas where the paint is thickly layered, for example, on the left side of the bridge and left of the central tower. The painting has an even, semiglossy, synthetic varnish layer.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches with cabochon centers on a quadrillage bed, leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding, and an independent fillet liner. The frame has both water and oil gilding. Ornament on the ogee face and sight molding have been selectively burnished; the liner has been left matte. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the ogee face and ornament, the sight molding, and the scotia sides. Red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. The frame has an overall raw umber tone, on top of which casein or gouache gray washes and dark flecking were applied. The glued poplar substrate is mitered and nailed. Half-lap corner and center braces were glued and nailed between the perimeter and interior back edge boards. This frame illustrates the original Durand-Ruel construction. Over this wood molding a cast plaster face was applied. At a later date a partial back frame was attached with screws. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized, running undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 39.25).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 11, 1904, for 9,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Dec. 14, 1904 or Jan. 6, 1905.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to W.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that was given to the painting when it was first exhibited in 1904 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, in the exhibition titled Monet, Vues de la Tamise \u00e0 Londres. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nMay 9, 1904: Effet de Soleil. 1903, under the heading Waterloo Bridge (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Claude Monet: Vues de la Tamise \u00e0 Londres, exh. cat.

The same title is listed on a purchase receipt on Durand-Ruel letterhead, also dated February 10, 1914, photocopy in curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the signature contains cobalt blue; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrSun\\_33\\_1163\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1163\\_Monet\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 6, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the measured dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching the painting on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Waterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect (W1586/1933.1163),\u201d Dec. 2011.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Jan. 3, 1964, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. No evidence was found of a supplier named Barber operating in London in this period; however, Lechertier, Barbe &amp; Cie., a French company with a London branch, was active in London during Monet\u2019s stays there (see www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/directory-of-suppliers/l.php). Further evidence of Monet\u2019s use of canvases from this company is suggested in a letter that he wrote to Alice Hosched\u00e9 from London on March 18, 1900, in which he stated, \u201cYou see it\u2019s not passion that I lack, since I have something like 65 canvases covered with paint and I would take more, this country is not ordinary; so I am going to order some canvases. What a bill I\u2019m going to have at Lechertier!\u201d [Tu vois que ce n\u2019est pas l\u2019ardeur qui me manque, puisque j\u2019ai quelque chose comme 65 toiles couvertes de couleurset qu\u2019il m\u2019en faudrait plus, ce pays n\u2019\u00e9tant pas ordinaire; aussi vais-je recommander des toiles. Quelle note je vais avoir chez Lechertier!]. Original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 4, Nos. 1596\u20131983 et les grandes d\u00e9corations (Taschen; Wildenstein Institute, 1996); translated by the author. It is possible that the canvas stamp was only partially legible when it was transcribed in 1964, resulting in an error in transcription.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles in both layers and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The upper ground layer has regions of almost pure lead white. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1163\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 6, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrSun\\_33\\_1163\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nNo evidence of tool marks was observed.\n\nUnder magnification, traces of retouching were observed in areas of lighter paint, which seems to indicate that the exposed lighter underlayers were, in a previous restoration, interpreted as damage (i.e. abrasion) to the original paint surface.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. XRF analysis also detected traces of zinc in several spectra but further analysis would be required to determine the source of the zinc. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1163\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 6, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1163\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 30, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrSun\\_33\\_1163\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

In the current examination it was difficult to discern whether there were actual tears in the canvas, or whether the damage was contained in the paint and ground layers.\n\nKirk Vuillemot, \u201cMonet Frame Descriptions Final,\u201d Dec. 3, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe transaction is recorded in the Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1901\u201313 (no. 7641, as La Tamise \u00e0 Londres, Waterloo Bridge, effet de soleil, 1903): \u201cPurchased from Monet by DR Paris on 11 May 1904 for 9 000 F/ Stock DR Paris no. 7641; photo Druet [sic] no. 21 / (No. 18 of the exhibition),\u201d as confirmed by Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 21, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe Paris and New York Durand-Ruel stock books record different dates for the sale.
