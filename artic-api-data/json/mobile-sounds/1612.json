    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: By the mid 1880s, Monet had largely stopped making paintings of urban life in Paris. Instead, he immersed himself in the challenges of depicting the French landscape. He began using more acidic purples, mauves and pinks, in contrast to his earlier blue green palette. Monet arrived in the little fishing village of Etretat on the Normandy coast in the fall of 1895. He hoped to paint its towering dramatic cliffs without the summer clouds, but the stormy weather confined him to his hotel. Looking down from the top floor window of his hotel bedroom Monet began working on a series of canvases featuring the beach, with its fishing boats and sheds. In this version the weather has calmed enough to allow the fisherman to put out to sea. Beneath the leaden sky that speaks of the recent downpour their brightly painted boats with dark sails set off toward the horizon. On the beach itself, which glistens with wetness are three dark structures with steeply pitch tarred roofs. These are old fishing boats, now used for storage. Their landlocked forms contrast strikingly with the small, vulnerable boats out at sea, which must nevertheless go out daily to sustain the community.</p>\n",
