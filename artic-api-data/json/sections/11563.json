He began with the traditional method of drawing on lithographic stone but progressively favored a newer method that involved the use of transfer paper. In transfer lithography, the artist creates an image in lithographic crayon or ink on specially coated paper that is then transferred to a lithographic stone for printing. One advantage of this technique for Whistler was that it enabled freer experimentation; unlike lithographic stones, which were heavy, expensive, and required time and specialized skill to prepare, sheets of transfer paper were portable, comparatively cheap, and acquired ready-made. This made them better suited to sketching, as unsatisfactory attempts could be easily discarded.\n\nTwo Sketches, one of the artist\u2019s earliest efforts with transfer paper, appears to be the product of just this kind of loose experimentation. Whistler utilized two types of lithographic crayon for his two figures\u2013\u2013a hard crayon for the drawing of the man and a softer, greasier crayon for that of the woman. In both cases he filled in the summary outlines of the forms with rough diagonal shading, handling the crayons much as he would other drawing media. He used brush and tusche (a greasy lithographic ink) for the woman\u2019s hat and collar, extending his technical explorations on the paper to include a method more akin to painting. By varying his materials between the figures, Whistler arrived at a useful comparison of their visual effects: the line produced by the hard crayon is lighter and allows for greater control in the shading and detail of the man\u2019s face, whereas the combination of greasy crayon and tusche for the female figure creates richer, velvety textures and a darker, more dramatic range of shades that Whistler exploited to differentiate the details of her costume. For the woman, Whistler relied on materials and techniques he had previously employed on lithographic stones. Those used for the man more closely correspond to the artist\u2019s later efforts with transfer paper. In this way, Two Sketches at once reflects familiar approaches and anticipates new stylistic developments.\n\nThe process of transferring an image from paper to stone necessitates the paper\u2019s destruction, and therefore any surviving example such as Two Sketches exists because it was not ultimately made into a print. Whistler probably never intended the studies on this sheet to be anything other than informal experiments with the variations of lithographic media. Indeed, Thomas R. Way (the son of Thomas Way, who worked closely with both his father and Whistler) judged the work to be a possible \u201ctrial of transfer paper,\u201d listing it as such in the second edition of his catalogue of Whistler\u2019s lithographs after spotting it at the artist\u2019s memorial exhibition in London in 1905. At the London memorial show, the sheet was featured among examples of Whistler\u2019s printed lithographs. Way\u2019s decision to catalogue it in his volume, published later that year, indicates that he too may have believed it to be a printed lithographic impression rather than a lithographic drawing on transfer paper, although his ambiguous language leaves the matter open-ended. This confusion as to whether the work was an untransferred drawing or a transferred print persisted until well into the twentieth century, highlighting the sometimes considerable difficulty in distinguishing between the two.\n\nWay identified the male figure as a possible portrait of Charles Augustus Howell, the notorious Anglo-Portuguese art collector, dealer, and adviser who was a close associate of Whistler\u2019s in the late 1870s. He assisted Whistler in times of financial difficulty (often profiting personally in the process) and helped the American artist raise much-needed funds in 1878\u201379 during the time of his falling-out with patron Frederick Leyland, the libel suit against John Ruskin, and subsequent bankruptcy. Modern scholars have tended to agree with Way\u2019s identification, based partly on existing photographs of Howell (see fig. 19.1). The female figure has not been conclusively identified. The woman who most frequently modeled for Whistler in the late 1870s was his companion at the time, Maud Franklin; however, the features of the woman in the sketch are too summarily drawn to make a reliable match. Howell is shown at a closer range than his female counterpart; this variable viewing distance, coupled with the lack of a clear spatial relationship between the two figures, indicates that Whistler probably drew them separately and contributes to the sketches\u2019 sense of informality.\n\nDespite the elder Way\u2019s encouragement, Whistler abandoned lithography soon after making this sketch and did not return to it for several years. Although he did complete a small number of lithographs during this early period, he would not fully move out of the preliminary experimental phase registered in Two Sketches until the late 1880s.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Two Sketches corresponds to Margaret F.

It is also reflected in the drawing\u2019s entry in Stratis and Tedeschi, The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, 1:500\u2013502 (cat. I).\n\nHarriet K.

(London: George Bell and Sons; New York: H. Wunderlich, 1905), 63 (cat. 160). Way was apparently unaware of the work\u2019s existence until he saw it at the 1905 memorial exhibition, for it is not included in the first edition of his catalogue raisonn\u00e9, published in 1896. See also International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, Memorial Exhibition of the Works of J. McNeill Whistler, exh. cat. (London: International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers, 1905), 60 (cat. 148).\n\nThe work was listed as a lithograph in sale and exhibition catalogues through at least 1967. Margaret MacDonald identified the sheet, at that time untraced, as most likely an untransferred drawing on transfer paper in MacDonald (1995), 246 (cat. 677). This was confirmed when the drawing was located and subsequently published in 1998 in Stratis and Tedeschi, The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, 1:500\u2013502 (cat. I).\n\nSee, for example, Britt Salvesen, Harriet K.
