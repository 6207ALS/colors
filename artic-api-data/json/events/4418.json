    "description": "<p><br><strong>The Lives of Spiritual Things</strong></p><p>The recent fire at Notre Dame in Paris sent shock waves around the world because of the historical, cultural, and often personal significance that the site held. In the wake of efforts to rebuild it, join educators Matt Ford and Nenette Luarca-Shoaf to reflect on the ways that spiritual meaning evolves as objects change hands or contexts over the course of their histories.<br><br>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s globe-spanning collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Facilitators select featured artworks, which they will post here in advance of each discussion. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art.</p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
