    "description": "<p><em>Untitled</em> effectively embodies its maker\u2019s goal of melding Eastern calligraphy and Western drawing. Mark Tobey studied brushwork in China and Japan, where he lived for a while in a Zen monastery. Around 1935 Tobey arrived at his distinctive \u201cwhite writing,\u201d or intricate networks of calligraphic marks that densely and evenly animate a surface. When viewed from a distance, these dabs and dashes of pigment interspersed with short, overlapping lines\u2014create a writhing, unified field of energy. In <em>Untitled</em> the subdued palette of lavender, white, gray, black, and burgundy functions similarly\u2014the innumerable strokes and marks only become distinct from close-up. A smoothly painted border, which appears in much of Tobey\u2019s oeuvre, surrounds and offsets the vibrating center. The artist felt that his delicate, teeming webs of \u201cliving line\u201d mirrored the connections between East and West, finite and infinite, humanity and the cosmos.</p>\n",
