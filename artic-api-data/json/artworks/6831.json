    "description": "<p>This painting depicts a young Saint John the Baptist living as a hermit in the wilderness. His cross of reeds, pointing gesture, and the nearby lamb refer to his role as a prophet foretelling the coming of Christ, the so-called \u201clamb of God,\u201d in the New Testament.</p>\n<p>Previously attributed to an unknown Sevillian artist, this painting has recently been recognized as the work of a young Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. The treatment of the saint is more idealized than figures in Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s earliest work, suggesting that it may have been made after his brief visit to Madrid in 1622, where Italian paintings in the royal collection exposed him to new ways of depicting the human figure.</p>\n",
