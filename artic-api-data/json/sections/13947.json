Yet Albright considered That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door) (hereafter The Door [fig. 1; cat. 13]) one of his most important works, a signature piece that took ten laborious years to complete (1931/41). To be sure, audiences find this funereal painting fascinating but at the same time considerably more cryptic than more easily relatable paintings like Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (cat. 7), in which a raddled woman in a dark, dilapidated room contemplates her mortality.\n\nEight feet tall, The Door (cat. 13) literally looms over the beholder. With its two eyelike roundels, it has an uncannily lifelike presence. Because Albright painted every detail from multiple and often impossibly conflicting angles, it seems to breathe, bulge, and pulsate; each element is off-square and off-plumb. Although the actual paint is so smooth that not a single brushstroke can be made out, the dingy grayish-brown surface appears scaly, scratched, dented, and pockmarked. As Art Institute director Daniel Catton Rich put it, the \u201cdetails swarm like ants,\u201d and the very pigment seems to be a mix of \u201ccobwebs, dried spittle, and dust.\u201d Intricate carvings ornament the doorframe, which casts a dense black shadow from the right. Midway up hangs an enormous funeral wreath of calla lilies, roses, and lilies of the valley. It is embellished with a pink net bow, its streamers drooping listlessly. One of the roses has fallen onto the marble doorstep along with a few sprigs of greenery. The Eastlake-style door knob and doorplate are encrusted with schematic patterns, and the doorplate has a double keyhole with a swinging cover. From the lower keyhole protrudes a brass key; from the upper drifts a faint wisp of blue vapor (see fig. 2). Finally, on the left a puffy, wrinkled hand, wearing a heavily worked silver ring and holding an exquisitely rendered lace handkerchief, is poised to reach down and turn the key.\n\nAlbright was perfectly candid about how he made The Door though less forthcoming when it came to why. But his detailed accounts of the process by which he sought and assembled all the elements of the painting contain plenty of clues that encourage us to explore the painting\u2019s conceptual genesis and root it in the cultural, social, and material circumstances of the day, or rather, the decade of its making.\n\nIn a 1972 interview, Paul Cummings asked the artist how he had accumulated all the objects he used in his painting. Albright said that the doorstep was a tombstone he\u2019d gotten for thirty-five cents in Warrenville, Illinois (where he lived and worked, along with his father and his identical twin, Malvin). The beat-up brass threshold came from a junkyard, as did the door itself. Albright specified that he wanted an old door that \u201clooked kind of drab like an Ad[d]ams [that is, the ghastly Addams Family mansion] or from a ghost house, one that would have a little character in itself, that had been painted and had started to fade.\u201d The doorjamb\u2019s decorative moldings came from another dismantled house. Albright claimed that he had purchased the wax funeral wreath from a florist friend. Because such arrangements were not made to last, the artist had to replace it three or four times over the years. The brass key was from the door of his old studio; the lace handkerchief\u2014once white, now dyed blue\u2014was his mother\u2019s, inherited from her grandmother. There was a human model, too: a girl with small hands. Over time, she (and her hand) tired of posing, and Albright substituted a plaster cast. Characteristically, though, he aged it until it bore no resemblance whatsoever to the hand of a young woman. One wonders why he didn\u2019t simply find an older person to model, but then again, the joy lay in the power to foreshadow and painstakingly map the ultimate way of all flesh. As a macabre finishing touch, Albright edged the painting with a black-velvet coffin lining that he had bought from a casket company and, surrounding that, a wood frame carved with writhing nudes in silverleaf and set with handles on either side. It was a door and a coffin all at once.\n\nFinding the all-too-literal frame a distraction for audiences, Albright eventually replaced it with a conventional one. Alas, the original frame disappeared, and no photographs of it have been found. But photographs of the real door in Albright\u2019s studio (see fig. 3) suggest how much the artist did to transmogrify the various junky components. The actual door is static and flat, its surface scuffed and worn. Compared to the finished work, it is just a blank. But in the painting, Albright gave that blank slab of wood uncanny life, even though\u2014ironically\u2014it was all about death.\n\nAlbright\u2019s fascination with death had deep roots. During his World War I army service as a medical draftsman in Nantes, France, he produced three sketchbooks documenting gruesome battle wounds. Although Albright scholars have made much of that experience as a formative influence, the artist himself made light of it, later insisting (perhaps disingenuously) that it had made little or no impact on his fascination with disintegration and mortality. Whatever the case, there was another and equally pertinent influence much closer to home: the artist\u2019s father, Adam Emory Albright, who made his living as a painter of pastoral scenes populated by farm boys as sunny and wholesome as his son\u2019s mottled human wrecks were dark and unnerving. Adam had trained at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts with Thomas Eakins, notorious for a pedagogy that included hands-on dissection in his courses on human anatomy. Adam was put in charge of managing the logistics of the dissection component, and in his memoirs he recounted with evident relish many a grisly episode. The so-called pickles (i.e., cadavers) were stored in a tank accessed by a trapdoor in the dissecting room, which the students dubbed \u201cthe morgue.\u201d After the class had picked the corpses to pieces, a janitor burned the body parts in the basement. Sometimes students would take home a limb or a head for study. The woman who looked after Adam\u2019s room was (hardly surprisingly) \u201cshocked and frightened\u201d one time when she found an arm and a hand on his windowsill. Such were the tales that Adam later recounted to his boys: \u201cAs the cadaver was carried from the dissecting room to the lecture hall,\u201d he recalled, \u201cthe men\u2019s life class accompanied it in a body, chanting a dirge. When my twins were little fellows, I used to tell them about these funeral processions as a bedtime story, and chant the dead march to put them to sleep.\u201d He added, tongue not quite in cheek, that such stories might explain the \u201cmorbid slant of Ivan\u2019s genius.\u201d\n\nThese gruesome yarns made a deep impression on little Ivan and surely helped set him upon the path that led to his artistic fascination with ruin and decay. In public and in conversation, Ivan often launched into lengthy disquisitions on light, color, optical perception, and motion, but at bottom he always had mortality on his mind. In 1931, the year he devoted to collecting junk and beginning to render an elaborate charcoal underdrawing of The Door, he had started work as well on Showcase Doll (which he also called Dead Doll; fig. 4 [cat. 12]). Initially, he tried to divide his time between both projects, but in the end he committed himself to The Door and left Showcase Doll unfinished. Albright scholar Michael Croydon proposed that Showcase Doll took its form from so-called graveyard dolls: waxen effigies fashioned in the likeness of a dead child and usually placed at the graveside in a little glass-topped coffin. But Albright\u2019s doll was not meant to be one of those, even though he had a glass case made to contain it \u201cas if it were in a store with the doll and lace and different stuff all around, not like dolls.\u201d\n\nIt is not easy to parse that last phrase, but Albright probably meant that his doll was not an ordinary plaything. In toy shops and department stores, dolls were generally displayed en masse, often in rows, as if for a class photograph. They certainly weren\u2019t sealed up in glass coffins. Rather than a child\u2019s toy or graveyard effigy, in fact, the doll in Albright\u2019s unfinished painting is a so-called boudoir doll, made for adult women to use as a decorative accent for a bed or, as the name implies, feminine sitting room (see fig. 5). Enormously popular in the 1920s, boudoir dolls\u2014like Albright\u2019s\u2014had large, staring eyes, strongly marked arched brows, and tiny pursed red lips. They wore extravagant outfits of satin, net, and lace. Never meant to stand, they had soft tubular legs capped with high-heeled shoes. Because the legs were floppy, these shoes tended to point in the same direction when the doll was sprawled out on a bed or sofa. Albright depicts them this way in the painting: aligned in parallel, as if they were two left feet.\n\nAlbright\u2019s doll is a miniature effigy of a grown woman, a dead woman, stretched out on a satin pillow, arms flung over her head. In her little coffin are cosmetic accessories, including a Victorian syringe, presumably for perfume. Whatever or whoever was on the artist\u2019s mind we do not know, though we can at least guess. Albright\u2019s poetry, which he wrote\u2014prolifically\u2014up to the time of his marriage in 1946, reveals an abiding fascination with love and death\u2014beautiful and romantic or sordid and disgusting. One of the many poems along those lines could almost be the dead doll\u2019s epitaph: \u201cIn a room / I saw her / covered with roses / In a long room / I first saw her / In a coffin she lay / In a dress of satin white / Her head against a pillow placed.\u201d The artist might have been channeling Edgar Allan Poe, who famously pronounced that \u201cthe death . . . of a beautiful woman\u201d is the \u201cmost poetical topic in the world.\u201d Others dwell bitterly on some romantic rejection so harsh that<font face=\"arial\"> in one poem Albright describes it as leaving him</font> \u201conly a body without a soul / On the altar of unreturned love O Ida.\u201d In another, the anguished suitor drinks poison, sits in a coffin playing with death flowers, and laments the \u201csickly death\u201d that the nameless \u201cshe\u201d has made of his life. Disappointment in love\u2014however much a fantasy it may have been, as with his crush on the married Ida Rogers, who modeled for Into the World Came a Soul Called Ida\u2014may well have been the genesis of both Showcase Doll and The Door, the one a death wish upon the heartless beloved, the other a pictorial elegy for the lover\u2019s ruined dreams and dead soul.\n\nBut how did Albright come up with the idea of a door hung with a funeral wreath in the first place? Albright scholar Robert Cozzolino has persuasively made the case for a religious interpretation, and indeed, the artist much later suggested that the work had such connotations and that Christ had come to mind while he was painting the roses in the wreath. Cozzolino suggests that we might look to William Holman Hunt\u2019s The Light of the World (1853; Keble College, Oxford University) as one plausible source for Albright\u2019s painting. A nocturnal scene, it depicts Christ knocking on a weed-choked door\u2014the door of the soul. This door has no knob or key: it can only be opened from the inside. The soul within slumbers insensate in the dark. Only if it opens the moldering door to the light of Christ will it attain salvation. Even the title, Cozzolino maintains, seems to be a spin-off of a general confession in the Book of Common Prayer: \u201cWe have left undone those things which we ought to have done; and we have done those things which we ought not to have done.\u201d But Albright\u2019s title, That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do, lends added ambiguity. Who is speaking? Is it the soul trapped inside the dead body behind the door or the regretful old woman whose hand is about to turn the key to confront whatever lies within?\n\nThere is also an alternative origin story from Albright himself. In 1939 he told a newspaper writer that, walking in an unspecified neighborhood, he had come upon an old building with a wreath hanging on the door. Inspired, he began to sketch it but then realized that the wreath would only stay up for a very short time, whereas it would take him years to paint a picture. Accordingly, he struck a bargain with the owner of the building and \u201cpurchased door, wreath, and all.\u201d Albright obviously cooked up that last detail, but the rest may well be true. Then, as he worked on the monumental canvas, tiny bit by tiny bit, he wove in multiple intersecting strands of love, loss, life, death, spirituality, damnation, and salvation.\n\nBut it was no insular exercise in navel gazing, either. In The Door, death in the real world also came calling. The artist dropped one intriguing hint in that 1972 interview with Cummings. The waxen funeral wreath, he stated, was a \u201ccheap one so it wouldn\u2019t look like a gangster\u2019s funeral or a rich person\u2019s.\u201d What was it about gangster funerals that could possibly relate to Albright\u2019s painting?\n\nDuring Prohibition (1920\u201333) and even later, Chicago earned dubious pride of place as the capital of bootleg liquor and organized crime so bloody that by the late 1920s the very name of the city became a \u201cword of terror all over [the] world.\u201d Throughout the period, screaming headlines accompanied each Mob outrage and each Mob hit. There was a brisk trade in gory pamphlets issued on the pretext that tabloid-style photographs of bloodied victims would whip up public anger against violent crime. In actuality, such booklets catered to a burgeoning culture of morbid spectatorship that quickly developed around sensational criminal deaths. Many consumers of X Marks the Spot: Chicago Gang War in Pictures (1930), for example, were happy to pay for the chance to peer into the fancy living room where gangster Pasqualino \u201cPatsy\u201d Lolardo lay dead (see fig. 6), blood pouring from a head wound and bottles of bourbon and wine on his marble-topped table.\n\nAnother such publication (with the same ostensibly moralizing intentions) ushered spectators into the morgue itself by way of gruesome photographs showing murdered gangsters on the slab. The ghoulishly curious could even go to the Cook County morgue to gaze at actual bodies, famously that of the desperado bank robber John Dillinger, ambushed and shot dead by FBI agents outside the Biograph movie theater in Chicago on July 22, 1934. Once Dillinger\u2019s remains had been delivered to the morgue and readied for viewing, avid crowds \u201cjammed in,\u201d swarming, pushing, and shoving to reach the room where the corpse lay. The Chicago Tribune described the tumultuous scene: \u201cSome . . . sighed or groaned with a pretense of horror as they looked at the body, tilted at a 45 degree angle to give a better view.\u201d At one point, those filing by would have spotted a young woman standing behind the glass with Dillinger\u2019s body. This was Josephine Medill Patterson, a newspaper heiress working as a reporter for the Daily News and Albright\u2019s future wife. The coroner\u2019s investigator had jokingly pushed her into the room and left her there for fifteen minutes.\n\nExcept for Patterson\u2019s morgue adventure\u2014long before she met Ivan\u2014all this might seem rather by the way with respect to the artist at that time. But Albright was keenly aware of gang wars, gang murders, and gangsters\u2019 bodies. It is too tempting to speculate that he might have seen the grisly photograph of the dead body of Vincent \u201cThe Schemer\u201d Drucci in the morgue (fig. 7). We cannot know if he did. Yet given the eerie match between word and image, a poem the artist wrote in the 1930s suggests that he could have: \u201cThe black eyes stare / Like dark agates / The mouth is open and still / A hot breath blows across him / Moves the air / As a moll / Looks at him on morgue slab / Not him.\u201d Clearly, Albright paid close attention to Chicago crime.\n\nGangsters\u2019 funerals earned almost as much coverage in the media as their murders. Highly visible and enormously expensive affairs, they were attended by gangland\u2019s elite, watched by huge crowds, and lavishly reported in the newspapers. Mike Merlo\u2019s funeral set the precedent. Head of the Chicago branch of Unione Siciliana, a fraternal organization, Merlo was not officially a mob boss but had deep underworld connections and immense authority. Gangland paid tribute accordingly: the funeral flowers, said to have cost one hundred thousand dollars, overflowed the house and spilled out onto the front lawn. Many of the elaborate arrangements came from Walter Scholfield\u2019s North Michigan Avenue flower shop co-owned by the flamboyant bootlegger Dean O\u2019Banion, whom Merlo had shielded from vengeful rivals. Once Merlo was gone, O\u2019Banion\u2019s enemies were quick to dispatch him in that very shop. For O\u2019Banion\u2019s funeral, even more lavish than Merlo\u2019s, \u201cgangland did the honors in style.\u201d The silver-bronze casket with embossed silver posts at the four corners cost ten thousand dollars, and it took \u201ctwenty-five motor trucks to carry the flowers.\u201d And when Tony Lombardo met his gory end, his boss, Al Capone, sent a \u201cgreat heart of red roses eight feet high with \u2018To My Pal\u2019 worked in white roses across it.\u201d Outside Lombardo\u2019s house (see fig. 8) in suburban Cicero, the enormous floral wreaths overwhelmed the front yard.\n\nAlbright\u2019s assertion that he wanted his wreath to be a cheap one, not like a gangster\u2019s funeral, makes little sense without this context. The wreaths produced for gansters\u2019 funerals were massive, abundant, and showy. Albright\u2019s was modest and inexpensive. And yet the fact that he took an interest in Mob-land rituals as well as morbid spectatorship\u2014as suggested by his ghoulish poem\u2014suggests that something about Chicago\u2019s violent crime and murdered criminals contributed to the conception and execution of The Door. Sensational death dominated the local media; it was endemic to the urban climate of the era. In a certain sense, The Door registers Albright\u2019s acute sensitivity to that climate, though obviously the painting is not about gangland violence per se. We might think of that context as a mostly buried, yet faintly visible, layer in his tantalizing palimpsest of references and allusions.\n\nAt the same time, the painting is about obsolescence: everything in it, from battered door to grandmother\u2019s handkerchief, is old and worn. As noted, the actual door as well as the brass threshold and the marble doorstep came from Chicagoland junkyards, of which there were many; house wrecking was a going concern in an era in which Victorian houses and commercial buildings increasingly faced demolition to make way for new structures (see fig. 9). Commentators Lloyd Lewis and Henry Justin Smith worried that the \u201cdaemon\u201d of innovation was sweeping the city, and it had \u201ccome to the height of a passion for tearing up, improving, substituting, enlarging . . . a student of the city will have to hurry if he expects to take home a memory of the older Chicago . . . benign nineteenth century houses are fairly tumbling before the invasion of smart, tall, money-making buildings.\u201d Even in neighborhoods where grand old mansions still stood untouched by the wrecker\u2019s ball, there was the inevitable thought: \u201chow soon will they pass?\u201d\n\nAlbright was hardly alone in his quest for antiquated and unloved things. A number of other painters, including Charles Burchfield, Edward Hopper, and fellow Chicagoans Aaron Bohrod and Francis Chapin, rejected the ethos of progressive modernism, opting instead to depict desolate Victorian houses, tumbledown city blocks, and shabby decor of the last century. During the tumultuous decades of the 1920s and 1930s, such imagery worked symbolically to suggest that the past still exerted a psychic stranglehold on the present despite a concerted drive to bring about a bright, clean, efficient new era in American society. Victorian houses and things were reminders of a rampant cultural degeneration that many associated with late nineteenth-century American life and excoriated as a lingering and blighting influence on the contemporary scene. Hardly an exercise in nostalgia, Albright\u2019s Door embodied a haunting past that would never die, however much it moldered and decayed.\n\nThe wax wreath was a holdover of the Victorian age too. In the nineteenth century and continuing well into the twentieth, many wakes still took place in the family home despite the rise of the funeral industry. When a death occurred, families would display black crepe door badges to signal that they were in mourning. By the final decade of the nineteenth century, though, floral wreaths\u2014symbolizing memory, eternal love, and victory over death\u2014had taken their place. By 1930, door baskets had become the newest fashion, but wreaths on easels or other supports (as seen in the many arrangements piled outside the Lombardo house on the day of his funeral [see fig. 8]) were still ubiquitous. Wreaths of artificial flowers or woven human hair appear in countless memorial photographs of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as well, framing photographic portraits of the deceased (see fig. 10). Such portraits were also often surrounded by wax, hair, or fabric-flower wreaths and mounted in shadow boxes lined with crimped satin that recalled coffin lining. Incorporating such references\u2014coffin lining and all\u2014The Door was an unsettling reminder of human mortality.\n\nDespite (or because of) its chilling subject, The Door was a popular hit from the time Albright first exhibited it, unfinished, at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1938, when people \u201cshowered\u201d it with \u201cbest picture\u201d votes. Gallery visitors were drawn to the haunting presence of the painting, its ghastly aura of corruption and eerie menace, and\u2014until Albright removed it\u2014the coffin-like frame. Critics freely interpreted the details: \u201cThrough the keyhole creeps the fume of death,\u201d wrote one; another supposed that the words of the long title were likely to \u201ccome from a dead body in a room to which the door opens.\u201d When a columnist describing the \u201cgloomy mortuary door\u201d asked the artist about that \u201cwisp of smoke,\u201d he teasingly responded, \u201cWell . . . when a body starts to decay\u2014\u201d leaving the rest to the imagination.\n\nViewers\u2019 enthusiastic reactions could have been conditioned by the graveyard atmosphere of horror movies, which\u2014from the time of the sensational release of Frankenstein in 1931\u2014had become enormously popular escape valves from the actual horrors of the Depression years. Quite a few of these early horror movies, like The Old Dark House (1932), Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931), and Dracula\u2019s Daughter (1936), were either set in the Victorian past or (if happening in modern times) featured Gothic-horror elements such as grave robbing, moldering manor houses, murky dungeons or torture chambers, corpses, and mad killers.\n\nPeople may also have brought their reading tastes into the galleries. Perhaps William Faulkner\u2019s 1930 macabre short story \u201cA Rose for Emily\u201d came to mind for some. In this tale, the reclusive Miss Emily Grierson\u2014alone since a mysterious \u201csweetheart\u201d disappeared many years before\u2014is a living relic of the old moonlight-and-magnolias South. For decades, almost no one (except her black manservant) has even glimpsed the inside of her house. When Miss Emily finally dies, curious neighbors enter the house and explore every room except one locked bedroom upstairs. Once Miss Emily lies safely in the ground, the townsfolk break down that door to find the body of the vanished suitor, poisoned by Miss Emily some forty years before: \u201cA thin, acrid pall as of the tomb seemed to lie everywhere . . . the man himself lay in the bed . . . What was left of him, rotted beneath what was left of the nightshirt, had become inextricable from the bed in which he lay . . .\u201d As their feelings of horror mount, the nosy neighbors discover the worst thing of all: on the adjacent pillow is the indentation of a head and a strand of Miss Emily\u2019s long, iron-gray hair. The locked door has finally given up its dreadful secret.\n\nThere were sinister portals in pulp fiction at the time, too. Harold Ward\u2019s 1933 Weird Tales chronicle \u201cThe Closed Door,\u201d for example, follows the same general plot lines as Faulkner\u2019s story. Having poisoned her abusive husband, Lucinda Marsh locks the door to the room where he breathed his last. For years, the door remains locked, the key hidden away in a bureau drawer. At last, though, the guilty widow cannot resist revisiting the scene of her crime. One stormy night, she approaches the \u201cdark, grim door.\u201d She hesitates but finally inserts the key in the lock. It turns hard, \u201cas if reluctant to reveal the mysteries\u201d it hides within. The tumbler shoots back, and, with a squeak of ancient hinges, the door opens to reveal a musty and mildewed room with grotesque shadows dancing in the corners. The goblet that held the poison still stands on the bedside table, and the sheet that Lucinda had used to stifle her husband\u2019s dying breath lies tumbled across the back of a chair. In the morning, people find Lucinda\u2019s dead body, the yellowed sheet twisted about her head and throat.\n\nAlbright was coy about his reading habits, and we can only speculate whether he had any familiarity with Faulkner\u2019s story, let alone the lowbrow Weird Tales (which he probably would deny ever reading, even if he did). The same goes for his audience. But the trope of the mysterious locked door and the creepy old mansion appeared in so many old and new mystery thrillers, ghost stories, and horror movies that it is safe to say that for artist and viewers alike, an ancient, moldering door automatically connoted mystery, weirdness, and danger both natural and supernatural.\n\nWhat did lie behind Albright\u2019s door? He hinted that the answer lay in his next major work, Poor Room&lt;\u2014There Is No Time, No End, No Today, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever, and Forever, and Forever without End (fig. 11 [cat. 17]), the episodic completion of which, from 1942 to 1963, took even longer than The Door and involved the construction of an elaborate set. As in The Door, there is a bloated hand in one corner of the derelict brick-framed casement window, behind which we see a bewildering array of objects: a kerosene lamp\u2014still lit\u2014a chair, a flask, a key ring\u2014just to name a few\u2014all seemingly in motion as if caught up in a whirlwind. The colors are dingy, and all surfaces are rendered in microscopic detail. Albright offered an identification of this scene in one of his notebooks: \u201cThis is the room [beyond] the door with the funeral wreath on it.\u201d But where is the body?\n\nPoor Room is a murder mystery raised to the level of art. If it were pulp fiction, it could be the focus of a detective story, in which every object is a clue. Albright told an interviewer in 1950 that he had planned to include \u201cthe murderer\u2019s face in the red plush frame, now empty on the wall.\u201d Read literally, the disordered interior suggests that some terrible struggle has taken place: the broken window, the disordered furniture, the clothes strewn about, the incipient threat of fire from the overturned lamp. Tangled hair winds about the fingers of the disembodied hand\u2014which has a bleeding cut\u2014and trails down over the ledge. The girdle that lies just to the right above the hand insinuates that some kind of sexual violence has taken place\u2014a lust murder. But the murderer has departed, leaving nothing but a vacant frame. Albright told a Life magazine reporter that the undergarment \u201cjust happened to be there after a model had left the studio in a hurry one afternoon.\u201d A few years later, though, he claimed that the girdle had belonged to his mother, along with the black-sequin dress that hangs over the upturned chair. In the same interview, he also confessed that he had originally planned to include his own self-portrait looking out from behind the window. It all adds up to a disturbing glimpse into the artist\u2019s interior life.\n\nOr does it? Perhaps the painting is not to be taken too literally. Every work of art, after all, carries with it some trace\u2014more or less\u2014of its maker, but beyond that, interpretation is up for grabs. The interior we see in Poor Room constitutes an elaborate metaphor, at once public and private. Like nearly all of Albright\u2019s works, it is a vanitas, a meditation on impermanence, wreckage, death, and decay: the transient nature of all things. \u201cA picture,\u201d Albright said, \u201cis like a house wherein all things are to be found . . . a place wherein, side by side, rest decay and the sublime . . . In essence a painting is an astigmatized portrayal of you; it is your Rorschach.\u201d\n\nThe same can be said, finally, of The Door. It is by no stretch a self-portrait in the exact sense of the word but, rather, one that is distorted or, like the amorphous Rorschach inkblot test, an image the identification of which depends a great deal on the eye as well as the mind of the beholder. This helps make sense of the widely touted fact that in 1946 Albright gave the painting to his new bride, Josephine Medill Patterson. Many wondered how the artist could have thought such a gloomy work an appropriate gift. But if The Door was in essence a \u201cRorschach,\u201d then Albright was merely presenting his wife with an important but elusive piece\u2014or puzzle picture\u2014of himself: the family, the experiences, the memories, and whatever may have been the traumas that had shaped him as a man and an artist. Then again, there may be other and different secrets locked up\u2014entombed\u2014behind the door. In the end, we can never open it, but it continues to open up endless possibilities for speculation.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Ivan Albright and Josephine Albright, interview by Michael Croydon, Aug. 28, 1975, Michael Croydon Papers, series VI, box 2, folder 2.4, Ivan Albright Collection, acc. no. 1984.6, Ryerson and Burnham Archives, Ryerson and Burnham Libraries, Art Institute of Chicago (hereafter Ivan Albright Collection).\n\nDaniel Catton Rich, \u201cIvan Le Lorraine Albright: Our Own Jeremiah,\u201d Magazine of Art 36, no. 2 (Feb. 1943): 50.\n\nIvan Albright, interview by Paul Cummings, Feb. 5\u20136, 1972, Oral History Collection, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, transcript, 32\u201333; Michael Croydon, Ivan Albright (New York: Abbeville Press, 1978), 84\u201388; and \u201cAlbright Twins: They Paint Gruesome Masterpieces in an Abandoned Methodist Church,\u201d Life 16, no. 13 (Mar. 27, 1944): 69.\n\nDavid Elliott, \u201cRot and Revelation in Ivan Albright\u2019s Art,\u201d Chicago Sun-Times, Oct. 22, 1978.\n\nAdam Emory Albright, For Art\u2019s Sake (Chicago: privately printed, 1953), 62\u201364.\n\nAdam Emory Albright, \u201cMemories of Thomas Eakins,\u201d Harper\u2019s Bazaar 81, no. 2828 (Aug. 1947): 139.

Given Chicago\u2019s notoriety during the 1920s, it would have been challenging not to hear about violent crime there, no matter where one happened to be in the general vicinity.\n\nLloyd Lewis and Henry Justin Smith, Chicago: The History of Its Reputation (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1929), vii\u2013viii.\n\nFor more on Victorian survival in American art between the wars, see my article, \u201c\u2018Better for Haunts\u2019: Victorian Houses and the Modern Imagination,\u201d American Art 26, no. 3 (Fall 2012): 2\u201325.\n\nRobert W.
