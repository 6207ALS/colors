    "copy": " It was June 1890, and Charles L. Hutchinson, then-president of the Art Institute of Chicago, together with Martin Ryerson and two other museum trustees, were making a purchase of no little significance. The art dealer? The renowned Parisian gallery of Durand-Ruel and Company. The source? None other than Princess Demidoff (formerly Princesss Lise Troubetzkoi), widow of the late Prince Paul Demidoff of the Florentine branch of the Russian noble family founded by Count Nikolai Demidoff. The paintings? Let\u2019s look at the bill of sale: Hobbema, Rembrandt, Steen, and Van Dyck, and that\u2019s just for starters. These Demidoff paintings, however, were just a small part of a larger purchase from Durand-Ruel, primarily of Dutch and Flemish paintings, that was intended to jump-start the Art Institute\u2019s brand new collection. And to show what good taste these gentlemen had, a quick search revealed that at least two of these paintings\u2014Jan Steen\u2019s The Family Concert and Gerard Terborch\u2019s The Music Lesson\u2014 are still in the museum\u2019s collection! \u2014Katie Rahn ",
