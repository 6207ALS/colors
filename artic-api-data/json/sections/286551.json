R. Way , who erroneously recorded in 1905 that it was printed in Paris. Although Whistler did indeed draw the image in Paris, he never had it transferred or printed during his lifetime. The date of the transfer drawing has long remained elusive, but it can now be dated with reasonable certainty to the autumn of 1891 on the basis of technical evidence. The Girl was drawn on an inferior grade of commercially manufactured papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal similar, if not identical, to the transfer paper used by the artist for the color lithographs Nude Model, Back View (cat. 45) and Draped Figure, Standing (cat. 46). Whistler spent a week in late October and early November 1891 working in Paris with the printer Belfond on experiments in color lithography. It is likely that he drew The Girl with the idea that it might serve as the keystone for a color lithograph, but judged the drawing too awkward to develop it further. Although they are not grouped together in previous catalogues, cat. 45, cat. 46, cat. 47, cat. 48, cat. 49, and cat. 50 share similarities of subject and scale that, together with the fact that they were drawn on the same type of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, justifies the dating of all six drawings to late 1891, a period during which Whistler experimented, not always successfully, with the use of French transfer papers for color lithography.\n\nThe transfer drawing for The Girl was listed as \u201cUntried transfer No. 1\u201d and described as \u201c1st draped study. Drapery in both hands\u201d in the inventory of the artist\u2019s estate prepared by Rosalind Birnie Philip.

The image was still untitled when an impression was shown in the 1904 Memorial Exhibition in Boston, where it was listed in the catalogue as one of two \u201cundescribed\u201d draped figures (exh. cat, p. 31, nos. 77, 78).\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), pp. 52\u201353.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 47, only state.
