The first, Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14), was drawn in 1879 on coarse-grained transfer paper and was included in the Notes portfolio. The second, Back of the Gaiety Theatre (cat. 117), was drawn on stone in early 1895. The Manager\u2019s Window, Gaiety Theatre (cat. 150), the artist\u2019s third depiction of the site, was drawn on white transfer paper with a texture resembling that of a grained lithographic stone in January or February 1896. The second and third lithographs offer very similar views of the back of the theater as Whistler saw it from the Ways\u2019 windows. However, because Back of the Gaiety Theatre was drawn on stone, the image was reversed in printing; the later lithograph, drawn on transfer paper, shows the site in its correct orientation.\n\nIn his memoir of 1912, T. R. Way wrote an amusing yet telling account of Whistler\u2019s manner of working. His comments describe the 1896 session during which the artist drew The Manager\u2019s Window, Gaiety Theatre: \u201cI stood and watched him draw yet another Gaiety subject, and saw the chalk pass again and again over the paper without a mark made, until suddenly a firm line appeared. There was a rain-water pipe on the building, and when the line came to express it, it was not a pipe but the one of the building opposite as carefully drawn as if it had been an eye. It was his manner always, whatever he chose to put down was, as it were, a portrait of that object.\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 228 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (287 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (250 \u00d7 193 mm), signed.

Kennedy liked the lithograph and asked Whistler for three additional impressions; NYPL II/73; GUL W1252.\n\nWay (1912), p. 125. Way was most definitely recalling an incident that took place in 1896, when the third Gaiety Theatre drawing was made, although conceivably when writing his memoir he had in mind cat. 117, in which the rain-water pipe is more pronounced.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 150, only state.
