He capitalized on the fluid, meandering quality of the pen lines to describe the organic flower structures. He extended the drawing up to the edges of the sheet. The lower edge of the support has not been cropped, as microscope examination at 80\u00d7 indicates ink extends over that edge on the recto.\n\nThis sheet was removed from a bound sketchbook. The paper has six sewing holes along the right edge located 2.8, 7.9, 10, 17.2, 19.3, and 24.6 cm from the lower edge. At magnification 80\u00d7 translucent, yellow adhesive from the binding flowing into the sewing holes is visible on right edge of the recto. The moderate surface texture did not interfere with the freely moving pen strokes.\n\nSigned: HM (recto, lower right, in graphite) (fig. 45.1); signed: HM (verso, lower right, in graphite) (fig. 45.2).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink on the recto and the verso. The ink has a glossy sheen, most evident in raking light, indicating the presence of a resinous binder.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper removed from a sketchbook. The paper fibers are relatively uniform with very few colored fiber inclusions visible at magnification 2\u00d7. The bottom edge is straight cut. The right edge is straight cut with six indentations from sewing holes in the sketchbook binding. The top and left edges are imitation deckle edges, indicating that the paper is moldmade. A partial watermark appears in the upper right: []OT ARCHES (FRANCE) (1.5 \u00d7 2.2 cm) (fig. 45.3).\n\n28.5 \u00d7 38.3 cm (11 3/16 \u00d7 15 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nOn the recto, dense ink has been lost from the center of a flower at far left, 10 cm from the top and 4 cm from the left edges. It is likely that the ink dried while in contact with an adjacent sketchbook page and was damaged when the pages were separated. Surface fibers are disturbed in the same area of ink loss. There is a linear yellow mark at lower right. The sheet has yellowed very slightly.\n\nOn the verso (fig. 45.4), there is a region of light skinning evident in transmitted-light examination in the upper right quadrant, 6 cm from the top and 13 cm from the right edges. Surface fibers in this area appear disturbed and raised when viewed under magnification 4\u00d7. There is a small amount of adhesive residue along the lower edge, likely from a former mat or mount.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Dina Vierny (Jan. 25, 1919\u2013Jan. 20, 2009), Galerie Dina Vierny, Paris, by Jan. 25, 1966\u2013Mar. 1966.\n\nSold to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (c. 1921\u2013Jan. 5, 2015), Mar. 1966\u2013June 19, 2013.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 19, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Dina Vierny, Matisse: 24 dessins, Jan. 25\u2013Feb. 25, 1966, no cat. no.
