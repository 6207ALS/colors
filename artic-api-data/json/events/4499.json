Yet there are other ways that this museums like the Art Institute are evolving to meet the needs of a 21st-century audience. Join a conversation that takes museum history and practice as its subject, using different spaces and artworks as case studies.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
