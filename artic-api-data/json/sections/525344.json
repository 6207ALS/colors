A.D. 177\u201392) are uncomplicated: only the Rome mint was in use, and his careful listing of imperial titles such as imperator for the fourth time, holder of tribunician power for the fifth time, and consul for the second time provides a firm framework: this coin was minted in the year A.D. 180, during the last year of his father Marcus Aurelius\u2019s life and the start of his sole rule. Unlike nearly all previous emperors, Marcus Aurelius had a son who survived childhood and thus could inherit the throne, and Commodus was associated in rule with his father despite his youth (he was co-augustus since the age of seventeen).\n\nThe year 180 marked Commodus\u2019s return to Rome from his successful military campaigns in the north and his accession to sole rule. Accessions and triumphs were typical occasions to celebrate the new emperor\u2019s generosity (LIB[eralitas] AVG[usta]) toward his people, and this coin was likely itself part of the donatives handed out to populace and troops. Such donatives or \u201cliberalities\u201d encapsulated the patron-client relationship at the heart of Roman society, while playing a key role in the redistribution of wealth from conquest throughout Roman society. The specially minted coin may also have been calculated to jog people\u2019s memories of him distributing largesse in Trajan\u2019s Forum as a child, and prompt a warm welcome, while the name Antoninus conjured both his father (M. Aurelius Antoninus) and his adoptive grandfather (Antoninus Pius). The epithet pater patriae may appear premature as a title for so young a ruler, but in fact Commodus had already received it in the year he became coemperor with his father in A.D. 177, at the age of sixteen.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">RIC I 356.\n\nOnly Vespasian was succeeded by his natural sons, Titus and Domitian.\n\nDuncan-Jones, Money and Government, pp. 86\u201389.\n\nCasey, \u201cLiberalitas Augusti.\u201d\n\nRawson, Children and Childhood, pp. 66\u201367; a coin from that liberalitas is RIC III M.
