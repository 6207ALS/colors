    "description": "<p>At the beginning of his career, Lucas Samaras\u2014who is often linked with the junk or assemblage artists of the late 1950s and early 1960s\u2014transformed a large number of found and purchased boxes into glittering, fantastic, and often menacing objects. First conceived in 1962, <em>Box #53</em> belongs to a group of custom-made, yarn-covered boxes that incorporate stuffed birds. When the box is opened, a tape measure audibly calculates the height of the nine-inch opening. Inside are four compartments, one of which features a crystal encrusted rock. <em>Box #53</em> embodies a number of implied contrasts: nature\u2019s brilliantly hued birds and the man-made, colored yarn; the container\u2019s relatively modest interior and its flamboyant exterior; and the muted rock and noisy measuring device. \u201cI\u2019m never interested in ambiguous response,\u201d the artist said. \u201cRather a positive negative . . . touch or not touch, the quality of seducing-repelling.\u201d</p>\n",
