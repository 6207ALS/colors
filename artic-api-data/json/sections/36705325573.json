Harrison Collection, 1933.891\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Mario Uchard was drawn in graphite on tan wove paper. The artist used fine graphite lines to establish the general form and define facial details. Broad passages of graphite were applied to create the hair, and light parallel strokes were drawn to render the shading in the figure. Some areas captured the fine texture of the wove paper; this is most noticeable in the crook of the proper left arm (fig. 5.1). Touches of erasure sharpen highlights in the face, particularly along the left side, accentuating the wrinkles below the eye, and along the nose (fig. 5.2). Added modeling in the face was created with a stump.\n\nTan, medium-thick, smooth wove paper.\n\nUniform, without visible inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven, machine made.\n\nAll edges of the sheet exhibit some degree of irregularity; the top and right edges appear to be edge torn rather than cut.\n\n320 \u00d7 245 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. There is a light-yellow visible-light fluorescence under UV illumination that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nGraphite was used throughout. Fine lines establish the general form and define facial details, and broad passages, lightly drawn, create the hair and shadows in the figure. Areas of shading pick up the fine texture of the wove paper.\n\nTouches of erasure were used to sharpen highlights in the face, particularly along the left side, to accentuate the wrinkles below the eye and along the nose. Further modeling in the face was created with a stump.\n\nThere is no drawing on the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification. Some lines have been reinforced with a second stroke in the same red chalk.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition overall. The sheet is slightly discolored, particularly within the image area and corresponding to the opening of a former window mat. In addition, there is faint mat burn within the image area. Faint foxing spots are visible around the perimeter on the recto. The paper is slightly worn along the edges, and there is a diagonal crease and associated partial breaks across the bottom right corner.\n\nDark-brown ink inscriptions on the verso have formed light-brown halos along the ink lines. It is unclear whether localized degradation of the paper support, slight migration of the ink, or fixing of the ink caused the halos.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D499 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nG\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
