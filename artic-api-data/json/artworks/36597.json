Nearby, scholars wearing black hats linger over their departure. Within the thatched pavilion, two servants diligently pack up the remains of a farewell party. In ancient China, a handscroll would be viewed by unrolling it in segments, one arm\u2019s length at a time, from right to left. This handscroll would thus gradually reveal the travelers and the distant landscape, creating the effect of sending them off.</p>\n",
