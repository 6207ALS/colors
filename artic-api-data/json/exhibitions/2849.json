    "short_description": "This revealing exhibition examines 128 examples of artistic progression and comparison and includes work by 44 photographers. By comparing works 20 years apart, one can find those master photographers not only using similar subjects, approaches, and formal arrangements but also refining their perceptions as well as their ability to make use of a greater wealth of life experiences.\nPhotographers who improve and remain inventive and creative decade after decade are a welcome phenomenon in a \ufb01eld known too often for its hot streaks and short careers.",
