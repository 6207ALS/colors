    "transcript": "<p>Jena Carvana: Hi, I\u2019m Jena Carvana.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: And I\u2019m Rebecca Long.</p>\n<p>Jena Carvana: And we want to welcome you to El Greco: Ambition and Defiance. El Greco has been studied for centuries and a lot of different conclusions have been made that he was some sort of religious mystic, that he had some form of astigmatism and couldn\u2019t see correctly. But I don\u2019t think any of the studies of El Greco have really done justice to the artist that he was, the level of ambition that he had.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: We\u2019ve brought together works that will take you from the very beginning of El Greco\u2019s career when he was an icon painter on Crete. We\u2019ll look at his work in Italy when he\u2019s studying in Venice and Rome. And then we\u2019ll follow him on a journey searching for patronage from Rome to Spain and that\u2019s where we\u2019ll really see El Greco develop as an artist that we recognize today.</p>\n<p>Jena Carvana: And as we go through this exhibition we will show you that El Greco was an artist who knew who he was, knew the type of art that he wanted to create and who fought to defend this art. So in our first stop we\u2019ll meet you in Crete where El Greco begins his long career as an artist.</p>\n",
