    "copy": " A leading practitioner of conceptual art, Mel Bochner (born 1940) was one of the first artists to introduce language into the visual field in the 1960s. Despite their significance, these contributions remain unexplored in art-historical scholarship. Mel Bochner: Language 1966\u20132006 includes over sixty works in a wide range of media and brings together for the first time an overview of the artist\u2019s language-based works from the past forty years. Highlights include the landmark piece Working Drawings and Other Visible Things on Paper Not Necessarily Meant to Be Viewed as Art (1966), which art historian Benjamin Buchloh called \u201cthe first conceptual art installation.\u201d Also featured are Bochner\u2019s series of magazine interventions published between 1966 and 1968; a number of early word portraits of Bochner\u2019s contemporaries (including artists Dan Flavin, Eva Hesse, and Donald Judd); and new photography of Bochner\u2019s seminal installations Theory of Boundaries (1970) and Axiom of Indifference (1973), which the artist re-created at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006.   Long preoccupied by language and its influence on vision and perception, Bochner has shifted recently from a more analytical approach to an exploration of the ways in which color diverts a text from its duty to convey meaning. Recent works reproduced here include If the Color Changes (1997\u201398), You Can Call It That If You Like (2004), and several of Bochner\u2019s vibrant paintings of synonyms drawn from Roget's Thesaurus , many published here for the first time. This compelling book includes an essay by art historian Johanna Burton that analyzes this important body of work and examines Bochner\u2019s definition and use of language throughout his career as well as an insightful conversation between the artist and noted scholar James Meyer.
