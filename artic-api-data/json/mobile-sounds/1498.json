    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Even though it's more than 50 years old, the design of this chair still looks completely fresh and modern. People call it the &quot;Tulip Chair,&quot; but to the designer, Eero Saarinen, this chair was one piece of his Pedestal Group. Like George Nelson, the designer of the ball clock often installed nearby, Saarinen was an architect who wanted to break from tradition. Brandon Rude, from the Art Institute's American Art Department.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE:  Eero Saarinen wanted to free furniture design, modern 20th century furniture design, from.. over-stylization, over-ornamentation, and.. essentially create spare, simple, organic designs. And he referred to 18th and 19th century furniture design as having a slum of legs, and that of course meant that it was over-ornamented and over-designed. He was interested in experimenting with contemporary, meaning mid-20th century, materials, such as plastic and fiberglass. He attempted a chair that had one single pedestal or leg, and have it created out of fiberglass or plastic. Unfortunately the technology of the time wouldn\u2019t support this, and so ultimately this chair had the base made from aluminum so it could actually support the seat, and painted white to match the fiberglass chair.</p>\n",
