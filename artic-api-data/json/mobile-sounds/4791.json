    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>Another Kruger installation is positioned at the far north wall of the Michigan Avenue ticketing room. The top half of the composition features white type on a horizontal green band. Underneath this are five alternating bands of black and white, with contrasting type in white and black. The work reads, WHY ARE YOU HERE? TO LOOK, TO LEARN, TO THINK, TO GROW, TO SEE AND BE SEEN, TO EAT, TO BUY, TO HAVE AN EXPERIENCE, TO POSE, TO PLAY, TO QUESTION, TO ANSWER, TO SELFIE, TO BELIEVE, TO DOUBT?</p>\n",
