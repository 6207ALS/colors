    "description": "<p>All Souls Unitarian Church is one of the few projects that can be attributed solely to Marion Mahony Griffin, an architect who spent her career working with Frank Lloyd Wright and her husband, Walter Burley Griffin. The congregation of this church, located in the Chicago suburb of Evanston, embraced poetry and theater as part of spiritual life. Mahony Griffin reflected these characteristics in an intimate and atmospheric design that featured an abundance of stained glass in its skylights, windows, and light fixtures. Although small in scale, the church prefigured her later work with community theaters, specifically in the bold, prismatic forms that would come to define the Griffins\u2019 practice.</p>\n",
