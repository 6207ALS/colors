    "description": "<p>Sara Cwynar re-presents and remakes existing images to examine nostalgia, kitsch, the stoking of consumer desire, and the ways photographs circulate in altered form. Employing interventions such as collage and re-photography of vernacular and commercial source images, she produces intricate tableaux that reveal how the visual strategies of popular images infiltrate our consciousness. Among her key works are sculptural constructions that are photographed, printed, tiled, and re-photographed; images taken from darkroom manuals that are deconstructed using a scanner; and stock photographs that are collaged by hand and then re-photographed.</p><p>Cwynar (Canadian, born 1985) currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Recent exhibitions include <em>Hard to Picture: A Tribute to Ad Reinhardt</em>, Mudam, Luxembourg; <em>Subjektiv</em>, Malm\u00f6 Konsthall, Sweden; <em>You Are Looking at Something That Never Occurred</em>, Zabludowicz Collection, London, UK (all 2017); and <em>Greater New York</em>, MoMA PS1, Queens, NY (2015/16).<br><br>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event.</p>",
