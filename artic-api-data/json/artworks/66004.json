The structure of the composition is severely flattened, the foreground marked by shrubs and the background by mountain peaks; sandwiched in between, are earth-colored geo-metric planes marked with dots and lines referencing fields and plant life. Drawing on the decorative vocabulary that he discovered in indigenous Southwestern pottery, blankets, and jewelry, Marin incorporated pyramids, triangles, and zigzag patterns to establish borders that hold his dynamic composition in check.</p>\n",
