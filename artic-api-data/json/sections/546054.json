Mosaic glass technique. In a translucent, turbid, grayish-blue bubbly glass is the proper right side of a theater mask, probably female. The mask consists of sections of canes that form a shaded yellow to yellow-brown face, features highlighted in an amethyst line including the pupil outline and iris as well as the eye and eyebrow that abuts the line forming the nose and nostril. The iris is turquoise in white; the eyelid is red. The hair is huge: a marbled swirling of amethyst, brick-red, and yellow-brown threads interrupted by three complex elements radiating from the face. Above the eyebrow at the hairline is a short, meandering cane of yellow-brown spirally wound with red. Sprouting from the top of the head, just above the eye, may be a horn, which has a bright medium-blue rectangular base with a diagonal garland of red and a flame-like finial of alternating bands of yellow and brown. The two additional elements that break the overall swirling pattern of the wig are composed of rows of scalelike elements of alternating yellow-brown and amethyst. Each element is different but contains a cane of concentric circles in yellow-brown and amethyst but with an offset central amethyst rod at the bottom and at least two small rods of red above the larger amethyst element. The first element below the horn touches the head and spreads out in a curvilinear form, flat at the opposite end with two feather-like elements of gray-blue with an inner line of red forming a V. The second element floats in the hair. The shape is more blunted and ovoid with a large truncated area of the body following the line of the hairstyle and touching the matrix.\n\nChips on all edges, but the top and sides appear to be original. Probably one-third of the lower inlay is missing. The surface is polished with many remaining pits; some elongated air bubbles are seen as holes in the surface. The back surface is flat and dull.\n\nWhat looks like a hornlike protrusion over the eye resembles a modern birthday candle in its garish coloration. The second element looks like a bird with elaborate blue and red tail feathers pecking at a red-brown \u201cworm\u201d on the forehead. The brick-red color of this cane is different from the red in the hair. The third element does not resemble a bird at all but is more blunt at the end near the face and open at the edge of the hairstyle. It resembles the inverted head of a horse or cow with a large eye. Clearly at this level of miniaturization, elements move and can become distorted; without a parallel it is difficult to identify the subjects intended.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 79 Fragment of an Inlay Depicting a Theater Mask, late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
