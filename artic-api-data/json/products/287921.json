    "description": "<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">These flat candles were first pioneered in Eastern Europe, the only decorative handmade flat candle in the world. Poured and decorated by hand in Lithuania using the highest quality German materials. Dripless, smokeless, self-extinguishing. Each candle comes with an easy-to-assemble steel base thus no need for any additional stand/tray. Arrives perfectly packaged in a box, ready for gifting.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>2.4 x 0.4 x 5.9 in.</li>\n</ul>",
