    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This magnificent king vulture is powerfully modeled from the feathers of its sweeping wings to its sharp cool claws. It perches on a tree stump whose white glaze is a perfect foil to its strong coloring. The vulture was made in 1734 at the famous Meissen porcelain factory near Dresden in Germany. Founded in 1710 under the patronage of King Augustus the Strong, ruler of Saxony, Meissen was the first European factory to discover how to make hard paste porcelain. This material previously only had been made in China and since the seventeenth century in Japan. August the Strong was Meissen\u2019s foremost client. A passionate lover of art and architecture, Augustus commissioned porcelain sculptures of the birds and animals of the world. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: One of its great sculptors, a man by the name of Johann Joachim K\u00e4ndler was set to work on creating an aviary and menagerie of birds and animals in porcelain. Augustus the Strong had a king vulture in his aviary in Dresden and there are records for K\u00e4ndler drawing this from life. So I think he really was able to infuse this bird, this sculpture with the essence of its life.</p>\n",
