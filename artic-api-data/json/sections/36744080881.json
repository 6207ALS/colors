The compositional lines were worked out primarily in pen and black ink. Fine, delicate lines were used to render the sitter\u2019s delicate facial features and impart the delicate grasp of the bill in his hand (fig. 12.1). In other areas, slightly thicker lines spaced closely together or hatched create shading and tonal passages. Renoir employed brush and black ink to create dark passages in the sitter\u2019s shoes, hair, and hat (fig. 12.2); in the upper left figure\u2019s bag; and in the foreground grass.\n\nThe artist then applied Cont\u00e9 crayon to form medium tonal passages in the sitter\u2019s clothing and in the underside of the umbrella as well as to create a sense of depth (fig. 12.3). The Cont\u00e9 crayon picks up the moderate surface texture of the paper, creating a grainy appearance in the tonal passages. Renoir introduced highlights into the composition by leaving the light tonality of the paper exposed in the building facade at the upper left, in the top of the umbrella, and in the foreground, creating the illusion that light is striking these surfaces. The left margin of the sheet is devoid of media and appears to have been formerly folded behind the sheet early on in the drawing\u2019s execution.\n\nRenoir (recto, lower left, in pen and black ink) (fig. 12.4).\n\nIvory (discolored to cream), medium-thick, moderately textured laid paper.\n\nVertical, 2.7\u20132.8 cm.\n\n9\u201310 cm.\n\nUniform, without significant inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven, possibly machine made.\n\nDeckle edges are present along the right side, and top and bottom edges; the left edge is cut straight.\n\n452 \u00d7 354 mm.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nPen and brush and black ink were used to create the compositional lines, over which Cont\u00e9 crayon was applied to establish broad tonal areas.\n\nThere is no drawing on the verso. Two spots of black ink are present in the center left area.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo artistic surface fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in relatively good condition overall. The paper support has discolored slightly overall, though it is darkest along the left edge. The paper appears to have been formerly folded along the left margin, forming a crease approximately 5.2 cm from the left edge. It is likely that the fold was created at the time the work was drawn, as there is some accumulation of media along the crease. A fine irregular fold in the paper extends from the left bottom edge up through the image area, terminating just before the top edge. This fold also existed early on, possibly developed after the sheet\u2019s formation; media accumulation is visible at the high points along the fold.\n\nOn the verso, in the center left area, there are two spots of black ink that appear to be similar to the drawing medium. These are visible through to the recto when the sheet is placed against a light surface; to minimize or reduce the visibility of these spots, the drawing is hinged against black rag matboard. The work does not appear to have undergone conservation treatment in the past.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Charlotte Labille (1889\u20131963), Paris, by Jan. 1, 1925.\n\nPaul Rosenberg (1881\u20131959), Paris and Bordeaux, by Sept. 15, 1940.\n\nConfiscated from Paul Rosenberg, Bordeaux, by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), Sept. 15, 1940.\n\nSelected by Walter Andreas Hofer (1893\u2013c. 1971) at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, for Hermann Goering (1893\u20131946) and transferred from the ERR to Goering, Dec. 2, 1941.\n\nExchanged by Hermann Goering, with Hans Wendland (born 1880) and Theodor Fischer (1878\u20131957), Lucerne, via Walter Andreas Hofer, early 1942.\n\nReturned to Paul Rosenberg, New York, June 3, 1948.\n\nProbably sold by the Rosenberg family to E.

Renoir, mon frere et me representant assis lisant au bord de la mediterranee est la propriete de Charlotte Labille/ Paris, 1 janvier 1925/ Edmond Renoir (see Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks and transcription). The mount is now lost. Correspondence in the Paul Rosenberg Gallery Archive confirm that Charlotte Labille was a regular client of Rosenberg\u2019s during the 1920s.\n\nSee pre\u2013World War II Paul Rosenberg Gallery, stock card number 1346 (the handwriting is nearly illegible; it could also be 8846) and Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), card PR 154. On the ERR card, under ZUGANGSTAG, or point/date of arrival or processing, it notes, \u201cPARIS: 22.3.44\u201d (or Mar. 22, 1944). However, this is incorrect as the drawing left France for Switzerland by the end of 1942, according to the Office of Strategic Services, Art Looting Investigation Unit, Consolidated Interrogation Report, no. 2: The Goering Collection (Sept. 15, 1945), p. 133\u201334.\n\nIn May 1940, Paul Rosenberg and his family relocated from Paris to Bordeaux. By June, the family emigrated from Bordeaux through Spain, leaving the collection behind. Louis Le Gall, Rosenberg\u2019s assistant, was at the house on September 15, 1940, when it was raided by German soldiers and the confiscated paintings and possessions were taken to the embassy for processing. See ERR card no. PR 154.\n\nSee ERR card PR 154, which indicates the final location of the drawing was Hermann Goering. Also see the Office of Strategic Services, Art Looting Investigation Unit, Consolidated Interrogation Report, no. 2: The Goering Collection (Sept. 15, 1945), pp. 133\u201334; attachment 1; and attachment 5, p. 11, no. 144. Notes on the back of the ERR\u2019s photograph of the drawing confirm that it was no. 144 in the Goering inventory.\n\nSee Office of Strategic Services, Art Looting Investigation Unit, Consolidated Interrogation Report, no. 2: The Goering Collection (Sept. 15, 1945), pp. 133\u201334. See also Records of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historical Monuments in War Areas (Roberts Commission), 1943\u201346, letter from the Commercial Secretariat of the British Legation in Berne, dated Dec. 29, 1944.\n\nIn a private lawsuit against Theodor Fischer, a Lucerne tribunal ruled in Rosenberg\u2019s favor on June 3, 1948, and ordered the picture returned. See Lynn H. Nichols, The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe\u2019s Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War (Knopf, 1994), pp. 419\u201320.\n\nAfter its restitution, the drawing was part of the Rosenberg family private collection rather than gallery stock. As a result, the Rosenberg Gallery Archives do not have a record of the sale or transfer of this drawing to E. V. Thaw and Company (founded by Eugene Victor Thaw [born 1927]). Paul Rosenberg\u2019s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Elaine Rosenberg, confirmed that the drawing was in their collection, hanging in the hallway of the New York residence, until transferred to E. V. Thaw and Company in the 1970s (private communication with Mrs. Elaine Rosenberg, June 2, 2014). According to Patti Tang of E. V. Thaw and Company, the gallery has no record of its intake.\n\nReceipt of object 27725 dated Oct. 17, 1977, and the permanent receipt RX 11324/2 dated Oct. 21, 1977, on file in Museum Registration, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">cat. 12 On the Terrace of a Hotel in Bordighera: The Painter Jean Martin Reviews His Bill (Illustration for Edmond Renoir\u2019s \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d), 1881.\n\nfig. 12.1 Detail of Renoir\u2019s On the Terrace of a Hotel in Bordighera: The Painter Jean Martin Reviews His Bill (1881) showing the artist\u2019s use of fine pen and ink lines to work out the composition.
