    "description": "<p>Natalia Goncharova first painted the subject of the Spanish dancer in 1916, while touring Spain as a set and costume designer with Sergei Diaghilev\u2019s traveling ballet company, the Ballets Russes. In this painting, the artist depicted a costume featuring delicate transparencies of lace and floral patterns. Inspired by the local flamenco tradition, Goncharova translated the fabric\u2019s radial lines into the axes formed by the dancer\u2019s hands, which fan outward in geometric vectors, building upon the abstract-cubist style she had developed in Moscow the decade before. After her time in Spain, the artist wrote, \u201cIt seems to me that out of all the countries I have visited, this is the only one where there is some hidden energy.\u201d</p>\n",
