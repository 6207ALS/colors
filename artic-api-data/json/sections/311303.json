Her designation \u201cuntried drawing\u201d referred to those few images that were drawn on stone but remained unprinted during Whistler\u2019s lifetime. Although T. R. Way (1905) recorded this image as having been printed in Paris, in fact he was mistaken. The only impressions of The Cap ever pulled were those printed by Goulding in November 1903. However, it is quite likely that the image was drawn on stone in Paris in late 1893 and then set aside in Whistler\u2019s studio when he decided not to send any more lithographic stones across the Channel to London for processing. This is known to have been the case with two other images he drew on stone in the fall of 1893 (cat. 74 and cat. 75), and was probably also true of The Draped Figure, Back View (cat. 77), the only one of this group of drawings on stone to have been printed during Whistler\u2019s lifetime. All four subjects are quite close in height, and they share stylistic characteristics such as the loose, sketchy handling of the crayon and the absence of stumping.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream laid paper (230 \u00d7 186 mm); Palmer, greenish ivory laid paper (231 \u00d7 185 mm); SC, greenish ivory laid paper (231 \u00d7 188 mm).

Later, T. R. Way must have mistakenly concluded that any subjects previously unknown to him and not included in Dunthrone\u2019s exhibition had been printed in Paris. This error was perpetuated in Levy\u2019s 1975 catalogue.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 78, only state. The Art Institute of Chicago, gift of the Crown Family in honor of James N.
