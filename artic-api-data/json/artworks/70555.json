    "description": "<p>Paul Manship designed <em>Indian and Pronghorn Antelope</em> to span the length of the mantelpiece in his New YorkCity apartment. He expertly used the negative space created by the separation of the hunter and his prey to capture the drama of the hunt. The work represents a compromise between historical artistic traditions and modern tendencies toward abstraction: the smooth planes and stylized renderings recall ancient Greek statues, while the arresting linear design and suggestion of movement reflect Manship\u2019s own innovations. Small-scale statuettes such as these were popular for interior decoration, and Manship\u2019s style was immediately accepted by the public.</p>\n",
