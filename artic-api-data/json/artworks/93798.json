    "description": "<p>Chicago artist Ivan Albright executed this grisly work for the 1945 movie adaptation of Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1891 novel <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. In Wilde\u2019s tale, a portrait of the young and attractive Gray decays as the protagonist leads an increasingly wayward life, recording the extent of his moral corruption in paint. Having established a reputation for capturing the macabre, Albright was the ideal choice to create such a horrific image that both attracts and repulses its viewers. The portrait appeared in vivid Technicolor, within the otherwise black-and-white film, causing a sensation. When Albright\u2019s canvas was exhibited at the Art Institute later that year, the Chicago Tribune reported that the museum \u201cis having a heck of a time handling the crowds flocking to see his painting.\u201d</p>\n",
