    "copy": " The floating face gazing out toward the viewer belongs to Beauford Delaney, a major artist of the Harlem Renaissance known for his modern paintings of New York life and his own vibrant portraits of its famous figures.   Famous for her strong, distinctive paintings of colorful flowers and arid landscapes, Georgia O\u2019Keeffe produced only a few completed portraits over her seven-decade career. Among them, five works feature Delaney, whom she met through the close circle of New York modernists cultivated by her husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz.   O\u2019Keeffe greatly respected Delaney and his art, describing him in a 1973 catalogue of his work as \u201cimpossible to define,\u201d \u201ca special experience,\u201d and \u201ca special kind of thought.\u201d Delaney, for his part, was particularly impressed with O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s work, which he considered to be \u201calive and quite amazing.\u201d   Here, O\u2019Keeffe called upon her formal training\u2014which included time spent at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014to create a sensitive portrait of her fellow artist using a finely detailed drawing style distinct from her more abstracted style of painting. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s focus on Delaney as the primary subject of her work in portraiture underscores his place among Stieglitz\u2019s carefully chosen group of influential artists and speaks to the deep affection O\u2019Keeffe held for him.   This impressive portrait joins the Art Institute\u2019s extensive holdings of over 20 major works by O\u2019Keeffe and makes a fascinating complement to Delaney\u2019s own boldly expressionistic Self-Portrait \u2014further strengthening the museum\u2019s collection of American modernism and offering a window into the relationship between two of its most enigmatic figures.   Delaney's self-portrait is on view in Gallery 262. ",
