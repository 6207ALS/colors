    "description": "<p>Working with the detritus of African American life, David Hammons addresses black history, African culture, racism, and poverty with a compassion and complexity unrivaled in contemporary practice. With cunning wordplay and biting sarcasm, he transforms found objects often culled from the streets of New York\u2014these include basketball hoops, chicken wings, dirt, and dreadlock clippings\u2014into powerful symbols that challenge stereotypes and confront issues of race. Street culture provides the artist not only with source material but also with a primary audience: Hammons often creates installations and stages performances on corners and vacant lots, notoriously shunning most of the art world\u2019s galleries and museums. The artist has said, \u201cI think I spend 85 percent of my time on the streets as opposed to in the studio. So when I go to the studio, I expect to regurgitate these experiences of the street. All of the things that I see socially\u2014the social conditions of racism\u2014come out like a sweat.\u201d</p>\n<p><em>Phat Free</em> begins with several minutes of darkness overlaid with an unidentifiable loud, metallic sound. As the video image is revealed, a man\u2014Hammons himself\u2014appears dressed in a long coat, felt hat, and sneakers, kicking a metal bucket down a deserted city sidewalk late at night. The work was shot in 1995 to document Hammons\u2019s late-night performance and edited into an independent video work four years later. At first seemingly violent, the noise evolves into an almost musical rhythm that is synchronized with the protagonist\u2019s methodical movements. The title elaborates this musical allusion, conjuring both the streetwise lyricism of rap and hip-hop and the improvisational nature of jazz.<br>The video\u2019s rough, grainy texture communicates the harsh reality of life on the streets and also evokes the early performance videos of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33349\">Vito Acconci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/19079\">Bruce Nauman</a>, and others. In and of itself, the action of kicking the bucket suggests the man\u2019s potentially unfortunate fate. At once jarring and poetic, Hammons\u2019s simple gesture becomes an act of symphonic proportion, a compelling metaphor for one kind of contemporary black urban experience.</p>\n",
