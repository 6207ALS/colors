    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: Meindert Hobbema was a master of 17th century Dutch landscape, depicting its woodlands and fields, flat landscape and cloud-filled skies with a serene grandeur.  This composition is anchored by an imposing clump of trees and by the low picturesque structure of the mill in the middle ground.  Hobbema enlivens these ordinary forms through the alternation of warm and cool tones in the leaves, the sun-bleached fields, and the worn textures of the mill itself.  Look closely and you'll see that what appears at first glance to be a rather still scene is actually filled with life.  Trees are windswept with leaves blowing in different directions.  Clouds scuttle through the sky, and the water cascades down from the mill.  Hobbema included other signs of life as well.  On the left side of the canvas you can spot a few villagers walking down a well-worn path.  This work was acquired by the museum in 1894, the year after the museum's Michigan Avenue building was constructed.  It was one of the acquisitions that helped launch the Art Institute to Chicago into the ranks of great American museums.</p>\n",
