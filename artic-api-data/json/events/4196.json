    "description": "<p>Christien Meindertsma thoroughly explores the life of products and raw materials in her work. In some instances, the result of a project is a record of the process. In others, her investigations lead to commercial products. Careful investigation and documentation, themes of local production, and underexplored resources characterize her work. Meindertsma seeks to reveal processes that have become distant in industrialization and encourage a deeper understanding of the materials and products that surround us.</p><p> Meindertsma\u2019s work can be found in the collections of MoMA (New York), The Victoria and Albert Museum (London), and the VitraDesign Museum (Weil am Rein). She won three Dutch Design Awards (2008) and an Index award (2009) for <em>PIG 05049</em>C. Her work <em>The Flax Chair</em> won the Dutch Design Award and Future Award (2016). Meindertsma graduated from the Eindhoven Design Academy in 2003.</p>",
