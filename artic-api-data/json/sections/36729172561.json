His decision to travel to this rugged terrain may have been influenced by the novelist Octave Mirbeau, who had a country house on the nearby island of Noirmoutier; that year Monet had joined Mirbeau\u2019s literary group in Paris, the Bons Cosaques (Jolly Cossacks). Fellow member and friend Pierre-Auguste Renoir had recently painted Breton landscapes, which may also have played a role in the choice. That same year Monet\u2019s friend and patron Georges Charpentier published an account by the writer Gustave Flaubert of an 1847 trip to Brittany, which contained impressions of Belle-\u00cele that could have piqued Monet\u2019s interest in that specific destination.\n\nBelle-\u00cele was famous for its fantastic grottoes, cliffs, and aiguilles (or needles; pointed triangular rock formations also referred to as pyramids). Sparsely dotted with hamlets, Belle-\u00cele had little tourist trade, which likely increased its appeal for Monet. In August the artist was making plans for a trip to Belle-\u00cele, and with a stipend of 2,200 francs from his dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, he left a month later. Monet intended to stay two weeks, but his campaign, as usual, became more complicated, and only at the end of November did he return, via a visit to Mirbeau in Noirmoutier, with some forty canvases for reworking at home.\n\nOn September 12 Monet arrived at the town of Le Palais, a fishing port located on the eastern side of the island, and checked into the H\u00f4tel de France. The following day Monet recounts to his companion, Alice Hosched\u00e9, that he explored the island and saw beautiful things; however, he complained that Le Palais was \u201ca real town,\u201d too far from these locations that he had just discovered. Within days of his arrival on Belle-\u00cele, Monet moved to Kervilahouen, a village of only ten houses on the other side of the island that was closer to the picturesque inlets scattered along the western side of the island, such as Port-Goulphar, an inlet studded with breathtaking rock formations (fig. 24.1). Monet rented a room in a modest house for four francs a day, which included meals of mostly eggs, fish, and lobster. As at \u00c9tretat the previous year, he roamed the cliffs and promontories, seeking out the most dramatic views. Instead of the beach with its evidence of human activity, however, at Belle-\u00cele Monet focused on the ocean-ravaged rocks at Port-Goulphar, Port-Coton, and Port-Domois and the smaller outlying formations. Monet would treat these aspects of the Belle-\u00cele coast in paintings that can be organized thematically into several subgroups, including ones depicting the Port-Coton pyramids (e.g., fig. 24.2 [W1084]), and the Lion Rock (e.g., fig. 24.3 [W1090]).\n\nThe decision to travel to Belle-\u00cele was a radical departure for the artist, who when not working at home in Giverny stayed in relative comfort, as at the beachfront hotel at \u00c9tretat. Arguably the most physically challenging destination to date for Monet, the island was a desolate location. Monet struggled particularly with the tumultuous weather, which required him to hire a porter\u2014the former lobsterman Hippolyte Guillaume, known as Poly (fig. 24.4). And yet the painterly potential of this unspoiled coastline fascinated the artist. In his letters to his dealers, friends, and Alice, he refers to Belle-\u00cele as \u201csinister, diabolical, but superb\u201d and \u201cvery beautiful but very savage;\u201d admitting to his dealer \u201cI am enthusiastic for this sinister land and precisely because it takes me out of what I am in the habit of doing.\u201d\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s painting is one of three versions anchored by the massive rock formations making up the Port-Goulphar (see fig. 24.5 [W1093] and fig. 24.6 [W1094]). In mid-October the island endured a weeklong tempest, documented by Monet in his correspondence. It is probable that he began the Port-Goulphar trio early in the month, prior to the storm. Depicting seemingly rare moments of reasonably calm seas, they show a range of weather conditions\u2014sunny in Coming into the Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (fig. 24.5), partly cloudy in Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (fig. 24.6) and overcast in the Chicago picture. Of these three canvases, the Art Institute work is the only one that crops out the two flanking rocks, which are present at the bottom of the other two compositions. In a modern photograph that shows the approximate view that Monet chose for the Art Institute\u2019s version (fig. 24.7), the cliffs that run along the outer edge of the Port-Domois are contiguous with the horizon. In another modern view of the inlet (fig. 24.8), comparable to the view seen in Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele, the signal station at Talut at the upper left is visible in the distance. Both Coming into the Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele and Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele are painted from spots similar to those seen in the modern photographs, but employ a lower vantage point, so that part of the cliffs at the horizon line on the right are obscured from sight. From the higher elevation of Rocks at Port-Goulphar, the modern photographs show that the signal station would have been visible at the upper left, but here it has been omitted, evidence of Monet\u2019s \u201cediting\u201d for pictorial reasons. Further, from this elevated view, the border of cliffs and the horizon are exactly aligned with each other. The rocks in the middle ground seem closer to us yet the cliffs at the edge of Port-Domois are still visible in the background. The outer edge of the Port-Domois provides a decorative border on the horizon that counter balances the bulky masses of these rocks in the middle ground.\n\nThe Chicago painting\u2019s canvas bears the stamp of the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros (fig. 24.9) and was found to have a warp-thread match with paintings from his previous Normandy campaign at \u00c9tretat (cat. 21 and cat. 23) indicating that Rocks at Port-Goulphar also came from the same bolt of raw canvas. Monet began his work at Belle-\u00cele with four canvases; by October 11 he was repainting the unsuccessful canvases (\u201cmauvaises toiles\u201d) and waiting on \"fresh\u201d canvases that he had ordered from Troisgros Fr\u00e8res to be shipped to him. This new batch presumably would have borne the new Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvas stamp rather than the now out-of-date Vieille &amp; Troisgros stamp.\n\nThe Belle-\u00cele group was likely conceived in Monet\u2019s usual manner: finding, framing, and sketching in front of his motif, reworking the same canvas during the same or a later session, and making final assessments and retouches in his studio. For the Art Institute\u2019s composition, on the other hand, Monet seems to have abbreviated his usual working process, painting more directly with minimal reworking. See, for example, the early delineation of the rocks, whose borders of exposed ground can be detected with the unaided eye (fig. 24.10). These masses, as well as the sky and water zones, were then filled in with a variety of brushstrokes worked wet-on-wet and in many areas only thinly applied (fig. 24.11). The horizon\u2014interrupted by the top of the line of cliffs, which are delineated by a dark purple paint\u2014was also asserted from the beginning (fig. 24.12). In comparison to the vertical Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (fig. 24.6), dated 1887, whose elaborately variegated brushwork for the rocks and water suggests a greater degree of reworking, the changes to Rocks at Port-Goulphar seem minimal. The reddish-brown base of the cliff at the far left foreground has been extended slightly into the water. In addition, a few of the brighter strokes that were painted over already dried paint, notably the blue strokes under the signature (fig. 24.13), speak to additional painting session, possibly upon his return to his Giverny studio.\n\nThese paintings of monumental and isolated rocks surrounded by water but devoid of human, animal, and even plant life were a personal, emotional response to the motif, an approach Monet would further develop in his series paintings of the 1890s (see cats. 27\u201332). In the context of Monet\u2019s struggle with the elements while out on the cliffs of Belle-\u00cele, his repeated use of the term \u201cterrible\u201d takes on a connotation different than the \u201cterrible\u201d sublime in nature sought by artists in the late eighteenth century. For Monet it indicated a powerful psychic force, both awesome and exhausting. Mirbeau, who came to visit Monet while he was working at Port-Goulphar, noted in a letter to Rodin that \u201c[the Belle-\u00cele paintings] will be a new aspect of his talent: a terrible and formidable Monet, unknown until now. But his works will please the common public less than ever.\u201d On the contrary the art dealers Durand-Ruel, Theo van Gogh (representing Boussod &amp; Valadon) and Georges Petit all believed the opposite and clamored to acquire the paintings as soon as Monet would allow them to leave his studio in 1887. In the spring of 1887, Monet exhibited at Georges Petit\u2019s 6e Exposition internationale de peinture et de sculpture. Out of the twelve works by Monet listed in the catalogue, ten were from the Belle-\u00cele campaign (including the portrait of his porter, Poly [fig. 24.4]). The Art Institute\u2019s painting was not among those exhibited in 1887, but its closest cognate, Coming into the Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (fig. 24.5), was both shown and purchased in 1887 by Petit and was no doubt the image the journalist Gustave Geffroy had in mind when he described the rocks as \u201cPachyderms with thick crusts.\u201d\n\nThe two months at Belle-\u00cele were physically and artistically arduous. And even now, as Denise Delouche has made clear in her comparison of Monet\u2019s painting to the topography of Belle-\u00cele, the cliffs and summits remain inaccessible except by foot and, even then, dangerous. Comparing his works on the coastal cliffs of Antibes, a four-month campaign he would begin in January 1888, Monet noted the differences \u201cAfter Belle-\u00cele the terrible, it will be the tender: here there is only blue, pink, and gold, but what difficulty, good God!\u201d  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele was painted on a pre-primed, no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. There is a stamp from the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros on the back of the original canvas. A warp-thread match was detected with two other Monet paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection: \u00c9tretat: The Beach and the Falaise d\u2019Amont (1885; 1964.204 [W1012]) (cat. 21) and The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat (1885; 1922.428 [W1025]) (cat. 22), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. The work was directly painted with very little deviation from the initial lay-in of the composition, which appears to have been rather cursory. The placement of the rocks was delineated with light brushstrokes. Broadly applied, thin applications of dull-brown and dull-purplish-gray paint were used to lay-in the dark, shadowed areas of the rocks. In the sky there is an intermittent pale-gray underlayer. An open network of thicker, impasted strokes was applied first in the water, imparting much of the texture there. In all areas of the composition, however, the brushwork remains open, with small areas of exposed ground remaining visible at the surface. The artist worked up each major element of the composition separately, often leaving a border of exposed ground around the edges of the forms, but working back and forth between the different elements and building up the composition as a whole. The surface brushwork consists largely of wet-in-wet paint application, suggesting a fairly rapid buildup of the painting. Technical examination detected one minor modification to the composition: the extension of the reddish-brown base of the front left rock farther into the water.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 24.14).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 86 (lower right corner, in light orange-brown paint) (fig. 24.15, fig. 24.16). Some of the underlying paint was still wet when the painting was signed, specifically the thicker, light-bluish-gray strokes near the bottom edge (fig. 24.17). This could suggest that the bluish-gray strokes were added later to the painting, as final touches, just before the artist signed the work.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 81 cm, which corresponds to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas, turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave; average thread count (standard deviation): 26.1H (0.8) \u00d7 28.7V (0.8) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with \u00c9tretat: The Beach and the Falaise d\u2019Amont (1885; 1964.204 [W1012]) (cat. 22) and The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat (1885; 1922.428 [W1025]) (cat. 23).\n\nModerate, fairly even cusping is present around all four edges; the cusping is slightly stronger along the left and right edges. There are a number of irregularities (i.e., thicker threads and nubs) scattered throughout the canvas.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1974 treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes, spaced 5.5\u20138 cm apart, correspond to the cusping pattern (fig. 24.18). An additional series of small pinholes, spaced at fairly regular intervals, was observed around the edges of the painting in the area of the original foldovers (5\u20136 holes on each side) (fig. 24.19). It is difficult to tell when the holes were made because of subsequent abrasion around the edges; in addition, the open holes are filled with wax-resin adhesive applied during the 1974 lining (see Conservation History), while other holes have been filled and retouched. The origin and purpose of these holes is not known.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Current stretcher depth: 2.7 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. An undated report on file records that that stretcher was five membered with a vertical crossbar and mortise and tenon joints. The report gives the following dimensions: overall, 65.5 \u00d7 81.7 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; stretcher-bar width, 7 cm; inside depth, 2.5 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; and length of mortise, 7 cm.\n\nPrior to lining, a tracing was made of a supplier\u2019s stamp on the original canvas back. Text within palette-shaped frame: H. VIEILLE E. TROISGROS / [. . .] RUE DE [. . .] / PARIS / COULEURS [. . .] / TOILES PANEAUX [sic] (fig. 24.20). The original canvas back is now obscured by the lining canvas, but traces of the stamp were visible when the painting was imaged using transmitted-infrared light (fig. 24.21).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. It consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 10 to 100 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 24.22). Several bubble holes were observed where the ground is exposed on the painting surface.\n\nThe ground is off-white. Under the microscope, a few dark and possibly red particles were visible (fig. 24.23).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground layer contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of bone black, iron oxide, alumina, silica, and silicates. Binder: oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe work appears to have been executed relatively rapidly, with no significant alterations in the composition from how it was initially laid in. The brushwork is fairly open, with small areas of exposed ground visible throughout the composition, and consists largely of wet-in-wet paint applications. The work, however, was probably carried out in more than one session, since the underpainting and the thick strokes of impasto in the water appear to have been dry when the upper paint layers were built up. The main compositional features\u2014the rocks, sky and pools of water\u2014were built up separately with only minimal overlap along some of the edges as the painting was worked up (fig. 24.24). A border of exposed ground often remains visible at the junctures of these forms. This is particularly evident along the horizon and around the pools of water (fig. 24.25). Where the rocks overlap one another, on the other hand, there are no distinct borders between them.The artist built up the composition as a whole, working back and forth between the different areas with some wet-in-wet overlapping of strokes at the edges of some forms.\n\nThe composition was broadly mapped out to delineate the placement of the rocks; however, the lay-in appears to have been rather cursory, without the use of an overall underpainting. Along the horizon, the rocks seem to have been outlined using a relatively dry brush. This is evident, for example, along the tops of the background rocks at the far left and center, where a thinly applied stroke of dark purplish paint, deposited mainly on the high points of the canvas, seems to be related to the earliest lay-in, marking the upper edges of these landforms (fig. 24.26, fig. 24.27). The surrounding sky and water were brought up to these outlining strokes, and then the rocks were built up (fig. 24.28). In some areas, such as the plateaus at the top of the central rock, the artist used thicker, more textural brushstrokes to lay in the basic forms (fig. 24.29). The foreground rocks consist of a relatively open network of brushstrokes, with areas of exposed ground between strokes, especially on the sunlit faces (fig. 24.30). In some places, near the edges, the rocks look like they were blocked in with flat, dull-brown and purple-gray tones. The distant rocks and shadowed rock on the right side have more continuous underlayers, in the form of thin applications of dull-purple and dull-green, which are incorporated into the final painting (fig. 24.31). Only one minor adjustment was observed in the painting: the base of the left foreground rock was extended further to the right. A closer view shows that the reddish-brown paint from the rock was added on top of the water (fig. 24.32).\n\nThe sky appears to have been built up in a single wet-in-wet session after the initial lay-in. As observed in other areas of the painting, the lay-in\u2014visible here and there, mainly near the horizon, as a thin, brush-marked, pale-gray layer\u2014seems to have been very summary, with areas of ground left exposed throughout the sky, especially near the upper right corner (fig. 24.33). The brushwork consists of discrete strokes of yellow, blue, pink, and green, mixed with varying amounts of white paint, all worked wet-in-wet (fig. 24.34). There are also a few thicker brushstrokes of lead white\u2013rich impasto, (fig. 24.35). The blue calligraphic strokes (right of center) were also applied on top of wet paint (fig. 24.36).\n\nThe water was laid in with a series of long, horizontal and diagonal textural strokes of pale-purplish-gray paint, which can be seen in the X-ray (fig. 24.37). The lighter areas where the sky is reflected also seem to have been indicated in this underlayer (fig. 24.38). The shorter strokes and touches of more intense blues, greens, and purples of the water were applied over top when the underlying strokes were already dry (fig. 24.39). The pale-purplish-gray underpainting strokes and the ground layer remain exposed in places, especially in the sunlit areas of the water, creating the effect of light flickering off the surface. Some of the white areas are also the result of daubs of lead white\u2013rich strokes applied on top. Overall, the palette consists of fairly subdued or earth-toned colors, but the artist applied localized touches of relatively pure paint from the tube that is quite brilliant, especially when viewed under magnification. These are often some of the final touches to the painting and can be seen in the bright blues and greens in the water (fig. 24.40, fig. 24.41, fig. 24.42), as well as the occasional touch of bright red in the rocks. The area of water just below the horizon was applied in three or four broad horizontal strokes, with a few additional shorter strokes filling in the edges. A lightly applied, dull-greenish-blue, dry-brush stroke was applied over the dried paint of the water to emphasize the horizon (fig. 24.43).\n\nThere are a few small, localized areas of deep-blue and deep-green paint in the sky, close to the top edge, near the center and on the left side, which appear to be unintentional accretions (fig. 24.44). When viewed microscopically, these marks appear to be partially covered by paint from the sky, suggesting that they were acquired while the work was being painted. They could be accidents from handling or related to paint transfer from an easel cleat or transporting device.\n\nBrushes including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence of areas of reddish-brown paint in the rocks and reflections suggests the liberal use of red lake.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a synthetic varnish, which imparts a variable surface sheen\u2014glossy in some areas and matte in others\u2014depending on the qualities of the paint application. During the 1974 treatment, a discolored varnish was removed; the origin of this varnish was not documented (see Conservation History)\n\nIn 1974, a discolored surface film was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Minimal inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched flat and taut on an ICA spring stretcher. The new stretcher was slightly larger than the original; as a result a border of unpainted ground from the original tacking margin is visible around the edges of the painting. Retouching was applied to the edges to tone out the exposed ground, especially along the top edge. There is general wear and abrasion of the ground layer, as well as old paper and glue residues, on all tacking margins. The paint layer is in good condition, with only a few very small losses near the edges. Some moating and flattening of thicker impasto was observed, likely the result of the lining process. There is minimal cracking, limited mainly to thicker areas of paint application, with some localized drying cracks in areas of more fluid paint application. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layers. Starch-paste residues from the lining procedure are visible microscopically in the recesses of the more textural brushwork. The painting has a saturating synthetic resin varnish that is glossy in some areas and matte in others, depending on the qualities of the underlying paint.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame (installed by 1975) is not original to the painting. It is a French (Proven\u00e7al), late-seventeenth\u2013early-eighteenth-century, Louis XIV, scotia frame with carved corner foliate and center foliate-and-shell cartouches on a diamond bed with outer dentil, sanded frieze, and leaf-tip sight molding. It is water gilded over red bole on gesso with the ornament selectively burnished. The gilding is heavily rubbed; this and toning washes of umber and gray casein probably date to the pairing of the frame with the painting. The carved oak moldings are mitered and joined with angled dovetails. The original back of the frame has been planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame has been glued to the back, and the back and interior of the frame have been overpainted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ovolo with carved dentil; scotia side; scotia face with corner foliate and center foliate-and-shell cartouches; fillet; sanded frieze; and ogee leaf-tip sight molding (fig. 24.45).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 21, 1892, for 4,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Dec. 19, 1895 or Jan. 4, 1896.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland, Chicago, Mar. 6, 1897, for $2,000.\n\nBy descent from Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland (died 1933), Chicago, to her son Chauncey Blair Borland, Chicago.\n\nGiven by Mr. and Mrs. Chauncey B.

While Port-Goulphar is not specifically mentioned, Flaubert talks about a trip to the rocks and his descent from a cliff down to the beach; he describes: \u201cles rochers, \u00e9tendant \u00e0 l'infini leurs sombres masses de verdure, faisaient succ\u00e9der de l\u2019un \u00e0 l\u2019autre leurs t\u00eates in\u00e9gales qui grandissaient en se multipliant comme des fant\u00f4mes noirs sortant de dessous terre\u201d (the rocks, endlessly stretching their dark masses of greenery, followed one after another with their uneven tops, which grew while multiplying themselves like black ghosts emerging from beneath the soil).

Belle-\u00cele was famous for inlets. These indentations, referred to as ports, cut into the cliff face. Gustave Geffroy noted that \u201cEach of these indentations . . . is given the name of port in the language of the Island. Yet very few are actually used to harbor boats. Only Port-Goulphar . . . offers the necessary depth and safety.\u201d See Gustave Geffroy, Pays d\u2019ouest, ed.

See also Daniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 222\u201324.\n\nThe Belle-\u00cele campaign included thirty-eight paintings, which Monet \u201celaborated on the spot and later back home at Giverny.\u201d See Steven Z. Levine, \u201cSeascapes of the Sublime: Vernet, Monet, and the Oceanic Feeling,\u201d New Literary History 16, 2 (1985), p. 378. According to Charles Stuckey, Monet returned to Giverny with around forty paintings; see Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 214.

Monet first mentions hiring an old sailor in a letter dated September 22 (letter 691), but two days later mentioned that he was now without a porter (Sept. 24, letter 692). A few weeks later, Monet again describes a porter (Oct. 12, letter 710) and mentions Poly by name in a letter dated October 17 (letter 714). See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), pp. 277, letters 691 and 692; 280, letter 710; 281\u201382, letter 714. According to Charles Stuckey, this indicates that Monet worked with two different porters: the porter mentioned at the end of September quit, after which Monet hired a second porter, Poly; see Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 213. On the other hand, Wildenstein argues that the description Monet uses in the September 22 letter matches the general way Monet describes Poly, which suggests that Monet hired Poly at the end of September. Monet saying that he had no porter meant that Poly had only temporarily left his employ, but as the letters suggest, Poly returned. See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), pp. 52\u201355.

Totten and Seaton Schroeder, Bay of Biscay (Government Printing Office, 1876), pp. 338\u201339, who describe the Talus signal station as a yellow structure that signaled ships at sea.\n\nMonet may have had in mind Japanese prints when he conceived this birds-eye view of the rocks. Denise Delouche makes several comparisons between Japanese prints and Monet\u2019s views of Belle-\u00cele; see Denise Delouche, Monet \u00e0 Belle-\u00cele (Palantines, 2006), pp. 74\u201375. The most striking comparison is between Utagawa Hiroshige\u2019s Satsuma Province: B\u00f4 Bay, The Two-Sword Rocks (1856), a print owned by Monet, with his own views of the needles of Port-Coton. In addition, one of the Belle-\u00cele paintings, Lion Rock, Rocks at Belle-\u00cele, was later acquired, along with Young Girl in the Garden at Giverny (private collection [W1207]) by Tadamasa Hayashi, a dealer of Japanese prints, in exchange for prints by Kitagawa Utamaro, Hosoda Eishi, and Utagawa Hiroshige, underscoring the artist\u2019s interest and indeed the value he placed on these for his own collection. For more on Tadamasa Hayashi and Monet\u2019s collection of Japanese prints, see Genevi\u00e8ve Aitken and Marianne Delafond, La collection d\u2019estampes japonaises de Claude Monet \u00e0 Giverny (Maison de Monet, 1980), pp. 21\u201322.

I am grateful to Kimberley Muir, Assistant Research Conservator in the Department of Conservation, for bringing this article to my attention.\n\nIn a letter to Alice Hosched\u00e9 that Wildenstein dates October 11, Monet mentions that he is waiting for the canvases he requested from Troisgros: \u201cL\u2019apr\u00e8s-midi, j'ai repeint sur de mauvaises toiles du d\u00e9but; mais, pour faire d'heureuses pochades, il faut des toiles pures et j\u2019attends avec impatience celles que j\u2019ai demand\u00e9es \u00e0 Troisgros\u201d (In the afternoon, I painted over poor early paintings; but to make acceptable sketches, I need fresh canvases and I am anxiously awaiting those that I ordered from Troisgros). On October 13, Monet wrote to Alice that he had begun working because he had received the canvases he ordered.

I am grateful to Kimberley Muir, Assistant Research Conservator in the Department of Conservation, for bringing this article to my attention.\n\nSee Technical Report. Throughout his Belle-\u00cele campaign, Monet continually reworked his compositions. For this reason, he refused to send any of the works to his dealer, claiming that he needed to reassess the effect of the group back in his Giverny studio. See Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 214. In a letter to Durand-Ruel dated November 9, Monet says that \u201cNothing is finished and you know very well that I can\u2019t really judge what I\u2019ve done until I look over it again at home . . . I\u2019ll have a lot to do once I get back to Giverny.\u201d Translated in Richard Kendall, ed., Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters, trans.

(lat. terribilis; de terrere, \u00e9pouvanter). Qui cause de la terreur. Fig. \u00c9trange, extraordinaire: vent, bruit terrible; importun, fatigant: c\u2019est un terrible homme.\u201d Pierre Larousse, Nouveau dictionnaire de la langue fran\u00e7aise, quatre dictionnaires en un seul, 66th ed., illustrated and enlarged (Larousse &amp; Boyer R\u00e9unies, 1886), p. 753. Out of the at least seventy-six letters sent by Monet during his time in Belle-\u00cele, twenty-three of them include the word \u201cterrible(s)\u201d or \u201cterriblement.\u201d Most often it is used to complain about the terrible weather. However, Monet also uses \u201cterrible\u201d to describe the sea, the rocks, and the countryside in a letter to Alice: \u201cJe trouve le pays superbe, m\u00eame en dehors de ses terribles rochers et de la mer sauvage\u201d (I find the country beautiful, even apart from its terrible rocks and wild sea); in a letter to Gustave Caillebotte: \u201cun amoncellement de rochers terrible et une mer invraisemblable de couleurs\u201d (a mass of terrible rocks and an implausible sea of colors); and in a letter to Berthe Morisot: \u201cJe suis ici depuis pr\u00e8s de deux mois, un pays terrible, sinistre, mais tr\u00e8s beaux, qui m\u2019vait peu s\u00e9duit au premier moment, mais l'oc\u00e9an est si beau que je me suis embarqu\u00e9 dans une quantit\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes et plus je vais, plus je suis \u00e9merveill\u00e9; mais quel terrible temps!\u201d (I have been here almost two months, a terrible country, sinister, but very beautiful, which had little seduced me at first, but the ocean is so beautiful that I embarked on a number of studies and the more I go, the more I am amazed, but what terrible weather!). See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), pp. 277, letter 692; 280, letter 709; 286, letter 733.\n\n\u201cCe sera une face nouvelle de son talent: un Monet terrible, formidable, qu\u2019on ne connaissait pas encore.

Geffroy, perhaps channeling Monet\u2019s own language, uses Monet\u2019s favorite term to introduce his own discussion of the Belle-\u00cele paintings exhibited at the 6e Exposition internationale de peinture et de sculpture: \u201cPour la premiere fois, la terrible mer de l\u00e0-bas a trouv\u00e9 son historien\u201d (For the first time, the terrible sea out there has found its historian), see Gustave Geffroy, \u201cSalon de 1887.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the signature contains vermilion, viridian, and red lake; iron oxides may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Rocks\\_64\\_210\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 8, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings in the Art Institute collection, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a somewhat sketchy state with areas of exposed ground. Monet often added a few strokes to the edges just before signing the work. As his stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 noted, Monet \u201csigned his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u201d Quoted in John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1964\\_210\\_Monet\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 12, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the measured dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching of the painting on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Rocks at Port-Goulphar, Belle-\u00cele (W1095/1964.210),\u201d Oct. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the canvases for the three paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1012, 1025, 1095,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1964\\_210\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 12, 2014; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Rocks\\_64\\_210\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 8, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe paint occurs consistently at approximately 2 cm from the top edge of the canvas.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. Paint scraping samples taken in 1974 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1964\\_210\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 12, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201cMonet\\_1964\\_210\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Nov. 27, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Rocks\\_64\\_210\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 8, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 72\u201375.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, treatment report, Aug. 20, 1974, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA note in the conservation file indicates that the painting received a new frame for the August Collector\u2019s Show, May 30, 1969.
