    "description": "Sound the trumpets! Highlights of the Art Institute\u2019s spectacular collection of arms and armor are on special display. Featuring full suits, half suits, pole arms, cannons, and, for the first time at the Art Institute, a knight on horseback, this installation includes tapestries, paintings, and sculpture, bringing the viewer closer to the world where these objects might have been seen gleaming on the parade ground or heard clanging on the battlefield. Both young and old alike can marvel at the artistry and craftsmanship in these remarkable pieces of not-so-ancient history.",
