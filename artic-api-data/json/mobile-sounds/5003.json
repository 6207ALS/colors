    "transcript": "<p>Auvers, Panoramic View is an oil painting by Paul Cezanne from between 1873 and 1875. It measures about 2 feet high by 2 1/2 feet wide. The painting is a landscape of Auver-sur-Oise, a village on the northwestern outskirts of Paris.</p>\n<p>Auvers, Panoramic View shows the village and the open expanses beyond it from an elevated vantage point. Imagine that you are standing on a hill a short distance away from the village. Close to you, there is greenery. It isn\u2019t painted distinctly, but you can make out tall, thin trees and yellow-green grass. Then, a patchwork of houses and buildings comes into view. The buildings are rendered in light colors: white and tan. Their rooftops are blue, brown, and gray. Brown chimneys poke out here and there. Green foliage fills the spaces between the buildings. On the far left, you can see a tall white building with a single window. This was the home of one of Cezanne\u2019s earliest collectors, Dr. Paul Gachet. A dark green path leads out from Gachet\u2019s home to the horizon. Even further in the distance, where the buildings look the smallest, you can see a cluster of reddish-brown roofs in the center. A few tall trees stand out at this distance.</p>\n<p>Beyond the village, there are open fields, painted with patches of light green, dark green, and pale brown. The land begins to curve back upward into another hill. A pale sky fills the top quarter of the painting. Near the bottom of the sky thin, low-hanging clouds nearly touch the land below.</p>\n",
