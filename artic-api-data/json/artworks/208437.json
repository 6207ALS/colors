    "description": "<p>For more than a decade, architect J\u00fcrgen Mayer H. has been collecting envelopes lined with patterns and codes designed to keep the contents private. Used by banks to encrypt pass codes and PINs sent in letters to customers, these data sheets and patterns are recurring elements in Mayer H.\u2019s architecture, drawings, and design work. For Mayer H., they form the basis of a continued line of research into the relationship between architecture, communications, and new technology. Wirrwarr (which in German means \u201cchaos\u201d) features over 100 different preprinted data sheets culled from the architect\u2019s archives. In an increasingly coded landscape in which we communicate through acronyms and shorthand, the book, written by Philip Ursprung, reads as a record of these ubiquitous yet underexamined objects.</p>\n",
