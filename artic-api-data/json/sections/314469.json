The two men entered into a protracted negotiation, and a full two years passed before their discussions finally concluded with The Art Journal\u2019s inclusion of Whistler\u2019s transfer lithograph Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d in the December 1894 issue. Initially, Whistler rejected Thomson\u2019s invitation because the fee of a \u201cten pound note\u201d offered by the editor for \u201cthe use of the transfer\u201d was too low. When their negotiations resumed in the fall of 1893, their correspondence was devoted instead to the selection of an appropriate image, with Thomson suggesting first a recent Brittany lithograph (cat. 63) and then one of the new Luxembourg Gardens subjects (cat. 69).\n\nPrompted by Thomson\u2019s positive response to the Luxembourg image, Whistler asked the Ways if Conversation under the Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 69) would transfer successfully to supplementary stones for a large machine-printed edition. When the results of their experiment proved \u201ca little coarse,\u201d with the delicate stump work appearing too heavy, Whistler wrote to his printers that he should \u201cappear with something else to greater advantage in the Art Journal\u2014and so . . . had better draw something with the chalk alone\u2014for it is . . . evident that the stump can only do itself justice in the hand printing of proofs\u201d (letter 73).\n\nFinally, on 9 February 1894 Whistler sent the Ways a new Luxembourg drawing, made only the day before. He seemed convinced from the outset that Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d was a candidate for periodical publication because it was drawn entirely in crayon without any stumping. Furthermore, as Whistler wrote to T. R. Way, he had purposely used the German lithographic crayons recommended by Thomas Way for lithographs intended for printing in large editions (letter 81). Although Whistler was concerned that the lines produced by these crayons on the grained transfer paper might print too pale, he was pleased with the results when the first proofs arrived in Paris a few days later. He wrote back to the Ways asking them to \u201cclean a little about the off leg and foot of the boy\u201d and said that he hoped the figure of a nurse holding a child in the foreground could be made \u201ca little brighter.\u201d He made corrections in white on a proof and enclosed it with his letter (letter 83). Two surviving impressions of the first state bear the small marks that were subsequently removed from around the boy\u2019s legs, but there is no evidence that the printers actually attempted to \u201cbrighten\u201d the figure of the nurse.\n\nThere was a long delay between Whistler\u2019s execution of the image and its eventual publication in The Art Journal in December 1894. In July Whistler suggested several alternative subjects to Thomson (cat. 76, cat. 82, and cat. 83), but the publisher still preferred Nursemaids. In the same month, there seems to have been some hesitation on the part of the owners of The Art Journal, Messrs. Virtue and Son, about using the Way firm to print the edition for the journal. Whistler dismissed the question in an eloquent letter to Thomson, insisting that he would not allow another printer to handle his work. When the edition was finally printed, the artist received fifteen guineas rather than the ten pounds he had originally been offered. The lithograph was identified on the cover of the December issue of The Art Journal and in an accompanying article, \u201cArt and Mr. Whistler,\u201d as Les B\u00e9b\u00e9s du Luxembourg.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this image to a number of Luxembourg Gardens etchings (for example, K 428, K 430) that the artist must have made at about the same time as the lithograph. It is immediately apparent that working with crayons on fine-grained transfer paper permitted him an ease and freedom\u2014as well as a subtle range of gray tones\u2014that he could not obtain working with an etching needle on a grounded copper plate.\n\nMinor changes to the figure of the boy have not yet been made (fig. 81a). An impression of this rare state is illustrated in Edward Kennedy\u2019s revised edition (1914) of T. R. Way\u2019s catalogue.\n\nLondon: BM, cream chine (Japanese paper, 223 \u00d7 171 mm) mounted on white plate paper (325 \u00d7 243 mm).\n\nRemarks: A signed first-state impression is found in Ann Arbor, private collection.\n\nThe stray crayon marks around the right leg and foot of the young boy in the center of the composition have been cleaned off the stone. As a result, the child\u2019s astride stance is more clearly defined.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (297 \u00d7 213 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (310 \u00d7 203 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory chine (223 \u00d7 170 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (344 \u00d7 255 mm), signed; SC, ivory laid paper (333 \u00d7 212 mm).

The image was transferred to supplementary stones and printed by the Way firm. It was published in The Art Journal 46, no. 120 (December 1894), by J. S. Virtue and Co. Limited, London, and Patterson and Neilson, New York. The lithograph was printed by machine on coated ivory wove paper with a smooth, slick surface recto and verso. The majority of surviving impressions from the periodical edition have been trimmed. They are generally somewhat blacker than the hand-pulled impressions, and they can always be distinguished by the very characteristic paper used for the periodical. Nothing resembling this paper was used by either the Ways or Goulding for the impressions they printed by hand.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory wove paper (331 \u00d7 255 mm), rebound; ivory wove paper (329 \u00d7 253 mm).

Washington: LC, ivory wove paper (330 \u00d7 252 mm).\n\nRemarks: Periodical impressions are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, BPL and MFA; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.
