    "description": "<p>One of the most important figures in modern American photography, Harry Callahan was a humble and intuitive artist. He was largely self-taught, and as a teacher at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design (1946\u201361), he continued to learn by assigning photographic problems to students and then solving them himself. Influenced by both the classicism of Ansel Adams and the experimentalism of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Callahan fused formal precision and exploration with personal subjectivity. He photographed a wide range of subjects\u2014female pedestrians lost in thought on Chicago\u2019s streets; architectural facades; his wife, Eleanor; and weeds and grasses in snow. <em>Chicago</em>, one of his best-known pictures, shows trees covered in snow along Chicago\u2019s Lake Shore Drive. Although Callahan captured all of the detail available in the bark and snow in his negative, he purposely printed this image in high contrast to emphasize the black-and-white forms of the trees against the stark backdrop. With a graphic sensibility typical of the Institute of Design, Callahan reminds the viewer that a photograph is first and foremost an arrangement of tones and shapes on a piece of paper.</p>\n",
