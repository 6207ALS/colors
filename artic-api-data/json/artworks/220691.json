    "description": "<p>As part of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s workshop and exhibition Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream, Zago Architecture was one of five architecture firms enlisted to reenvision the American suburb. The firm examined Rosena Ranch, a largely unfinished suburban development in Rialto, California. The underlying premise of the firm\u2019s proposal, Property with Properties, was to misalign the typical suburban boundaries to<br>develop flexibility within the community. Using misalignment as a technique they developed a range of architectural possibilities that diverge from the typical suburban single-family house. This model depicts one of these homes with integrated structural panels of the patterned facade\u2014a contemporary building technique that breaks from the traditional stick-built construction and allows for fluidity between the planes to further<br>emphasize this new suburban proposition.</p>\n",
