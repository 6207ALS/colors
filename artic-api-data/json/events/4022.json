Saltz, a Chicago native known for his irreverent humor and sweeping, iconoclastic perspective on what the art world can and cannot be, do, and provide, joins us to offer a public intervention about key issues in contemporary visual art, and the increasingly visual\u2014though perhaps not artistic\u2014nature of our world.</p><p>Visit <a href=\"https://chicagohumanities.org/\" target=\"_blank\">chicagohumanities.org</a> for more information or to purchase tickets.</p><p>Art Institute of Chicago members receive a special discounted ticket price for this lecture in addition to programs on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chicagohumanities.org/events/104-ukiyo-e/\" target=\"_blank\">Ukiyo-e</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chicagohumanities.org/events/608-hairy-who/\" target=\"_blank\">Hairy Who</a>.
