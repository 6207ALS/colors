    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section tombstone\" id=\"tombstone\">Study of Tahitian Heads  \nc. 1898  \nWatercolor and pastel monotype from a paper matrix, with pastel, on cream Japanese paper, laid down on cream 4-ply mat board; 237 \u00d7 297 mm (primary support), 292 \u00d7 355 mm (secondary support)  \nSigned lower left, below image, in pen and black ink: Au Docteur / P Gauguin TAHITI  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, restricted gift of Mr. and Mrs. Edward McCormick Blair and through prior acquisition of Mr. and Mrs. Martin A. Ryerson Collection, 1993.171\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">A curious blend of watercolor monotype and charcoal and pastel drawing, this sheet had been dated circa 1902 based on the resemblance of the head in profile to that in a transfer monotype of circa 1902, Head of a Marquesan Girl (fig. 130.1 [Field 1973 91]).\n\nHowever, the Gauguin scholar Maurice Malingue, who once owned the Art Institute\u2019s sheet, dated it to 1896/97. Indeed, the profile head is close in expression and hair ornament to that of the standing figure in the 1896 painting No te aha oe riri? (Why Are You Angry?) (fig. 130.2 [cat. 90]).\n\nFurther support for a date of about 1896 is provided by the inscriptions on the sheet. It is inscribed at the lower left Au Docteur and signed P. Gauguin Tahiti. Mel Becker Solomon pointed out that this may refer to a Dr. Gouzer, who served onboard the ship Duguay-Trouin. In a letter dated March 15, 1898, Gauguin wrote to Gouzer, \u201cEvery day . . . I perceive that I have not said everything about Tahiti, that there is much more to say. . . . But I should live, you say. Why live at the expense of losing the reasons for living?\u201d Apparently, Gouzer met Gauguin when his ship docked in Tahiti and bought a canvas from him for one hundred francs, prompting the artist to give him two drawings. The painting purchased by the doctor appears to be Three Tahitian Women (fig. 130.3 [W 539]), now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The figure in the center of the painting and the profile head in the present sheet are strikingly similar, including the flower embellishing the hairdo of each. It is tempting to postulate that the Art Institute\u2019s drawing once belonged to Gouzer, which would place this sheet at least before 1898, the year when the doctor returned to France (presumably with his works by Gauguin).  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly from the artist to Dr. Gouzer, by 1898.\n\nMr. Maurice (born 1903) and Mrs. Maurice Malingue, Paris.\n\nTransferred from M.
