    "copy": " Were he still alive, Andy Warhol would be 85 years old today. And though it\u2019s been over 25 years since his death, his view of the world seems all the more relevant today. Warhol\u2019s devotion to celebrity, his appropriation of iconic imagery, and his famous prediction that \u201ceveryone will be famous for 15 minutes\u201d seem perfectly suited to our current age of memes and selfies. The Washington Post explored this same notion a few years ago in their article \u201c What Would Warhol Blog .\u201d After talking with friends and artists who knew him they surmised, \u201cHe\u2019d love it. He wouldn\u2019t get it. He predicted it all.\u201d Photography was always important to Warhol\u2019s artistic process. He photocopied iconic images of figures like Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse Tung to create his monumental silkscreen portraits but would go on to create screenprints based on his own photographs. He used a Big Shot Polaroid instant camera\u2014a model Polaroid reportedly kept in production just for him\u2014to photograph a wide range of people, from world-famous figures like Jimmy Carter and Arnold Schwarzenegger to lesser known tycoons, heiresses, and \u201cbeauties.\u201d Though the photos were mainly used to create his final portraits, Warhol\u2019s series of Polaroids are captivating in and of themselves. Stringing them together gives a certain insight into his process. There\u2019s something very arch in the way his models pose again and again with only slight variations in their expression and posture. And there\u2019s something more elusive, voyeuristic, eerie even, in looking at these unguarded moments on constant loop. It\u2019s almost as if Warhol was talking about the GIF when he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t life a series of images that change as they repeat themselves?\u201d \u2014Robby Sexton ",
