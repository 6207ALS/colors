    "description": "<p>Dreaming and relaxing, with the powerful designs of Vincent van Gogh, this beautiful new book will give you many hours of pleasure, and calm. Printed on high quality paper, this art book features 45 powerful Van Gogh artworks for you to color, offering a suggestion of how the original looked as well as key information such as title and date. Van Gogh is one of the most famous painters in the world, and his bold and visually expressive paintings evoke incredible emotional responses. This book will take you on an enjoyable journey where the satisfaction of creating stunning artworks is mixed with rediscovering the joy of coloring. You can use a wide variety of pens: from gel and pencil, to pigment and crayons, from ballpoint and rollerball to highlighters, although it\u2019s best to avoid the heavy felt pens. Each page is perforated near the spine of the book, so you can tear out and frame, or simply place your wonderful creation on the walls of your home, perhaps even send them as a gift to your loved ones.
