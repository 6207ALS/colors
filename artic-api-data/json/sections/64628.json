This faithful reproduction of the original necessitated select revisions to ensure a functional and legible experience for readers. Elements subject to change include typography, image placement, and chart formatting. Image callouts were added to the Whistler-Way Correspondance. Editorial choices were generally preserved; some punctuation, however, was updated to house style. Where we encountered the rare ambiguity or error, we have tried to offer corrections. Terms are updated to correspond to the glossary. Credit lines appear as published in 1998, except for works now in the Art Insitute\u2019s collection.\n\nThis digital publication is powered by ChicagoCodeX (CCX), an open source suite of software tools which provides an authoring and publishing environment for online catalogues with full scholarly apparatuses; intuitive book-like navigation; robust presentation tools for complex, multilayered images; and personalized reader annotation tools.\n\nThe OSCI team at the Art Institute of Chicago conceived and managed the project and the development of the ChicagoCodeX, which served as the foundation of the open-sourced, digital publishing platform OSCI Toolkit (oscitoolkit.com). The project\u2019s impetus and funding came from the Getty Foundation. The initial coding and technical implementation was researched and executed by the IMA Lab, a Web design and development consultancy of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nWe recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.\n\nBelow are examples of how to cite the different elements of this catalogue.\n\nHarriet K.
