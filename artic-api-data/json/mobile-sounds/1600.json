    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Curator of modern art Stephanie D'Alessandro.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: The standing woman and walking man that you see here are as large as we are. And yet they are so thin that they seem like the could break if we touch them. The surface of these works seem like they\u2019ve been charred, like they\u2019ve weathered the war.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The figures are by Alberto Giacometti whose work influenced by surrealism was profoundly affected by his experience of World War II and the Holocaust. As the writer Simone de Beauvoir put it, \u201cThe war was over, but it remained on our hands like a great unwanted corpse and there was no place on Earth to bury it.\u201d</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Alberto Giacometti was very interested in surrealism and participated in many exhibitions and produced many wonderful works that involve the idea of dreams and non-Western art and curious juxtapositions of things. But after World War II his art took a more serious turn. In the forties his works changed to focus on a kind of isolated figure who seemed lonely, seemed fragile, had a kind of skeletal appearance. They seem often very dark, almost made out of earth or material that was left after destruction. Many people see in Giacometti\u2019s work this kind of fragile existence that humans faced after the destruction of World War II.</p>\n",
