    "transcript": "<p>Annelise Madsen: This is a painting entitled &quot;The Window Seat&quot; by Francis Davis Millet, known as Frank Millet. I'm Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. We have a woman sitting on a window ledge dressed in early nineteenth century garb and she's attending to a needlepoint. There's this bank of windows behind her and that-- the light filtering through those windows and the drapery creates an occasion for Millet to explore light. This is a study of light, as well as a genre scene. What Millet is demonstrating in a work like this is creating the atmosphere of feminized space. Right? This is a woman engaged in a traditional female activity of fancy work or needlework. So the flowers, the book, those are all, I think, activities that help tell this story about a woman working inside. So the window seat was exhibit at the World's Fair in 1893 and Millet himself spends significant time in the city as one of the fair administrators. He was the director of decoration. It was his job to hire the muralist and the sculptors and the other artists who helped create the experience of the fair itself in its buildings and its ornamentation. So in the 1880s, when Millet is working in this kind of detailed historically rich genre scene, Sargent is exploring impressionism in all its color and brushstrokes and subject matter. And in a nearby gallery, those examples of Sargent's work and impressionist painting in the 1880s are on view.</p>\n",
