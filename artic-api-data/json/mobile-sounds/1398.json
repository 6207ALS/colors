    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Look closely at the suspension loop attached to the top of this Chinese Bronze Age bell called a B\u0103o. Can you see a very abstract beak and a pair of eyes on either side? Here\u2019s Elinor Pearlstein, associated curator of Chinese art to tell us more about these mysterious beasts.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN: Some people identify these as dragons, others as griffins, and therefore see derivations in animal imagery of the Near East.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: We don\u2019t know what these animals originally symbolized or if their meaning changed as the traveled east.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  This bell was one of a set cast in graduated sizes. They\u2019re actually incredibly sophisticated musical instruments. Take a look at the bottom of the bell. It\u2019s not round.  It\u2019s almond or eye shape makes the sound die away quickly as opposed to round bells which have a sustained ring. Now, look for a band of abstract designs in low relief. Striking the outside of the bell with a mallet in the center of the decorated section produces a note or tone in one musical scale. Striking the outer edge produces a different tone higher in pitch. A round bell sounds the same no matter where it\u2019s struck. Finally, the raised spiral baoses [ph?] may mute diffuse vibrations giving the notes a crisp quality.</p>\n",
