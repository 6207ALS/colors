When needed, a third \u201cswing\u201d leg at the back of the table was placed at a perpendicular angle to support the open top. Opened, the table reveals four inset squared corners where candlesticks were placed. The recessed ovals held playing pieces known as fish because of their shape. The pieces were usually made of mother-of-pearl or ivory, and were kept in a small, secret drawer in the rear of the table.</p>\n",
