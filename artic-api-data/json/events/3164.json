We will cultivate our skills of observation\u2014relying on what we see rather than what we think we know\u2014to build drawing skills. The class will explore techniques and ideas in the studio, then move into the galleries to draw views created by artists in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, as well as actual landscapes found in the museum. Materials are provided.</p><p>For additional information about upcoming Member Sketch Classes, please call (312) 499-4111 or visit the <a href=\"/join-and-give/members/member-programs/member-art-classes-2015\">member art class</a> page.</p>",
