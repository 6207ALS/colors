Touring with Beatrix in the summer of 1893, he was charmed by the ancient houses and lively markets of the Breton towns that they visited. In total, seven transfer lithographs resulted from his working holiday in Brittany; five of these were processed and printed in black and white by the Ways in London (cat. 61, cat. 62, cat. 63, cat. 64, and cat. 65), and two color images were printed by the Belfond firm in Paris (cat. 66 and cat. 67). The frontal view Whistler adopted for this image links it to the color lithographs Red House, Paimpol (cat. 66) and Yellow House, Lannion (cat. 67), which reveal a similar fascination with the textures of the old facades and the light effects playing across them. It is interesting to note that when Whistler wrote the word \u201cHorloger\u201d above the central doorway he intentionally reversed it. This may have been calculated to make his public think the image was drawn directly on stone rather than on transfer paper.\n\nWhistler\u2019s characteristic concern for the placement of the butterfly signatures he added in graphite is apparent in impressions of The Clock-Makers, Paimpol. In many instances the image was printed high on the paper and the monogram added far below it, so as not to disturb the illusion of a brilliant, sunlit plaza before the building. In this and in other Brittany lithographs, the white ground is utilized as a compositional element in conjunction with the carefully placed drawn butterflies.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (329 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (368 \u00d7 243 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory chine (225 \u00d7 158 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (344 \u00d7 253 mm).
