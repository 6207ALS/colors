    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This image of the Buddha of healing was carved in Japan in the 10th or 11th century A.D.  It shows the enlightened Buddha, called Yakushi Nyorai, with his right hand raised in a gesture of reassurance and his left hand holding a medicine bottle, signifying his power to heal.  With legs crossed and eyes closed, Yakushi Nyorai assumed the traditional meditative pose.  He is seated on a lotus throne, a symbol of nirvana, the final stage of enlightenment.  Other signs of his enlightened state are the dot or third eye between his eyebrows and the bun-like bump on his head, which both signify wisdom.  One belief scholars have held is that his elongated earlobes may reference the heavy gold earrings the historical Buddha wore as a prince before he renounced all worldly goods to pursue enlightenment.  Buddhism spread from its Indian homeland to China and then reached Japan around the 7th century A.D.  Without supplanting Japan's indigenous religious practices, known as Shinto, Buddhism has a tremendous impact normal Japanese culture and art.  Yakushi Nyorai was an especially popular cult figure.  He was believed to bring his devotees not just relief from spiritual and physical suffering, but material success as well.  This sculpture was originally painted, at least in part.  Look closely.  You can see traces of the original red pigment on his face and the robe on the left shoulder.</p>\n",
