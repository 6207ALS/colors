    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Welcome to the Edlis/Neeson Collection.</p>\n<p>This group of 44 iconic works of contemporary art came to the museum through the generosity of collectors Stefan Edlis and Gael Neeson, longtime Chicagoans and supporters of the Art Institute.  Their gift\u2014the largest in the museum\u2019s history\u2014adds new depth to our encyclopedic collection. It gives us, for the first time, the chance to tell the extraordinary story of the Pop art movement of the 1960s. Here\u2019s collector Gael Neeson:</p>\n<p>GAEL NEESON: We came to Pop art and it was just like a \u2018a-ha\u2019 moment for us. We really really fell in love with it, and that helped form the rest of the collection, I think. Once we found pop art then we found the artists that related to pop art.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Today you\u2019ll see bold masterworks by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein working at the height of their abilities. But you\u2019ll also encounter artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg who paved the way for Pop in the 1950s\u2026and those, like Cindy Sherman and Takashi Murakami, who took Pop\u2019s legacy into the present. As you explore today, we encourage you to make your own connections within these galleries and throughout the Modern Wing.</p>\n<p>Your guides on this tour will be James Rondeau, President and Eloise W. Martin Director of the Art Institute of Chicago and Curator Kate Nesin.. Enjoy your visit.</p>\n",
