Here, many of the same structures on the distant riverbank are pictured in the misty atmosphere of first light. Early Morning and The Toilet (cat. 10) were the first lithotints Whistler produced after agreeing to provide a series of prints for publication in Piccadilly: Town and Country Life, a weekly magazine launched in May 1878 and edited by the artist\u2019s good friend Theodore Watts-Dunton. The magazine\u2019s circulation was poor from the outset, and it was hoped that the publication of new prints by Whistler would attract subscribers.\n\nWhen writing his catalogue of 1896, T. R. Way initially described Early Morning as \u201con stone, in wash and a little chalk.\u201d However, Whistler clearly considered this work to be primarily a wash drawing, and Way later amended this description to read simply \u201ca lithotint.\u201d A small wash drawing in the British Museum, London (M 588) (fig. 9a), about half the size of the lithotint, is closely related to this print in both handling and subject matter and could well have served as a preliminary study. A comparison between the drawing and the first proofs of Early Morning suggests the apparent ease with which Whistler adapted the brush-and-wash technique he used on paper to the surface of a lithographic stone. Nevertheless, he seems to have had trouble judging the values of the washes when he made this image and The Toilet (cat. 10) on a single large stone that the printers had prepared with two rectangular areas of half-tint. The two images were executed on one stone in order to save time and expense during the automated printing of the periodical edition.\n\nAs T. R. Way (1905) recorded, when the first proofs were pulled, Early Morning looked nocturnal, \u201cso dark as to represent a time before dawn.\u201d In addition, some of the washes had pooled and run together, making it difficult to read portions of the image. Way wrote that in order to achieve his intended effect of morning light and to clarify areas of visual confusion, Whistler reworked the stone twice with scraping, and the stone was re-etched after each of these alterations \u201cuntil the perfect silvery quality was attained.\u201d Only two or three proofs of each of these states were pulled by hand. Way recollected that it was only when Whistler was satisfied with the third state that the stone was \u201cput in the machine,\u201d and printing for the projected issue of Piccadilly commenced. Difficulties arose during the machine printing; the delicate stone destabilized, and the image began to darken as printing progressed. The \u201cold work began to come back, so once more the drawing was scraped and etched, but this last state appears clean and wanting in mystery.\u201d Despite the difficulties involved in the printing of this lithograph, in the end T. R. Way (1903) considered the work an \u201cexquisitely delicate drawing . . . the greatest triumph of all his litho-tints.\u201d Since Way indicated that the stone deteriorated during the printing for Piccadilly, it is likely that the stone was erased in 1878.\n\nAlthough the full edition of Early Morning had been printed for the July 18 issue, Piccadilly failed financially after the publication of the July 11 issue. Fifty impressions were selected from the edition and the rest destroyed when the magazine failed. Ironically, however, many more impressions of Early Morning were preserved than either of the two lithotints that actually appeared in the periodical, The Toilet (cat. 10) and The Broad Bridge (cat. 11). Judging from a letter written by T. R. Way to Whistler in late November 1895 (letter 160), when final preparations were being made for the exhibition of the artist\u2019s lithographs at the Fine Art Society, a number of impressions had remained in the Ways\u2019 possession during the intervening years. Way described the remaining trial proofs as \u201call very dark, like a nocturne,\u201d and explained that the prints he had sent to be signed by the artist were all trimmed Piccadilly impressions. In addition, he detailed \u201cperhaps 20 as good as those sent perhaps more, as there is a big packet of them in existance [sic] but mostly bad.\u201d Whistler probably signed all of the trimmed prints sent by Way. The invoice Way submitted to the Fine Art Society in March 1896 listed eleven impressions of Early Morning at twenty shillings each; nine were sold during the exhibition for four guineas each (apps. III.1, III.2). It would appear that the impression Whistler sold to the Providence collector Richard Canfield for ten guineas in May 1903 was the last in his possession, since there were none in the artist\u2019s estate.\n\nImpressions were pulled by hand before the extensive scraping of the stone to lighten the image. These impressions have a dark, crisp appearance and lack striations in the sky. Scraping with a pointed tool is evident only in the figure at far right, in the very fine lines in the background above the bridge, and along the waterline.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove proofing paper (276 \u00d7 379 mm); MWC, cream wove proofing paper (256 \u00d7 379 mm). London: BM, grayish ivory wove proofing paper (323 \u00d7 471 mm), printed together with The Toilet (cat. 10), and inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Early Morning\u20141st impression. Washington: FGA, cream wove paper (284 \u00d7 379 mm), inscribed, in Freer\u2019s hand, 1st state, Gift from TRW; LC, cream wove paper (258 \u00d7 340 mm); NGA, cream wove proofing paper (275 \u00d7 379 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in Cambridge, Mass., FAM.\n\nThe stone has been re-etched to lighten the overall tonality of the image, resulting in a more grainy surface quality overall. Diagonal scraping across the sky has generally lightened the tone and softened the edges of cloud formations in the left half of the image. Two small diagonal stray marks appear in the sky. The building at extreme left has been lightened by scraping, and vertical lines have been scratched on the bank below it. Re-etching has lightened the water. Scraping has lightened the roof and side of the structure to the right of the church; scraping has also created reflections under the arches of the distant bridge and below the barge (or barges) at right, and appears in the barge itself. The pair of figures at lower right has been reworked as well. The back and right arm of the figure on the left have been incised with fine lines. The figure on the right is scraped more extensively; the line defining his right side and hip has been removed. The lines of his left arm have also been scraped out, and the entire figure has become very white in tone (fig. 9c).\n\nLondon: BM, off-white plate paper (248 \u00d7 351 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Early Morning. 2nd state. Washington: FGA, cream wove paper (257 \u00d7 379 mm), inscribed, in Freer\u2019s hand, From Tom R. Way June 1905 / 2nd state or trial N<sup>o</sup> 3.\n\nPublished edition. Scraping in the water, especially below the barge at upper right, has brightened the reflections. Additional scraping is visible in the building to the right of the structure next to the church. In the figure at far right, a line has been added to indicate the waistband; the right contour of the figure\u2019s back and his left forearm have also been delineated. The two diagonal stray marks in the sky have been removed (fig. 9e). These impressions, printed by machine, are not as heavily inked, nor do they exhibit the same contrast of black and white, as the hand-printed first- and second-state impressions. Printed legends were added although Piccadilly failed before Early Morning could be issued; many impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream wove paper (177 \u00d7 270 mm); cream wove paper (183 \u00d7 271 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG, cream wove paper (182 \u00d7 270 mm). London: BM (2), cream wove paper (181 \u00d7 272 mm), signed; cream wove paper (180 \u00d7 267 mm). Washington: NGA, cream wove paper (182 \u00d7 271 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks:Other third-state impressions from the published edition are found in Boston, MFA; Cincinnati, CAM; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.\n\nPublished edition. Changes to the stone were made in the midst of machine printing the edition for Piccadilly. The stone has been re-etched to lighten the overall tonality of the image and to reverse the effects of clogging. A series of incised vertical lines appears in the structures along the waterline above the barge at right. Scraping has enlarged and altered the shape of the mounds on the barge itself. The slag heap or warehouse next to the church has been lightened by re-etching and scraping. The lines delineating the waistband and right contour of the foreground figure have been removed. The arches under the bridge have been clarified still further by scraping (fig. 9g). Many impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend; the subject did not in fact appear in the periodical, which ceased publication after the July 11 issue.\n\nLondon: BM, cream wove paper (249 \u00d7 349 mm), with legend, and inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Early Morning. Final state. Washington: FGA, cream wove paper (186 \u00d7 271 mm), signed, and inscribed verso (erroneously), in Freer\u2019s hand, 2nd state.\n\nRemarks: Other fourth-state impressions from the published edition are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA (2); Boston, MFA (2); Brooklyn, TBM (signed and inscribed on retained fragment of secondary support, in Whistler\u2019s hand, Battersea Dawn rare Stone destroyed); Cambridge, Mass., FAM; Cleveland, CMA (2); New York, MMA; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.
