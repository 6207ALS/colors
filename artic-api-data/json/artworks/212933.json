    "description": "<p>Chicago native Tony Fitzpatrick is both an artist and a poet. He has been a fixture of the Chicago-area art scene since the 1980s, and in 2009 was proclaimed by Newcity as the \u201cbest iconic Chicago personality now that Studs [Terkel] is gone.\u201d \u00a0Prints illustrating his poem <em>Bum Town</em> amply demonstrate Fitzpatrick's reflections on his beloved hometown in word and image. \u00a0This book-length poem, published in 2001, is a gritty homage to his father and the disappearing Chicago of his own youth. Fitzpatrick\u2019s verse recounts memories of driving around Chicago in his father\u2019s Oldsmobile as together they listened to a White Sox baseball game on the radio. The duo wind their way through the city\u2019s streets, recalling various now-long-gone landmarks on their way to return the ghost of Fitzpatrick\u2019s uncle, who died as a child, to his resting place in Mount Olivet Cemetery.</p>\n",
