    "description": "<p>Kenneth Josephson studied under Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design, receiving his master\u2019s degree with a 1960 thesis entitled <em>Exploration of the Multiple Image</em>. Consisting of in-camera multiple exposures\u2014with changes of camera position, focus, time, and subject\u2014this project explored new photographic forms. In this image, the Rocky Mountains become an angular gradient, created by moving the camera eight separate times so that, as Josephson wrote in his thesis presentation, \u201cstatic subject matter is given a sense of movement which results from the mixing of gray values and forms.\u201d Hugh Edwards acquired 10 of Josephson\u2019s photographs the year that he graduated, demonstrating his early commitment to youthful talent, especially in Chicago.</p>\n",
