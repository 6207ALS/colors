The machine\u2019s beam of gaseous light and steam spews many tiny organisms and creatures into the sheets above (4A and 4B). The motif resembles one in the foreground of Jaques Callot\u2019s 1635 Temptation of Saint Anthony (fig. 2). Ensor also included a winged female figure with a serpent\u2019s tail, possibly a mythological harpy, to the right of the grotesque. Drawn partially over preexisting imagery, most clearly in the outer wing feathers, the harpy obscures a grimacing face. The cut-off arm suggests this figure was drawn from a plaster cast. Although it carries over into sheet 5B, the present sheet was cut down along the left edge and was not originally part of the same folio. Again, as in many of the sheets that make up row 4, numerous small faces fill the central area of the composition.\n\nThe cannon-like form\u2019s bulbous shape and stand are reminiscent of the carbon arc spotlights used in theater productions and the larger searchlights that combined carbon arc lights with the double spherical glass mirror invented by Colonel Alphonse Mangin (see fig. 3 and fig. 4). Searchlights were used in the Franco-Prussian War and in the early 1880s were also mounted on train engines. They could be found on the docks of Ostend port and were featured in the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 (see fig. 5). A camel\u2019s head, seen in profile, emerges from behind the base of the light, a reference perhaps to Brussels\u2019s Royal Zoological Garden in the Park Leopold (see fig. 6), located near the home of Ensor\u2019s good friends Ernest and Mariette Rousseau. When the zoo went bankrupt in 1878, all the animals were sold. With the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of Belgian independence in 1880, the zoo\u2019s grounds were turned into a public park, and a nearby convent was converted into the Natural History Museum, later the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences. In front of the camel is a drawing of one of the Ensor family\u2019s pet pugs (see fig. 7). Other camels, dressed as soldiers, appear in folio 6B/C.
