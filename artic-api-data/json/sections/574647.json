Deep ribbed bowl fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled to create exterior ribs, and polished. Fragment preserves a small segment of vessel wall with four tooled vertical ribs preserved on the exterior. A large cane or band of yellow-brown, sandwiched between thin bands of white with dark blue on either side, was folded and manipulated with segments of transparent blue to form a wavy pattern of reverse squared spiral elements that imitates banded agate or sardonyx.\n\nBroken on all sides; repolished interior face with light-brown weathering crust, some iridescence covers exterior and all edges.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 89 Fragment of a Bowl, late 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
