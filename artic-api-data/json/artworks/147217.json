(September 1993) / 1/7 Joel Sternfeld\"; unmarked verso\n\n\nCarol Stuart, seven months pregnant, was returning home from a birthing class with her husband, Charles, on the night of October 23, 1989. At 8:35 P.M., Charles Stuart called the police from his car phone to report that a black man had forced the white couple at gunpoint to drive to the predominantly black neighborhood of Mission Hill. In his desperate call for help, Stuart claimed that the man robbed them, shot and killed his wife, and shot him in the abdomen. \n\nDuring an intensive three-month investigation, police detained and interrogated numerous black men from the Mission Hill area. A suspect was about to be arrested when Matthew Stuart, Charles\u2019s brother and accessory to the crime, confessed that the entire story had been made up to collect insurance money and that Charles had shot his wife and wounded himself to conceal his crime. After learning of his brother\u2019s confession, Charles Stuart lept to his death from this bridge.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
