Wall revetment fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished on the face. The fragment preserves the left and top side of an inlay; the right and bottom edges are broken. In a deep-amethyst matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from segments of one cane: a stylized rosette with a central red dot and six surrounding yellowish-green dots all outlined in yellow and surrounded by a concentric ring of white dots.\n\nThe fragment is relatively thin in section. The face has been repolished but is still pitted; the edges and back are more heavily pitted with a dully iridescent weathering crust.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 95 Fragment of a Wall Revetment, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
