While into the new century some, including Jane Addams at Chicago\u2019s Hull House, continued to embrace the civilizing properties of crafts work, many others, among them Robert Riddle Jarvie, were in the crafts business.\n\nJarvie was born in 1865 in Schenectady, New York, to Scottish immigrants, and raised in Rockford, Illinois, and Minneapolis. In the early 1890s he moved to Chicago, where he had a ten-year career in the transportation field. In his free time, however, the initially self-taught metalsmith became interested in the fabrication of lighting and lighting fixtures. Alhough he would eventually produce a wide range of desk items, plates, andirons, lampshades, trophies, and other presentation pieces, his early advertisements almost exclusively feature lanterns, candlesticks, lamps, and candle sconces.\n\nIn January 1900, while still an employee of the Metropolitan West Side Railway, Jarvie was included in the Art Institute\u2019s Third Chicago Arts and Crafts Society Exhibition, where he displayed reproductions of a seventeenth-century Dutch lantern with horn lights and an eighteenth-century pewter smoker\u2019s oil lamp. His reproductions quickly gave way to an array of candlesticks. At the First Annual Exhibition of Art Crafts, held at the Art Institute in December 1902 and January 1903, Jarvie was represented by a bronze candlestick described as having a \u201cgreen finish.\u201d By 1903 Jarvie had nicknamed himself \u201cthe Candlestick Maker,\u201d and in December of the following year he presented four candlestick models, each identified by a Greek letter, including the Iota. By 1906 he offered for sale fifteen different candlestick models.\n\nLike several others in the series, the Art Institute\u2019s tall, slender Iota candlesticks flare slightly at the bottom and sit on unusually wide, flat discs that serve to stabilize them. At the top they swell like a flower bulb. Similar to some of Jarvie\u2019s other candlesticks, the Iota candleholders manifest their creator\u2019s awareness of Art Nouveau metalwork, with their attenuated stems and modified vegetal sockets. He would have been familiar with the candelabra of Jessie Preston, who also exhibited at the annual crafts shows at the Art Institute and who worked in a studio in Chicago\u2019s Fine Arts Building on Michigan Avenue. Jarvie would also have encountered examples of Art Nouveau metalwork in illustrations in House Beautiful, in which he advertised, and in which his own work was occasionally referenced, and at Marshall Field &amp; Co. in Chicago, which retailed Tiffany &amp; Co. wares. Indeed, Tiffany\u2019s green-patinated bronze candlesticks were the likely inspiration for Jarvie\u2019s verdegrene patination.\n\nThe silver-plated finish Jarvie chose for the Iota candleholders is atypical not only of his work, but also of Chicago Arts and Crafts in general, although Jarvie\u2019s contemporary Jessie Preston also experimented with silver plating (see cat. 73). In further contrast to much Arts and Crafts work of this time, the Iota candlesticks were realized by mechanical means, a felicitous marriage of style and material. The smooth surface of the cast-bronze candlesticks is well suited to accept silver plating, resulting in wares that would not be out of place on a table laid with sterling silver. Despite this aesthetic success, silver-plated objects by Jarvie from this period are rare.  \nBarbara K.

The family is recorded in the 1870 census as residing in Rockford, Illinois, and in the 1880 census, in Minneapolis. Robert R. Jarvie appears to have married Fannie M. Jarvie by 1889, and they had a son, Robert Jarvie (1889\u20131960). Death Certificate Index, Minnesota Historical Society. Jarvie divorced his wife in Chicago in March 1895, and married Lillian Gray of Winnebago County, Illinois, on June 20, 1898. Chicago Daily Tribune, March 18, 1895, p. 12.\n\nThe myth that Jarvie was self-taught, which appears to have been true until around 1907, was publicly dispelled once he became a member of the Artists Guild of Chicago. In the 1917 edition of the Guild\u2019s catalogue, Jarvie notes in his biography that he studied with one \u201cRyden,\u201d presumably Henning Ryder, a sculptor who taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Adams (1901), p. 97; Craftsman (1903), pp. 272\u201373.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago (1902\u20133), cats. 417\u201318. Jarvie initially referred to the green patination as a \u201cPermanent Green Finish\u201d in an advertisement in House Beautiful, 13, no. 1 (December 1902), p. XXX.\n\nJarvie regularly advertised candlesticks, beginning with his earliest known ad, the reproduction of his business card, in 1900: R. R. JARVIE, DESIGNER &amp; / MAKER OF LAMPS, LAMP / SHADES / CANDLESTICKS / &amp; LANTERNS, 276 SOUTH / HOMAN AVENUE, CHICAGO. House Beautiful 9\u201310 (November 1900), p. 712. For Jarvie as the Candlestick Maker, see his ad in House Beautiful, 8 (May 1903).\n\nThe Theta, Iota, Gamma, and Lambda candlesticks were exhibited at the Third Annual Exhibition of Original Designs for Decorations and Examples of Art Crafts Having Distinct Artistic Merit Art Institute of Chicago (1904), cats. 219\u201322. They were listed as designed and exhibited by R. R. Jarvie, Turner Brass Works, and Dawson Bros., makers. The Alpha and Beta models in base metals were in production by December 1903; Craftsman (1903), p. 275. The fifteen candlesticks appear in Jarvie\u2019s 1906 catalogue. See [glossary:Maher (1997)], pp. 31\u201345.\n\nFor illustrations of Preston\u2019s candlesticks, see Maher (1997), pp. 119\u201326. The socket of Preston\u2019s candlestick no. 1, although having a rough texture, could have been a source for Jarvie\u2019s Iota candlestick.\n\nModern silver-plated copies are known for the Alpha and Beta candlesticks.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Candlesticks, c. 1906.\n\nfig. 75.1 </section>",
