Their first collaboration in Zurich in 1979 set the tone for their future works, consisting of a photographic series of doll-scaled scenes where sausages, salami, and other processed meats become the protagonists of various situations and settings, including a car accident, a rug store, and a fashion show. The projects that Fischli/Weiss have made since then are characterized by a quirky sense of humor, a love of poetry, and a fascination for the mundane. </p><p>Learn more about Snowman by Fischli/Weiss on the Bluhm Family Terrace from April 27, 2017\u2013October 15, 2017.</p><p>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event.</p>",
