    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this enigmatic painting by the 18th century Venetian artist Piazzetta, a woman sits in a rocky, dramatic landscape.  The two men, like the woman, are clothes in a picturesque, or artistic, version of peasant dress.  They seem to rest from a walk, or perhaps from their day's work, and in the foreground a small boy steps tentatively toward the river, in which a duck rises, startled by two hunting dogs.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: This painting by Piazzetta has puzzled many scholars for many years.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: It has been suggested that the boy represents Christ as a child, or a young Bacchus, the Roman god of wine.  He does have a basket of grapes, after all.</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: Now, it's also been questioned whether we should understand the figures whose faces have a very realistic aspect as portraits of the artist's family.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: But the sensuality of the woman's direct gaze and revealing garment makes it seem unlikely that the artist would have portrayed his wife in such a way.  Whatever the meaning of the scene might be, its rich, warm coloring, theatrical charm, and bravura brushwork are typical of its Venetian origins.</p>\n",
