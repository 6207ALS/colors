Its unusual rounded format, which the artist employed sporadically throughout the 1850s and later abandoned, is highlighted by the circular arrangement of the figures, the overturned chair, and the table in the foreground. As with many of his other early drawings (see cats. 1\u20135), Whistler relied largely on crosshatching and an energetic, scribbled line to constitute his scene. His technique, however, varies greatly within the composition. In some areas, his use of line and shading is tight and controlled, while in others it is loose and sketchy. Some passages\u2014such as the rightmost male and female figures\u2014are treated in a detailed, three-dimensional manner, while others\u2014such as the bottom half of the female figure at left and her male companion\u2014look incomplete, their forms described mainly by outlines. Near the center of the drawing, line and shading disappear from the composition almost entirely, leaving the centermost woman\u2019s body undescribed from the chest down.\n\nThe lack of specification here and elsewhere creates considerable confusion regarding the spatial relationships between figures and objects, confusion that is intensified by the differing scales in which various parts of the drawing are rendered. There are other incongruities as well. Chiaroscuro effects that seem to originate from multiple light sources are carefully represented in the silhouetted male figure in the foreground and in the shadow cast by another male figure on the wall in the background, as well as in the play of light across the faces of the two rightmost figures. These dramatic lighting effects are completely ignored, on the other hand, in other sections of the composition. Such disparities give the drawing a distinctly improvisational quality. Whistler was clearly more concerned with setting and the placement of individual components in relation to the overall design than he was with maintaining a sense of naturalistic consistency. Yet despite its uneven treatment, the composition appears finished, with the artist\u2019s full signature inscribed along the lower right edge. Whistler\u2019s use of high-quality paper indicates that his ambitions for this work were greater than for many of his other early sketches. Concurrently with his early explorations of format and technique, Whistler also experimented with medium. Around the time he completed Scene from Bohemian Life, he also produced a lithograph with a similar subject and style, Engaged Man Sings . . . \u201cDearest Wilt Thou Then as Now?\u201d (fig. 6.1, [C 1]).\n\nThe drawing\u2019s composition has a strong narrative element, featuring all the trappings of bohemian life: young men and women are depicted socializing together in a casual setting, surrounded by humble furnishings, drinking and\u2014a sure marker of bohemian women\u2014smoking. Whether or not Whistler was inspired by Henri Murger\u2019s popular book Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de boh\u00e8me (1851), as some scholars have suggested, the comparison is apt. The circular format lends the image a vignette-like appearance; it is almost as if the viewer is peering in on the merry scene through a keyhole. Although the drawing pictures an invented scene in many ways reminiscent of illustrations commonly found in the popular press of the day, several aspects of the image have personal resonance for Whistler. A wide-brimmed hat with a ribbon hangs on the back wall, closely corresponding to the style of hat he wore around this time (see Whistler with a Hat, fig. 6.2; [K 54]). The setting is also, demonstrably, the home of an artist, as evidenced by the easel and the collection of small statuettes perched on a shelf that are visible in the background at left. A more directly autobiographical, closely related circular drawing from the same period, An Artist in His Studio (fig. 6.3; [M 211]), features a number of these artistic props.\n\nTogether, then, Scene from Bohemian Life and An Artist in His Studio imagine the home and studio of a young artist, and it is easy to see why this subject would have appealed to Whistler at the time. The years 1855\u201357 marked a major period of transition in his life; after false starts at West Point and the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, he moved to Paris in the fall of 1855 to actively pursue an artistic career for the first time. For the next several years he lived in the Latin Quarter, a center for artists and boh\u00e8mes in the city. Scene from Bohemian Life therefore bespeaks Whistler\u2019s wholehearted embrace of his new milieu. It is an image poised somewhere between idealization and reality, offering an undeniably romanticized view of the artistic lifestyle, yet one that rang true to the young Whistler\u2019s experience.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Scene from Bohemian Life corresponds to Margaret F.

Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell claim that Whistler had read Murger and \u201cknew Murger by heart before he came to Paris.\u201d See E. R. and J. Pennell, The Life of James McNeill Whistler (London: William Heinemann; Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1908), 1:52\u201353.\n\nThe Pennells specifically note that during this period, \u201che [Whistler] was always drawing, in the manner of Gavarni, [with] the people and the scenes of the Quartier his subjects.\u201d Pennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 1:56.\n\nFor a written description of the hats Whistler wore at this time, see Pennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 1:51.\n\nSome of these shared props also appear in two other early Whistler drawings of artists\u2019 studios: Artist\u2019s Studio (1854\u201355; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and Connoisseurs in a Studio (1854/55; private collection).\n\nThe Pennells provide an account of Whistler\u2019s early days in Paris and in the Latin Quarter; see Pennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 1:48\u201365. Many other biographies of Whistler exist; for a recent account of these years, see Daniel E. Sutherland, Whistler: A Life for Art\u2019s Sake (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2014), 39\u201350.
