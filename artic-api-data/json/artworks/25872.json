The artist painted at least six versions of the bridge over the course of six years; however, its shape is slightly different in each work. Twachtman may have altered the actual bridge or simply changed its appearance in each painting. Loosely rendered with feathery brushstrokes of green and rich brown, and incorporating expanses of unprimed canvas, this scene captures the rapid growth and verdant blossoming of spring.</p>\n",
