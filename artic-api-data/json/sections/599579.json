Robinson, 1949.1119\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Colorless glass, slightly bubbly. Blown in an open mold with wheel-abraded decoration. The rim is cracked off, slightly ground, with a short, flaring mouth. The convex sides taper into a flattened bottom that is slightly kicked and has no pontil mark. There is a wheel-abraded line below the rim; two more lines divide the vessel roughly into thirds: the upper line is thicker and more heavily abraded. For a zoomable image, see fig. 114.1.\n\nThe rim is broken and repaired; a small segment is missing. There are patches of thin, milky weathering crust on the interior with overall slight iridescence and some pitting.\n\nThis is a well-known form among Roman glasses of the first and early second centuries A.D. It is a later variation of Clasina Isings\u2019s form 32 but with straight sides and no indentations.\n\nA beaker with almost identical profile and wheel-cut decoration is in the National Museums Scotland, from a tomb at Mount Carmel. A similar one was found in France; both are illustrated by a profile drawing. There are further examples in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Toledo Museum of Art.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 47, form 32a, with examples that are later than the first and early second century A.D.\n\nSee Lightfoot, Ancient Glass in National Museums Scotland, p. 75, no. 157, citing Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 129, no. 106c, but this is a fourth-century-A.D. profile and is not as elegant as the beakers discussed here.\n\nFoy and Nenna, Tout feu tout sable, p. 184, no. 314, from the necropolis of Pauvadou, tomb 93, Fr\u00e9jus, France, second half of the 1st or 2nd century A.D.\n\nIsraeli, Ancient Glass in the Israel Museum, p. 160, no. 161, 1st/2nd century A.D.\n\nToledo Museum of Art, acc. no. 1923.1169.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 114 Beaker or Cup, probably 1st/early 2nd century A.D.\n\nfig. 114.1 Beaker or Cup (probably 1st/early 2nd century A.D.).
