    "description": "<p>The artistic talent of Suellen Rocca (born Suellen Krupp) was recognized early on when her third-grade teacher recommended that she enroll in members-only art classes at the Art Institute of Chicago. These were multilevel fine art courses in which students drew from live models and were encouraged to keep diaristic sketchbooks. Rocca entered the School of the Art Institute of Chicago at just 16, having won a scholarship. She studied with Ray Yoshida, who became an important mentor and lifelong friend.</p><p>Soon after graduation, Rocca joined forces with five other recent graduates of the School of the Art Institute to form the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/114577/the-hairy-who-art-green-gladys-nilsson-jim-nutt-jim-falconer-suellen-rocca-and-karl-wirsum\" target=\"_blank\">Hairy Who</a> in 1965.

Over a period of four years they transformed the art landscape of Chicago, injecting&nbsp;their new and unique voices into the city\u2019s rising national and international profile.</p><p>The only Hairy Who artist to graduate with a minor in printmaking, Rocca\u2019s drawings, paintings, and prints feed off one another, and she considers her works in all media to be of equal value to her art-making practice.</p><p>During the Hairy Who years, Rocca\u2019s visual vocabulary expressed her personal taste as much as her experiences as a newlywed and young mother. She employed signs and symbols drawn from everything from the rebus-like pictograms in kindergarten reading primers to the jewelry trade catalogs in her husband\u2019s family\u2019s store. Often characterized as \u201cpicture writing,\u201d Rocca\u2019s work maintains a sense of immediacy. In both its grid-like arrangements of repetitive glyphs punctuated by onomatopoeic words such as ohh, ahh, and eek, and the centrally located imagery framed by decorative borders, Rocca\u2019s intuitive and nebulous compositions stand apart from other Hairy Who work.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/2722/hairy-who-1966-1969\" target=\"_blank\">2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute\u2014the first-ever major survey dedicated solely to the Hairy Who\u2014explored how the group\u2019s distinct aesthetic transformed the art landscape of Chicago.</p>",
