    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The subject of this sculpture would have been instantly familiar to any reasonably well-read person in the 1850s. Here to give us the background is Brandon Rude, from the Art Institute's Department of American Art.<br>Brandon Rude:  Nydia was a fictional character from Edward Bulwer-Lytton's immensely popular 1834 novel, The Last Days of Pompeii. In that story Nydia, the blind girl, was in love with Glaucus.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: And as Vesuvius erupted, she attempts to search for her companions using her astute hearing as her guide. You can see her bent over, her left hand covering her right ear to sharpen her senses. And then her stick guiding her along the way as the city, Pompeii, crumbles around her, evidenced by the broken column capital at her right foot.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The subject, with its message of virtue and self-sacrifice, was so popular with Victorian viewers that Randolph Rogers produced almost a hundred versions of it in various sizes. A visitor to the sculptor's workshop in 1869 commented, &quot;I went to his studio and saw seven Nydias all in a row, all listening, all groping, and seven Italian marble-cutters at work, cutting them out. It was a gruesome sight.&quot;</p>\n",
