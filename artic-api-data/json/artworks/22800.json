    "description": "<p>Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, George Bellows studied at the New York School of Art, along with Edward Hopper and Rockwell Kent. He became one of the leading realist painters of his time and was also a masterful draftsman. His energetic drawings and lithographs\u2014often rendered on a large scale, as in the examples shown here\u2014suggest a spontaneous approach, though they also reveal his dedication to theoretical studies of proportion. This haunting yet spirited mixed-media drawing served as a study for the lithograph <em>Dance in a Madhouse</em>, created some 10 yeas later.</p>\n",
