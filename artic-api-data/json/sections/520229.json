During his reign (138\u201361), 30 percent of all coinage minted was in honor of Faustina I, a proportion unparalleled in Roman numismatic history. DIVA, on the obverse of the coin, signifies that Faustina has been deified by act of the Senate\u2014on the very day she died. The commemoration of the imperial consort could give the appearance of a family dynasty even if there were no male heirs. In this instance, Faustina\u2019s daughter, Faustina the Younger, married Antoninus\u2019s adopted heir, Marcus Aurelius, in A.D. 145, long before his accession.\n\nThe Diva Faustina series is unprecedented in the history of Roman coinage. Her coins \u201cbehave like the coinage of a living ruler,\u201d frequently referencing current events. The reverse type of this coin is Aeternitas (Eternity), referring to the eternal memory of the now-deified empress. Aeternitas is among the earliest types in Faustina\u2019s honor, but on the tenth anniversary of her death it is reissued with a slight change (the globe moves from her hand to the base of the rudder). The constantly evolving coinage seems to reflect Antoninus\u2019s desire that her cult would not fade over time. In Roman iconography, personified virtues or qualities were often assimilated to other polyvalent female deities and virtues (see cat. 54, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Marcus Aurelius). On Faustina\u2019s coinage Aeternitas is linked to images of Providence, Juno, Ceres, Spes (Hope), Fortune (as here), and Faustina herself. Thus the inscription \u201ceternity\u201d seems to refer not to the image on the coin but to the eternal realm from which Faustina herself now steers the \u201cfortune\u201d of the world and oversees the well-being of the empire and its people.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This coin: Beckmann Diva Faustina die series 2, AC10/df34-a.
