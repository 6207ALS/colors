    "description": "<p>French architects Charles Percier (1764\u20131838) and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Leonard Fontaine (1762\u20131853) are widely credited with the development of the neo-classical Empire style. Appointed architectes du gouvernement by Napoleon in 1801, their architecture and interior design work can be found in many of the monuments of Napoleonic Paris. Percier and Fontaine also authored numerous books on architecture and design throughout their partnership. The Art Institute of Chicago purchased Fontaine\u2019s library in 1927, which included original architectural drawings and prints that are now held in the Ryerson and Burnham Archives. The early drawings are primarily by Fontaine\u2019s nephew, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Louis Fontaine, and include examples of his architectural work at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and his studies of classical antiquities in Italy and Greece. The later drawings reflect both Fontaines\u2019 work in reshaping Paris under Napoleon III and the younger Fontaine\u2019s own architectural work throughout France. Only a few examples of Percier\u2019s original drawings are included in the collection. The prints are primarily published plates of classical and renaissance architecture in Italy and annotated studies of the redevelopment of Paris under Napoleon III. The purchase also included more than two hundred books and published portfolios documenting Percier and Fontaine\u2019s architectural work, their interest in antiquities and historical design styles, and the rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III. The books are held in the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries.</p>\n<p>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Percier%20and%20Fontaine%20collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1&quot;&quot;&gt;View finding aid.</a><br>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Percier%20and%20Fontaine%20collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1&quot;&quot;&gt;View selected images from this collection.</a><br>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;https://www.artic.edu/node/1056&quot;&quot;&gt;Detailed Collection Description.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
