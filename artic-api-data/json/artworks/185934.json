    "description": "<p>Joseph Ritter von F\u00fchrich was a fresco painter and draughtsman active in Rome with the Nazarene Brotherhood, who preferred a style of drawing that employed expressive outline and clarity of detail reminiscent of Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Raphael. F\u00fchrich designed illustrations for several religious themed books, including an edition of Ludwig Tieck\u2019s play <em>The Life and Death of Saint Genoveva</em> (1799/1800), which was based on a medieval legend of innocence betrayed. In the play, Genoveva is wrongly accused of being unfaithful by her husband, a character likely based on the 13th-century Duke Ludwig II of Bavaria. Robert Schumann\u2019s only opera was based on Tieck\u2019s play and was first performed in Leipzig in 1850.</p>\n",
