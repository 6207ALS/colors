    "description": "<p>Educated at Yale University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Shaw (1869\u20131926) established his architectural practice in Chicago in 1894. As a facile designer in the eclectic historical styles popular at the beginning of the 20th century, Shaw attracted a clientele drawn from Chicago\u2019s society and business leaders, including the Donnelleys, Ryersons, Rosenwalds, Swifts, and Wards. His architectural designs were based on detailed observations of buildings during frequent trips to Europe which he carefully recorded in his sketchbooks. Shaw received the American Institute of Architects\u2019 Gold Medal in 1926. His projects are documented in drawings, photographs, correspondence, and travel diaries and sketchbooks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Shaw,%20Howard%20van%20Doren,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Shaw,%20Howard%20van%20Doren,%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Shaw,%20Howard%20Van%20Doren/field/creato;%20additi;%20contri/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Find all Howard van Doren Shaw digital images.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
