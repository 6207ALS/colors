    "description": "<p>Print developed from Vincent van Gogh\u2019s <em>Self-Portrait</em><em>,</em>&nbsp;1887 from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p>Van Gogh created at least twenty-four self-portraits during his two-year stay in the energetic French capital. This early example is modest in size and was painted on prepared artist\u2019s board rather than canvas. Its densely dabbed brushwork, which became a hallmark of Van Gogh\u2019s style, re?ects the artist\u2019s response to Georges Seurat\u2019s revolutionary pointillist technique in&nbsp;<em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Image size:&nbsp;</strong>4.5 x 5.6875 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Full Size:</strong>&nbsp; 8 x 10 in.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Premium Cardstock</li>\n</ul>",
