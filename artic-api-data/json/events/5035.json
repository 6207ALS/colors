    "description": "<p>The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's \"Museums at Home<em>\"</em> series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based presentations and conversations to older adults. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>The circus is a grand spectacle full of daredevil acts, amusing clowns, and ferocious animals. At the end of the nineteenth century, many French artists became interested in portraying modern life and turned to the circus for inspiration. Art Institute volunteer lecturer Laura Davis will discuss works by Renoir, Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec, and Seurat depicting street circuses and scenes from the glamorous permanent circus venues in Paris. She will also examine works by American artists Beal and Curry, who drew inspiration from their French contemporaries and painted the revelry at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey circuses.</p><p>This presentation is offered as part of the Art Institute's <a href=\"/lifelonglearning\">Arts Insights</a> program. Art Insights provides enlightening art-enrichment experiences for older members of the community outside of the museum setting.</p><p>To register, please call (877) 797-7299, email <a href=\"mailto:coviaconnections@covia.org\">coviaconnections@covia.org</a>, or visit <a href=\"https://covia.org/services/well-connected/\" target=\"_blank\">Well Connected</a>.</p><p>This virtual presentation is hosted by Well Connected, a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who connect via phone- or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p>",
