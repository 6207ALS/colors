    "description": "<p>Saint Michael was one of the seven archangels of God in the Old Testament, and he led the heavenly host against God\u2019s enemies in the book of Revelation. This sculpture represents Michael\u2019s battle against Satan, who lies at his feet, pierced by the saint\u2019s lance. This subject would inevitably have been associated with the hope of salvation, since Saint Michael was often depicted weighing the souls of the blessed and the damned in images of the Last Judgment. This wood sculpture is a powerful example of the in\ufb02uence of trends from northern Europe on the art of Spain in the second half of the fifteenth century through the importation of works of art and craftsmen. The angular, dancing rhythm of the saint\u2019s pose and the tight, graphic quality of the details of his shield, hair, and wings may re\ufb02ect sources in northern European prints, such as the engravings of Master E. S. These elements would originally have been enhanced by a painted and gilded surface, which at some point was stripped away.</p>\n",
