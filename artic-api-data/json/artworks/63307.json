    "description": "<p>Johannes Regiomontanus published his secular bestseller, the 1474 <em>Calendar</em>, in Latin and German editions. Both include three scientific instruments used to measure time throughout Europe and a lunar volvelle diagram with a stack of moving dials. The final woodcut in the book is the more flexible universal dial shown here. The articulated brass arm with a modern string attached could be positioned to tell time at most European latitudes; it was definitely used, as the color beneath the arm is worn. Latin annotations throughout the volume show that it was consulted for nearly thirty years and used as a family chronicle to record the dates of birth and death of several children. The inscription under the universal dial comments at greater length on another death, possibly that of the writer\u2019s wife, as it is repeated elsewhere in the book: <em>In the year 1501 on October 23, died Christina Peterzaleni [. . .] may she rest in peace</em>.</p>\n",
