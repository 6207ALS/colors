    "description": "<p>Join artist Anneli Goeller for this art-making workshop using digital media and the Art Institute collection to generate your own poetry, and experiment with augmented reality. This workshop is designed for anyone who is comfortable using a computer.&nbsp;</p><p>Augmented reality enables users to exist in the same space as the 3D objects they create. This shared space is not fully digital, not fully physical, but is in between, and both. This workshop proposes that augmented reality can be a portal that opens a window onto a virtual world. A world that always exists, but which we need technology to access.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please note that in order to participate in this event, you will need to download </strong><a href=\"https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/download\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Spark AR Studio</strong></a><strong> to your computer ahead of time and will need to have a Facebook account.
