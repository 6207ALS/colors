Henri Matisse used a steel-nib pen to create the fluid lines; the reserve of ink made possible with this tool allowed him to follow the long contours of his model\u2019s body with minimal interruption. In some areas, however, such as the table edge, his intense focus on manually translating the forms he observed prevented him from noting the need to reload his pen. The various zones of marks that make up the composition\u2014from the short horizontals on the left and right, to the alternating floral and hatched lines in the upper middle, to the short verticals in the lower middle, to the zigzags in the right corner\u2014all converge at the center. There, we see the soft, curvilinear form of a nude female model resting on her stomach with her right arm covering her face and right leg slightly bent, laid out on a stage-like, round tabletop.\n\nTo be sure, it is a curious image in Matisse\u2019s output and is only slightly clarified by an additional version of the scene (fig. 18.1) and two related sheets (fig. 18.2 and fig. 18.3). The latter feature the same setting but a different female model in a similar raised-arm and bent-leg pose, but standing. The location is likely Matisse\u2019s Issy-les-Moulineaux studio, the subject of several large, painted \u201csymphonic interiors\u201d from 1911\u2014The Pink Studio (Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow), The Red Studio (Museum of Modern Art, New York), and Interior with Aubergines (Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble)\u2014and the drawings share a few of the same elements. For instance, the table is the same one as in Interior with Aubergines, and the fabric-covered screen and carpet can be found in The Pink Studio. Based on eyewitness accounts and historical documentation of Matisse\u2019s workplace (see fig. 18.4), however, we can confirm that the studio\u2019s beadboard wall covering had a vertical rather than horizontal orientation. Just as in the 1911 paintings, the artist employed his imagination and favored compositional inspiration over fidelity in the drawings of his studio, especially in the decorative components.\n\nStill, the recording of a woman lying facedown on a table\u2014especially in such an uncomfortable-looking pose\u2014is unexpected in Matisse\u2019s work. It might be informed by his contemporaneous sculpture Back (II) (1911[?]\u2013early Mar. or Apr. 1913, cast 1956; fig. 18.5). While it is generally accepted that Matisse began the second state of his bas-relief after he returned to Issy from Morocco in the spring of 1913, we have no way to document the full production dates of the sculpture, and over the years it has been variously ascribed to 1910\u201313, c. 1913\u201314, and c. 1914. There are no known historical documents to help firmly date the work, but a number of factors suggest that both Matisse\u2019s approach to the sculpture and the timeline of his efforts were themselves rather fluid. For example, a representation of a plaster Back is propped up against the wall on the far right of The Pink Studio. Painted in the same white and shadowy gray, blue, and green as the standing plaster cast to its left, it looks like Back (I) (fall 1909, cast 1950; fig. 18.6), but with a few notable differences. If the representation in The Pink Studio is accurate, it may show Back (I) early in its transformation into Back (II), as Matisse began adding plaster to solidify the form and chiseling down certain areas to straighten and firm up the figure. Seen in this context, the Art Institute\u2019s drawing\u2014with its careful delineation of fleshy contours pressed against a hard and unforgiving surface\u2014begins to find a place in his production and connects with a later sheet, Backs and Scene of Tangier (1912/13; fig. 18.7), that the artist executed during his February\u2013March 1913 stay in Morocco. With its similarly posed model, the drawing may be evidence of Matisse\u2019s continued thoughts about the works he left in Issy and what he aimed to complete upon his return.\n\nFemale Nude Lying Facedown on a Table also has an important place in the history of Matisse\u2019s reception in the United States. Alfred Stieglitz, the great gallerist, photographer, and promoter of modern art, was the first owner of the drawing, and he included it in his third solo presentation of Matisse\u2019s work at the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (\u201c291\u201d) in March 1912. More than four thousand people visited An Exhibition of Sculpture\u2014the First in America\u2014and Recent Drawings by Henri Matisse, which received mixed reviews. While most critics were skeptical of the twelve sculptures, they felt the dozen drawings proved Matisse\u2019s \u201cpower and individuality . . . as a draftsman.\u201d More noteworthy is the fact that in February 1913 Stieglitz lent the pen-and-ink drawing, along with another now in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (see cat. 13), to the landmark International Exhibition of Modern Art, also known as the Armory Show. Since Matisse was one of the first modern artists Stieglitz exhibited in his gallery, the artist\u2019s work was not a surprise to the majority of the New York art community, but it certainly was a shock for other visitors to the Armory Show. Much of the public response consisted of unfavorable commentary about his riotous color and childlike style and what they saw as his threat to \u201cturn . . . Humanity back to its brutish beginnings,\u201d a notion that Robert Winthrop Chanler\u2019s satiric painting Parody of the Fauve Painters (1913; Woodstock Artists Association and Museum Permanent Collection) makes abundantly clear. With its elegant black-and-white design and quiet installation in a discrete gallery dedicated to works on paper, Female Nude Lying Facedown on a Table did not garner much attention at the Armory Show. Stieglitz kept the unusual work in his collection until his death in 1946, when it was bequeathed to the Art Institute with the assistance of his widow, the artist Georgia O\u2019Keeffe.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew the composition directly with no changes using pen and black ink on tan wove sketchbook paper. It appears that he employed a metal-nibbed dip pen that allowed for the fluid, calligraphic marks in the background (see fig. 18.8). The pen held enough ink that the artist could draw even, continuous lines for the figure. In a few areas, as the pen ran out of ink and more pressure was applied, the slit in the nib opened, leaving two parallel lines. This is most evident along the uppermost contour of the tabletop (see fig. 18.9). Matisse extended the composition to the edges of the paper. The sheet, from a sketchbook, retains its original dimensions. There are pinholes at the upper left and right corners, which may indicate the artist pinned up the drawing at some point.\n\nThe sheet is dry mounted to smooth Japanese mitsumata paper (see fig. 18.10). Dry mount tissue is visible at magnification 80\u00d7 along the lower edge of the primary support (see fig. 18.11). The Japanese paper creates a 1 cm border around the primary support. It was once dry mounted to another sheet of off-white paper, which has been removed. Dry mount tissue is visible on the verso of the lower left corner of the Japanese paper; off-white fibers from a former tertiary support are embedded in it (see fig. 18.12). The long Japanese paper fibers of the secondary support were raised and disturbed when the tertiary support was removed. While the 1 cm secondary support border, dry mount adhesive, and evidence of a former tertiary support call to mind the mounts of other works from the period mounted by Eug\u00e8ne Druet, the use of Japanese paper for the secondary support suggests that it is not part of this group. Instead this drawing may have been mounted in New York in preparation for Matisse\u2019s 1912 exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s gallery, 291. An invoice dated June 12, 1913, from Stieglitz\u2019s framer, George Of, to Stieglitz (fig. 18.13) indicates Of provided the service of dry mounting prints to Japanese paper. \u201cMount 5 prints on mtd Jap paper / 18 1/2 \u00d7 25 @ 55 \u00a2 / Dry mount 1 pict. on mtd Jap. Paper.\u201d\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower left, in pen and black ink) (fig. 18.14).\n\nPen and black ink.\n\nThe primary support is medium-thick, smooth, tan wove paper. The paper tone is even, yet at magnification 4\u00d7 many brown fibers and extraneous inclusions are visible. The discolored fibers suggest the sheet contains some percentage of wood pulp. The top edge is jagged and uneven where it was torn from a sketchbook. Indentations from sewing holes from the sketchbook binding are evident 6.3 cm from the right and left edges. The other three edges are straight cut. This is the original sheet size. Microscope examination reveals ink extends over the left and lower edges.\n\nThe secondary support is medium-thick, cream Japanese paper. The surface is smooth and lustrous. The sheet is semitransparent. Transmitted-light imaging reveals long fibers distributed in uneven clumps (see fig. 18.15). Across the verso (fig. 18.16) the paper fibers are raised and disturbed (see fig. 18.12). This resulted when the tertiary support was removed. Analysis indicates the sheet is made from mitsumata fiber with a small percentage of softwood fibers.\n\nPrimary support: 24 \u00d7 31.5 cm (9 7/16 \u00d7 12 3/8 in.); secondary support: 26.1 \u00d7 33.5 cm (10 1/4 \u00d7 13 1/4 in.).\n\nA tertiary support was removed manually prior to entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. There is no record of conservation treatment since.\n\nThe upper edge and upper left corner are uneven, the result of tearing the sheet out of a sketchbook. There is a crease or tear across the upper right corner, which is secured by the attachment to the secondary support. There is a dark pinpoint spot in the center of the sheet, within the torso of the figure.\n\nFibers on the verso of the secondary support have been raised and disturbed from the tertiary support removal. Some areas have been skinned. Brown dry mount tissue residue with off-white paper fibers embedded in it remains in the lower right corner on the verso. There are minor handling dents in the secondary support border, which are evident in raking light.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold to Alfred Stieglitz (Jan. 1, 1864\u2013July 13, 1946), New York, for $20 by Mar. 14, 1912\u2013July 13, 1946.\n\nBy descent to Alfred Stieglitz Estate, New York, July 13, 1946\u2013Nov. 9, 1949.\n\nBequeathed to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 9, 1949.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession at 291 Fifth Avenue, An Exhibition of Sculpture\u2014the First in America\u2014and Recent Drawings by Henri Matisse, Mar. 14\u2013Apr. 6, 1912.\n\nNew York, Armory of the 69th Infantry, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Feb. 17\u2013Mar. 15, 1913, cat. 414, as Drawing; Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 24\u2013Apr. 16, 1913; Boston, Copley Society, Apr. 28\u2013May 19, 1913 (New York only).\n\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by Representative Modern Masters, Apr. 17\u2013May 9, 1920, cat. 159, as Drawing No. 7.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, History of an American, Alfred Stieglitz: \u201c291\u201d and After, July 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1944, cat. 56, as Nude Reclining, 1912.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Alfred Stieglitz, His Photographs and His Collection, Feb. 2\u201329, 1948, no cat.\n\nUtica, NY, Munson-Williams-Proctor Institute, 1913 Armory Show 50th Anniversary Exhibition, Feb. 17\u2013Mar. 31, 1963, cat. 414 (1 of 6) (ill.), as Reclining Nude, 1912; New York, Armory of the 69th Regiment, Apr. 6\u201328, 1963.\n\nWashington, DC, National Gallery of Art, Modern Art and America: Alfred Stieglitz and His New York Galleries, Jan. 28\u2013Apr. 22, 2001, pl. 12, as Female Nude Lying Face Down on a Table, 1912.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, New York et l\u2019art moderne: Alfred Stieglitz et son cercle [1905\u20131930], Oct. 18, 2004\u2013Jan. 16, 2005, cat. 56 (ill.), as Nu f\u00e9minin \u00e0 plat ventre sur une table, 1912; Madrid, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda, Feb. 10\u2013May 16, 2005 [as Nueva York y el arte moderno: Alfred Stieglitz y su c\u00edrculo [1905\u20131930]], as Desnudo feminine tendido boca abajo en una mesa [Nu f\u00e9minin \u00e0 plat ventre sur une table], 1912.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, Mar. 20\u2013June 20, 2010, cat. 17d (ill.), as Female Nude Lying Facedown on a Table, 1912\u201313; New York, Museum of Modern Art, July 18\u2013Oct. 11, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Association of American Painters and Sculptors, Inc., International Exhibition of Modern Art, exh. cat.

In all three drawings, however, the models\u2019 hair does not prevent study of the back.\n\nFor more on the studio, see John Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, including Remainder-Interest and Promised Gifts (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1978), pp. 86\u201389, 198\u2013200, esp. figs. 62, 64.\n\nOn the \u201csymphonic interiors,\u201d see Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Matisse: His Art and His Public (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1951), p. 151. In his excellent contribution to the study of Matisse\u2019s use of textiles in his work, Jack Flam has noted that between roughly 1907 and 1918 the artist altered decorative elements in his paintings and drawings and that \u201cthe compositional needs of the painting were given precedence over concerns about verisimilitude.\u201d See Flam, \u201cMatisse and the Metaphysics of Decoration,\u201d in Royal Academy of Arts, Matisse, His Art and His Textiles: The Fabric of Dreams, exh. cat. (Royal Academy of Arts, 2004), p. 41. The textile that inspired Matisse to replicate it in his drawings remains unknown.\n\nComplicating matters further are the circumstances of its exhibition and casting: while the plaster of Back (I) was first shown in London in 1912, according to the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Matisse\u2019s sculpture two of the three subsequent states\u2014the plasters of Back (III) and (IV)\u2014were not shown until 1949, when they were misidentified as Back (II) and Back (III). The plaster of the true Back (II) was not exhibited during Matisse\u2019s lifetime and was seemingly forgotten; indeed, it was only discovered in the artist\u2019s Nice studio in 1955, the year after his death. Because of this, the casting dates of the Back sculptures are unusual: the first bronzes of Back (I, III, and IV) were made in 1950, while the first bronze version of Back (II) was not created until 1956. For more on this history, see Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cBack (II),\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 158\u201363; the preceding commentary is adapted from this entry.\n\nSee cat. 12 for more on Matisse\u2019s exhibitions at \u201c291.\u201d Further information on Matisse and Stieglitz as well as on the Armory Show can be found in John Cauman, \u201cHenri Matisse, 1908, 1910, and 1912: New Evidence of Life,\u201d in Sarah Greenough, Modern Art and America: Alfred Stieglitz and His New York Galleries, exh. cat.
