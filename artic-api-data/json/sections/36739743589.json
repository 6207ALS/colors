Ryerson Collection, 1933.1155\n\n</section>incorrect section number 135466 <section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) was painted on a pre-primed, no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size linen canvas. The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. A warp-thread match was detected with two other Monet paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection: The Customs House at Varengeville (cat. 35 [W1455], inv. 1933.1149) and Charing Cross Bridge, London (cat. 40 [W1527], inv. 1933.1150), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The painting has a richly textured surface, which is largely related to the fact that the final painting was executed on top of an earlier composition, which included a second smaller stack on the right side of the canvas. Open brushwork and a few small areas of interlayer cleavage between the two compositions reveal that the field and at least part of the background hills of the earlier composition consisted predominantly of bright green tones, suggesting that the earlier painting may not have been a winter scene. The artist then covered the green field with a layer of lead white\u2013rich paint. Where visible, it appears that a thin, dull-purple toning layer was applied over the white intermediate layer before the snow-covered field was painted. It appears that the final wheat stack was expanded on the left and right sides after the small stack was painted out of the composition. On the left side of the stack, brushwork unrelated to the final composition indicates the inclusion of one or more buildings in this area at an earlier stage of the painting. There are also brushstrokes that form a rough diagonal slope from around the middle of the final stack to the upper right edge of the painting. It is unclear whether these forms were associated with the earlier two-stack composition or whether they could be related to an even earlier composition.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 30.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet (lower right, in light reddish-brown paint) (fig. 30.2). Some of the underlying brushstrokes were still wet when the signature and date were applied, specifically, the pale blue strokes (fig. 30.3). Near the edges, these pale blue brushstrokes are directly over the ground layer and may represent final touches added to the corner just before the painting was signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 92 cm, which corresponds to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size stretcher.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 21.5V (0.8) \u00d7 23.4H (0.6) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was determined with two other Monet paintings: The Customs House at Varengeville (cat. 35 [W1455], inv. 1933.1149) and Charing Cross Bridge (cat. 40 [W1527], inv. 1933.1150).\n\nThere is mild cusping along the bottom, left, and right edges, and more pronounced and irregular cusping along the top edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1991 conservation treatment (see Conservation History) tacks spaced 3\u20134 cm apart, with paper interleaf.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced 5\u20137 cm apart. Most of the holes correspond to the cusping pattern, except along the top edge where the cusping is more pronounced and the points of attachment seem to originate from beyond the cut edge of the canvas). There is a series of smaller pinholes around the edges, spaced approximately 3\u20134 cm apart (only present on the left side of the bottom edge, unless holes are present underneath the current tacks). The purpose and origin of these holes are not known.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Dates to the 1991 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); five-membered wooden stretcher with vertical crossbar, butt-ended mortise and tenon joints, keyable (no keys inserted). Depth: 3 cm\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1969-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. It was described as having five members including a horizontal (probably vertical, as in drawing) crossbar. Depth: Not documented.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThere is a ground layer that extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground ranges from approximately 20 to 120 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 30.4). Numerous bubble holes were observed in the ground layer (fig. 30.5).\n\nThe ground is off-white with some dark particles visible under magnification (fig. 30.6).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following components: lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of bone black, iron oxide, alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe infrared reflectogram clearly shows that the artist originally included another smaller wheat stack on the right side of the painting. This stack was set farther back in the composition than the large stack in the final painting, and it extended up into the area currently occupied by the buildings (fig. 30.7). The painted-out stack is difficult to see in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images, which may indicate that it was not built up very far. Breaks in the upper paint layers reveal dark blue-gray and brownish paint underneath, which may indicate the general tone of the stack, as far as it was developed (fig. 30.8, fig. 30.9, fig. 30.10).\n\nThroughout the field, breaks in the brushwork and a few small losses in the upper paint layers resulting from interlayer cleavage provide glimpses of paint from the earlier composition and indicate that the painting originally had a different color scheme. Losses near the left, right, and bottom edges reveal bright green and yellowish-green paint layers underneath the snow-covered field (fig. 30.11, fig. 30.12, fig. 30.13). Similar bright green was observed in the layers underneath the buildings on the right side of the canvas. Other hues observed from the underlying painting (although not as prevalent as the green tones) include pale orange, pink, and gray as well as a very dark brown tone to the right of the stack in the final painting (fig. 30.14). The presence of these bright colors may indicate that the earlier composition was not a winter scene. An area of the green paint, exposed at a loss near the right edge (fig. 30.15), was analyzed with X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and was found to contain the copper-and-arsenic-containing pigment emerald green. This bright green was not detected in the upper layers of the painting. PLM analysis also detected emerald green in lower paint layers (fig. 30.16) but not in any other samples taken from representative areas of the final composition. These findings suggest that the pigment was used only in the earlier composition. A buildup of textural brushwork unrelated to the final composition appears to be associated with a thick, brushy application of lead white\u2013rich paint in the foreground of the painting. Evidence of this layer is present to the right of the painted-out stack and in areas where the bright green underlayer is exposed (fig. 30.17). It does not, however, appear to be present underneath either the final or the painted-out stack. This may represent a kind of blocking-out layer that was aimed specifically at covering the bright green field of the earlier painting. Localized interlayer cleavage has occurred between the earlier composition and this intermediate layer, which appears to have been applied when the underlying painting was already surface dry, probably resulting in poor adhesion. Where the intermediate layer is visible at the edges of losses, it appears to be covered with a thin, dull purplish-gray layer, which seems to serve as a toning layer for the final composition (fig. 30.18, fig. 30.19, fig. 30.20). The edges of the paint losses often look quite soft, as if the paint was still somewhat fluid when the losses occurred. In at least one place\u2014a small loss near the lower right corner\u2014a later brushstroke curves over the edges of the paint loss, suggesting that the loss occurred while the artist was still working on the painting (fig. 30.21).\n\nIn the background area, at the left edge of the large stack, a series of distinct linear brushmarks, visible in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared (IR) images, seems to indicate that the artist originally painted some architectural forms in this location (fig. 30.22). Other brushwork unrelated to the final composition includes a series of radio-opaque strokes that form a diagonal, running from approximately the center of the final stack to the upper-right edge of the painting (fig. 30.23). It is unclear whether these forms were associated with the earlier composition that included the smaller stack or whether they may have been part of an even earlier composition.\n\nIn the process of painting the final composition, some modifications were made to the large wheat stack. The X-ray indicates that the stack was originally significantly smaller, possibly with its peak positioned further to the right (fig. 30.24). It was then subsequently expanded along the left and right sides. The stack appears to have been planned from early on in the painting of the final composition, and it is possible that it coexisted (in its earlier, smaller incarnation) with the small, painted-out stack at some point. The smaller dimensions of the stack were in place in the final composition, when the snowy landscape in the distance was painted around it, including the hills, trees, and buildings, which were added on top of the painted-out stack. The blue hills and the screen of trees behind the final stack can be seen to continue underneath the edges of the stack up to its original borders in the X-ray and detail images (fig. 30.24, fig. 30.25). On the right side of the painting, brushstrokes that do not correspond to the final composition seem to indicate that some adjustments were made to the buildings: the roof of the building farthest to the right appears to have originally extended further to the right, and a strong horizontal stroke near the right edge may have been related to another building that was ultimately not included in the final composition (fig. 30.26). The paint of the sky is quite thickly built up, making it difficult to see the underlying layers (fig. 30.27). Most of the surface consists of a fairly continuous wet-in-wet paint application.\n\nOverall, the paint layer has a rich, textural surface, with thick brush-marked strokes and areas of low impasto, the texture coming from the two superimposed compositions as well as the intermediate layer applied to much of the foreground (fig. 30.28). For the most part, the paint has a relatively dry, stiff, paste-like consistency, with a predominantly matte surface finish. Some areas, such as the expanded left edge of the stack, appear more fluid with wet-in-wet paint application, the brushstrokes of which have settled out to some degree, resulting in a slightly smoother surface and suggesting that the artist added extra medium to the paint (fig. 30.29). Some of the final touches added to the painting include the reddish-brown trees in the background (fig. 30.30) and the colored diagonal strokes applied over the surface of the snow, which consist largely of dry brushstrokes that deposited mainly on the high points of the underlying paint texture (fig. 30.31). A deep ridge along the right edge of the painting seems to have occurred when the paint was still soft and may be related to framing or some kind of transport device (fig. 30.32).\n\nBrushes including 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). A few brush hairs are embedded in the paint surface.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence indicates the liberal use of red lake throughout the landscape (fig. 30.33).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1991 and selectively varnished with dilute Arkon-P90 to saturate areas of localized blanching in the wheat stack only (see ). The paint surface has a relatively dry, matte quality in most areas. It is noted in the conservation file that a natural-resin varnish (estimated) was removed in 1969; the origin of that varnish is not known.\n\nIn 1969, yellowed varnish and overpaint were removed. The painting was wax-resin lined and restretched on an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 1991, the AYAA and methacrylate varnish layers applied in 1969 were removed. Residues of starch-paste adhesive from the 1969 treatment were removed mechanically after the residues had been dampened. The wax-resin lining was removed. The canvas was edge lined and mounted on a tongue and groove stretcher prepared with a loose lining. Selective revarnishing of the wheat stack was carried out with dilute Arkon-P90, in order to minimize the effects of localized blanching after the varnish removal. Minor scattered inpainting was carried out.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas was edge lined and loose lined in 1991 after removal of the wax-resin lining that had been applied in 1969. The canvas is stretched flat and taut on the stretcher. There is some loss and abrasion in the ground layer on the original tacking margins. The paint layer has a rich, textural surface. A few small areas of interlayer cleavage in the field and the sky appear to be old and seem to be due to poor adhesion between the upper paint layers and the earlier composition. There is localized retouching associated with some of these losses. There is some flattening of thicker paint and dark accretions around the edges, which appear to be the result of framing while the paint was still soft. There is a general network of age cracks; this is most noticeable in the sky, which has a slightly quilted appearance. In addition, there are fine, slightly opened drying cracks in the upper layers of the wheat stack, revealing light-colored paint beneath. There are some starch-paste residues in the recesses of the paint texture. The painting is currently unvarnished, except for the localized application of Arkon P-90 on the upper part of the stack, which was applied to deal with blanching issues. Overall, the paint surface is relatively matte, with some slight variations in sheen across the surface.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995: this frame was originally on The Customs House at Varengeville [transferred in 1995] (cat. 35): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), late-nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel R\u00e9gence, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches and fillet liner. The frame is both water and oil gilded. Red-brown bole was used on the perimeter, cast foliate ornament on the face and sight molding, and the liner. Red bole was used for the scotia sides. The gilding was applied directly to the plaster on the ogee face in the crosshatched areas between the ornament. The quadrillage face has been rubbed to bring out the white of the plaster. The frame has an overall bronze tone with casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes. The frame has a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back. All back and interior surfaces have been overpainted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized cast dovetail-pierced egg-and-flower molding; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 30.34).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed 1995) The work was previously housed in a twentieth-century reproduction of a R\u00e9gence frame with swept sides and foliate rocaille cartouches (fig. 30.35, fig. 30.36).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 9, 1891, for 2,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Oct. 25 or Nov. 16, 1892.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

[Minneapolis Society of Fine Arts, 1915], p. 44, cat. 255).\n\nThe painting was dated 1890/91 by James N. Wood and Douglas Druick; see Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, Mar. 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. This range includes the inscribed date of 1891 and allows for the possibility that Monet began the painting in 1890.\n\nFor further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (normal light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination, indicates that the paint mixture includes lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, and cobalt blue; other pigments may also be present in the mixture. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_33\\_1155\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings examined for this project, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a more sketchy state, with areas of ground left exposed. John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171, notes that \u201cMonet\u2019s stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 . . . insisted on several occasions that, in the studio, \u2018[Monet] signed his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 13, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (W1281/1933.1155),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1281, W1455, W1527,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe more pronounced cusping on the top edge is probably primary cusping related to the attachment of the larger roll of fabric (from which this canvas was cut) to the commercial priming frame (see Ground Application/Texture).\n\nThe presence of a Durand-Ruel label suggests that the stretcher was either original or was added early in the painting\u2019s lifetime.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, treatment report, Aug. 26, 1969, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nMicrofossils were identified by PLM and SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 13, 2014.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 13, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Jan. 28, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stacks\\_33\\_1155\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA similar change in palette was observed in Stack of Wheat (cat. 31 [W1283], inv. 1983.29), where passages of bright green and red paint were observed underneath the snowy landscape as well as bright blue underlayers in the sky.\n\nThe copper and arsenic from the underlying green paint was probably not detected in spectra collected from the surface of the painting because of the lead white\u2013rich layer that was broadly applied on top of the earlier composition. It should be noted, however, that spectra were collected from select areas of the painting and it cannot be ruled out that emerald green could be present in areas of the final painting that were not analyzed. Green areas related to the final painting that were analyzed were found to contain viridian (a green pigment that contains chromium). See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_33\\_1155\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 9, 2011; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Jan. 28, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Fig Caption: Photomicrograph of a cross section of the paint and ground layers of Monet\u2019s Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (1890/91) showing a green layer that contains emerald green from an earlier painting stage. Original magnification: 200x. The Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.1155.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). Emerald green was detected only in paint layers that appear to be associated with the earlier composition. PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 13, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1155\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Jan. 28, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_33\\_1155\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washignton, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
