Here, a fashionably dressed woman sits alone and alert. Her presence is a sign of modern Paris\u2019s changing social environment, in which caf\u00e9 culture offered women new opportunities for leisure in public spaces. Although Lungren employed a dense, hard-edged style, his interest in modern life and the effects of light (here both gas and electric lighting) was nevertheless indebted to French Impressionism.</p>\n",
