    "description": "<p>Ancient Mesopotamia was a geographical region near the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, often described as \u201cthe fertile crescent,\u201d that today encompasses parts of Iraq, Iran, Kuwait, and Syria. Early civilizations flourished in the area from around 10,000 BCE, and would go on to develop agricultural practices around the year 5000 BCE and continue to advance and adapt in the region for a further 5,700 years.</p><p>Given this timeline, the term ancient Mesopotamian can be used to describe artworks originating from a broad range of geographical and chronological points, rather than a definable civilization or artistic tradition. More specific attributions are often also made, though they can be difficult to prove without archaeological context.</p><p>Scholars believe the rare and enigmatic Mesopotamian statuette in the Art Institute\u2019s collection was produced by the proto-Elamite culture around 3000\u20132800 BCE. However, a lack of detailed archaeological context makes that origin difficult to prove. The more general term ancient Mesopotamian is thus used to convey a certain level of ambiguity.</p>",
