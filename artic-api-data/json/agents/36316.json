    "description": "<p>Artist Christina Ramberg is best known for her acrylic on Masonite (or board) paintings featuring stylized fragments of the female figure. In <em>Loose Beauty</em>, Ramberg contrasts intricately detailed intimates with the tightly cropped forms of silhouetted anatomy. Throughout her lifetime, the artist\u2019s output was driven by her manipulation of external, patterned surfaces\u2014such as satin and lace\u2014and the internal structures they were draped over, stretched across, or bulging out of.</p><p>Ramberg studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) where she grew close with fellow classmates <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/60857/philip-hanson\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Hanson</a> (whom she eventually married), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33774/roger-brown\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Roger Brown</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/105026/eleanor-dube\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eleanor Dube</a>. Together these four friends exhibited at the Hyde Park Art Center (HPAC) on Chicago\u2019s South Side as the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/search?q=%22false+image%22\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">False Image</a> in 1968 and 1969.</p><p>Along with fellow HPAC alums who had formed the groups <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/114577/the-hairy-who-art-green-gladys-nilsson-jim-nutt-jim-falconer-suellen-rocca-and-karl-wirsum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hairy Who</a> and Non-Plussed Some, they would soon be labeled Chicago Imagists, a movement defined by its formal clarity, stylized figuration, and references to Surrealism and popular culture. However, Ramberg\u2019s gripping yet enigmatic aesthetic was distinct, transcending that of her Imagist peers. Whether representing figurative or abstracted forms, she methodically experimented with various approaches to shape and structure, most vividly evident in copious <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/154853/untitled\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study drawings</a>.</p><p>Ramberg drew inspiration from artwork she saw in exhibitions at the Art Institute\u2014such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/6509/navajo-blankets-and-contemporary-navajo-rugs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Navajo (Din\u00e9) Blankets</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/5992/sculpture-of-polynesia\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Sculpture of Polynesia</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/6546/persian-and-indian-miniatures-from-the-collection-of-everett-and-ann-mcnear-a-promised-gift\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Persian and Indian Miniatures</em></a>\u2014as well as work she collected from self-taught artists <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40896/joseph-yoakum\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Joseph Yoakum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/55205/lee-godie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Godie</a>, and \u201ctrash treasures\u201d she collected at Chicago\u2019s Maxwell Street Market.</p><p>Ramberg participated in every major Imagist exhibition held across North and South America, as well as the United Kingdom. Concurrently, she taught at colleges and universities around Chicago, most notably SAIC, where she eventually became chair of the painting department from 1985 to 1989.</p>",
