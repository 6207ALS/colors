Because the blocks were manufactured by adhering a number of small boxwood segments together\u2014sometimes as many as eighteen\u2014they could be taken apart where they naturally split, where the adhesive had weakened, or where Gauguin intentionally cut down a block into smaller pieces to carve into the other side. He reused at least three blocks in this manner; those for Te atua (The God) (cat. 53), Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), and Mahana atua (Day of the God) (cat. 80) were repurposed to produce additional wood-block matrices for printing.\n\nAlthough it is clear that Gauguin cut down some blocks before proceeding to carve new matrices on the other side, he is also known to have created multiple matrices on the back of a single undivided block. On the reverse of the long horizontal plank of wood used for Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (1894/95) (cat. 77), three matrices, albeit unfinished, appear. One is another version of Manau tupapau (cat. 78 [Kornfeld 30.3a]); the second is Maori Woman in the Forest (cat. 79 [Kornfeld 30.3b]); the third, Standing Maori Woman (Kornfeld 30.3c]) is not represented in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. Peter Zegers proposes that Oviri and Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (cat. 85 [Kornfeld 36]) were made on sections of the Te atua block (see cat. 52, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), while the authors of the 1988 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 propose that the original block for Te atua \u201cseems to have been broken at an early date and parts of it taken by Gauguin to Tahiti in 1895\u201d where the two works cited above were possibly \u201cengraved on the verso.\u201d\n\nCareful examination of impressions of Te atua reveal vertical and horizontal white lines that correspond to the joins and cracks between segments of the wood block. When a tracing is made to locate these segments, it is immediately clear that Gauguin flipped over the Te atua block, and starting from the left, he created Oviri, a composition that encompassed the first vertical segment of the block as well as an additional 43 mm of the second segment (fig. 84.1.2 top left, top right, and bottom left). In an uncut sheet of paper that Gauguin first used to print an impression of Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) on the recto (see cat. 57), he printed two impressions of Oviri side by side on the verso. In both, a single irregular white line is present along the left edge (fig. 84.1.3). Although the artist trimmed many impressions of Oviri, this line, printed in the white-line manner, is present in a number of them and would have been carved to the right of Oviri in the block. The singular emphatic line was clearly meant to separate Oviri from the composition that Gauguin would then produce adjacent to it (fig. 84.1.4). When he continued to carve the block further to the right, he created Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri, which extended another 42 mm to the right, reaching the right edge of the second vertical segment of the block. He incorporated much of Oviri\u2019s head and torso into this new composition (fig. 84.1.2 bottom left) (see cat. 85.2).\n\nUsing many of the same materials and printing strategies that the artist developed for his Noa Noa Suite (cats. 51\u201360), the impressions Gauguin pulled from these smaller wood-block segments continued to explore familiar Tahitian subjects and expanded to incorporate others such as Oviri, a goddess of death and mourning. The majority of impressions were pulled from a block that was first inked and printed in one color, then reinked and printed in another. The second printing was slightly skewed over the first to create a deliberate misalignment of the composition. Using a variety of papers, Gauguin produced impressions that have highly textured, irregularly inked surfaces in common. With the setting around the figure deliberately obscured by the monotype-like transfer of media from the block, Oviri emerges like a specter from an undefined ethereal space, the form\u2019s legibility deliberately limited in later-state impressions (see, for example, cat. 84.2, cat. 84.3, and cat. 84.4).\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 84.1.5).\n\nThe block was printed in black ink, which was very thinly and unevenly dispersed on the block; there are many deep-black passages throughout that appear to have been applied by hand onto the surface of the print over and adjacent to the inked passages. Additionally, a hair or thread embedded into the inked surface inadvertently prevented the ink from transferring to the paper and as a result, there appears a thin line that begins to the left of the figure and curls over her head (fig. 84.1.6). This line can easily be mistaken for an intended incision in the block rather than what is more likely an accidental occurrence.\n\nA unique feature of this impression is that a fragment of a pastel counterproof of Reclining Tahitian is printed on the back (cat. 70 [Field 1973 12]). The wet media partially soaked through and faintly toned the underlying paper blue and pink in random spots. Although these washes have now faded to a great extent, close examination of Oviri reveals faint blue passages to the left of the figure\u2019s arm and upper right thigh. Perhaps the reuse of the counterproof fragment to print this unique first-state impression was motivated by the lack of an adequate supply of paper and simultaneously inspired by the appearance of the colored media on the verso.\n\nThe support is a laminate of two pieces of Japanese paper that Gauguin adhered together. This practice was not unusual for the artist, and numerous impressions of wood-block prints and monotypes were made on supports composed of two Japanese paper layers (see also cat. 54.2 and cat. 59.2). It is this type of paper specifically that Gauguin used when he intended to brush watercolor additions onto his prints or when the transfer of media necessitated the application of water. Perhaps the artist found a single sheet of paper too thin and weak for his rigorous handling, and by adhering two sheets together he could create a more robust support for counterproofing his pastel. His choice of Japanese paper was also likely related to his intended results: the wetted pastel was readily absorbed into the lightly sized papers and easily feathered into soft passages of transferred color (fig. 84.1.7).\n\n204 \u00d7 117 mm (primary/secondary support)\n\nThis print appears to be a previously undocumented first-state impression. The development of the image follows a trajectory identical to that found in Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite and used continually throughout his printmaking career. Specifically, when the artist made his first cuts into the block, he would carve shallow gouges to produce the principal forms and lightly incise lines that he would return to and broaden in later states. In this impression, broad gouge strokes confidently establish the upper body and posture of Oviri, while fine incised lines articulate the legs, adjacent palm trees, and vegetation. Following the printing of this impression, it appears that Gauguin further developed the block in an additional state. Evidence of this found to date by this author includes reproductions of Oviri in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints and in a recent exhibition catalogue. In the second state, additional fine incising is visible in the face and between and under the breasts. Yet, in a number of impressions that can easily be mistaken as third-state impressions\u2014a group in which the majority of impressions fall\u2014the incising is no longer visible and delicate details are eliminated, not by further work on the block but rather by the manner in which the block was inked to significantly broaden the shallow gouged forms and to fill lightly incised lines with ink (fig. 84.1.8).\n\nThe fragmentary pastel counterproof pulled from Reclining Tahitian (cat. 70) merits mention here; see also the apt description and insightful discussion presented in entries written by Mel Becker Solomon and Peter Zegers, respectively (see Commentary and Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). Why Gauguin would cut down the large counterproof can only be surmised based on the spattering of a white material on the surface, perhaps paint that spilled across the sheet, which, given the fibrous nature of the support and the friability of the media, could not be readily removed. As noted above, the rarity of good-quality paper likely made reuse of this large sheet a necessity; however, an aesthetic decision may have been at play as well.\n\nUnder magnification there are many passages of lifted and abraded paper fibers that have distorted the surface. The way in which the paper fibers have lifted is indicative of partial adhesion to the block during the printing process as the paper was lifted away from the block. This likely happened because the paper was not damp enough and selectively stuck to the ink. Alternatively, the sheet could have been too wet to remove without leaving paper fibers behind. Whatever the cause, it appears that printing ink was directly hand applied on top of the lifted paper fibers and abraded areas after the impression was pulled from the block to restore a dark black tone through the vertical center of the composition (fig. 84.1.9). Both ink layers are insoluble in water; however, they are friable when tested under magnification. Examination under ultraviolet and infrared light enhances the difference in appearance of these inks. Regardless of the nature of the medium, there is no question that the artist added the ink by hand over the damaged paper fibers to restore the overall surface texture and tonality of the print.\n\nThe double-sided artwork is in stable condition overall. Over time, the sheet has darkened to a golden tone due to overexposure to light. Originally, the paper would have had an ivory tone, one that Gauguin favored. Small passages of wetted blue and pink pastel that wicked through the sheets would have been more pronounced and have since faded.  \nHarriet K.

Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine H. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), cat. 35.\n\nThe eleventh block that also carried the Kiessling stamp was used to carve Tahitian Idol\u2014the Goddess Hina (cat. 82). In addition to this and the ten blocks used for the Noa Noa Suite, Gauguin procured a block manufactured by attaching the wood segments with screws rather than adhesive. He used it to carve Mahana atua (Day of God) (cat. 80) in 1894/95 and later two images for issues of Le sourire (cat. 111 and cat. 120) on the verso. This block is also of fine quality and Gauguin may have purchased it at the same time that he purchased the eleven blocks manufactured by Kiessling.\n\nIt would not be unusual for a wood block to crack or for the adhesive to fail over time, given its tendency to expand and contract with seasonal changes in the environment. The majority of extant blocks exhibit some degree of cracking. However, it is interesting to note that a spline of wood was inserted into the Art Institute\u2019s block of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1 [Kornfeld 22]) by cutting a channel 1/8 in. high by 1/8 in. deep along the center of the block and running the spline along all sides. Splines are commonly used to prevent cupping or cracking in larger pieces of wood, particularly those that are constructed from glued-together segments, and although the addition of a spline to an original Gauguin wood block is unusual and not something that would be done today, it ultimately did preserve the block\u2019s structural integrity in this case.\n\nPrints from blocks that were cut down include Head of a Reclining Man (Kornfeld 37), Memory of Meijer de Haan (cat. 86), Young Maoris (cat. 87), and Two Maoris (cat. 88). See Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), nos. 37, 38, 39, and 40, respectively.\n\nSee Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 80.\n\nAn untrimmed impression of Oviri displayed in the exhibition Gauguin: Metamorphoses (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2014) provides another clear indication of the broad vertical line of demarcation that Gauguin gouged into the block to separate Oviri from the composition that he would produce adjacent to it. It is also the most legible example examined firsthand by this author of a second-state impression. It is printed in black ink and reveals every nuance of the incising, the breaks in the block, and the ring structure of the wood segments that comprise the block. See Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), p. 149, fig. 101.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThis state was not included in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the prints; Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W.

Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 152, cat. 35.\n\nA reproduction of a very legible second-state impression from a private collection appears in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), p. 149, fig. 101. Although it is not possible to determine with certainty from the descriptions listed in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 from which collection the reproduction in that publication derives, the closest description to it among the group appears to be that formerly from the Sainsere Collection, which was printed in two shades of ocher and is signed Gauguin in the lower left. Perhaps the location of the signature in the description is erroneous, since the signature in the print is centered along the bottom in the reproduction. Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 152, cat. 35.\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

Its placement indicates that it is one that the artist deliberately carved since it does not correspond to any existing joins between the segments. Bottom right, an impression of Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (1894) (see cat. 85) is reversed and superimposed alongside Oviri to demonstrate how the artist used part of his previous carving to create a new composition. The right edge of this small block would have corresponded to a join between two segments, making its boundary the result of a natural break in the matrix.\n\nfig. 84.1.3 Paul Gauguin (French, 1848\u20131903). Top, two impressions of Oviri (verso) (1894). Bottom, impression of Mahna no varua ino (recto) (1893/94) (cat. 57.2) printed by Louis Roy. The Kelton Foundation. In both impressions of Oviri, a pronounced line, created by carving deeply into the block, demarcates a border to the left of the figure. Gauguin trimmed many impressions to just inside this line so that it rarely appears in trimmed impressions.\n\nfig. 84.1.4 Detail of Gauguin\u2019s Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (1894) showing the line of demarcation that appeared along the left edge of Oviri, now centralized through the tree trunk that bisects the smaller composition, positioning Oviri on the right and the woman with raised arms on the left. Gauguin softened the rigidity of the line by adding alternating rounded gouge strokes to each side of the line.

Art Institute of Chicago, 1948.273R.\n\nfig. 84.1.7 Detail of Gauguin\u2019s Reclining Tahitian (1894) (cat. 70) showing how the wetted pastel absorbed readily into the Japanese papers that Gauguin laminated to create a support for the counterproof. Due to the natural separation of the two papers over time, the media are now visible in the center of the partially delaminated sheet.
