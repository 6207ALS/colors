    "description": "<p>Alfred Stieglitz worked tirelessly to elevate photography to a medium of art. He edited two journals, <em>Camera Notes</em> and <em>Camera Work</em>; ran a series of galleries where he promoted photography alongside modern painting and sculpture; and made groundbreaking photographs of his own. Stieglitz took this photograph from the back of a moving train as it pulled out of the train yard in Long Island City, New York, and the image was published in the first issue of <em>Camera Work</em> in January 1903. The elegance of the composition belies its rough, industrial subject and emphasizes artistic intent over the technical skills required to make a photograph. The title, too, affirms the artist's role in a mechanical process of urban transformation.</br>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n",
