    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Look towards the center of this round painting attributed to renaissance artist Raffaello Botticini. Nearly lost in this busy colorful scene the Christ child and his mother sit at the foot of a stairway leading underneath the arch of a pagan temple now in ruins. Here\u2019s Larry Feinberg, curator of European painting.</p>\n<p>LARRY FEINGERG: The subject has to deal with the adoration of the magi. It\u2019s basically a sort of royal courtesy of the foreign kings coming to visit this new divine king on earth.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The magi have arrived by this ship that you can see at the upper left of the painting. Among the many people their retinue are several animals associated at the time with the exotic east. Seated on a marble slab in the left foreground is a monkey on a leash. On the far right of the painting, to the left of the red figure on horseback is a giraffe. Look above the giraffe to find a peacock perched on a wooden beam.</p>\n<p>LARRY FEINBERG:  Peacocks since medieval times were often associated with Christ because it was believed that after it died its flesh never decayed. And so that became a symbol of Christ\u2019s immortality.</p>\n",
