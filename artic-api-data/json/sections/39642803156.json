This is also the fourth issue in which Gauguin replaced the word s\u00e9rieux with m\u00e9chant (\u201cwicked\u201d) in the title, a term he adopted to underscore its role as a purely satirical journal. Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created a satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897. So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. Gauguin hoped to use the mimeograph machine to print images and text simultaneously (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text of the August, September, and October 1899 issues were rendered partially illegible due to the broken lines and uneven printing. In this issue of the journal, all of the illustrations were produced as wood-block prints. The artist\u2019s initials are legible in the lower left.\n\nAn impression of Composition with a Turkey adorns the front page. An excess of linseed oil is indicated by the migration of the binder in the black printing ink into the paper. This is visible as dark brown discoloration and strike-through on the verso as well as on the sheet facing it. The rest of the issue was printed by applying brownish-black ink through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself is responsible for the grainy appearance of the text (see Technical Overview). The mimeograph ink also contained an excess of oil, which has resulted in golden brown haloes and significant strike-through.\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125)\n\n318 \u00d7 505 mm (full sheet); 318 \u00d7 253 mm (folded sheet); 265 \u00d7 165 mm (image)\n\nIn 1948, when the issue entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection, there was a thick paper guard adhered along the left edge of the pages that mistakenly identified it as the spine edge of the issue. It also made opening the issue impossible. It was removed, and toned Japanese paper was used to properly reattach the pages along the right edge restoring its original format. Cellophane tapes were removed along the central folds of the title page as well.\n\nThe issue is in fair condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
