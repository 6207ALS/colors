    "description": "<p>Immediately north of the Chicago River, the increasingly dense development of both residential and commercial properties after World War I concentrated too much traffic on Michigan Avenue. The Lake Shore Drive and Link Bridge, completed in October 1937, was built to relieve this congestion. The bridge and its approaches were the first projects in Chicago completed under the auspices of the Public Works Administration. This presentation album contains large-format construction and finished photographs. The handsome, classically detailed bridge was destroyed in the re-design of Lake Shore Drive in the 1990s.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Lake%20Shore%20Drive%20Outer%20Drive%20and%20Link%20Bridge%20Photograph%20Album/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Lake%20Shore%20Drive%20Outer%20Drive%20and%20Link%20Bridge%20Photograph%20Album/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View entirely digitized collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
