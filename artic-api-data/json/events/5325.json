The program will be recorded and available on the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s YouTube in the near future.</strong></p><p>When first created, ancient Greek, Etruscan, and Roman sculptures did not look the way that we see them in museums today. Their surfaces\u2014now mostly plain marble\u2014were instead enriched by layers of paint. Polychromy, a term derived from the Greek for \u201cmany colors,\u201d refers to the application of this paint, which ancient viewers believed enhanced the significance and beauty of the work. Like form, color was one of the most important elements of ancient sculpture.</p><p>In most cases, only microscopic traces of the ancient paint survive, making it difficult to reconstruct the original appearance of these sculptures. As a result, it is important to separate evidence from speculation in our interpretations of polychromy on ancient sculptures. Thanks to modern technology, research into ancient literary sources, and comparison to works in a variety of media, conservators, scientists, and art historians have been uncovering more of the complexity of painting techniques in ancient art. Beyond attempting to understand ancient color, this research can also enhance our knowledge in other areas, including how ancient Mediterranean peoples represented themselves, their heroes, and their gods through painted sculpture.</p><p>This program features the insights of Mark Abbe, an expert on ancient polychromy, and curator Katharine Raff and conservation scientist Giovanni Verri, who will reveal findings of their recent research into the polychromy of works in the museum\u2019s collection.</p><p><strong>About the Speakers</strong></p><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer, and downloading the latest version of <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a> to enjoy this program.
