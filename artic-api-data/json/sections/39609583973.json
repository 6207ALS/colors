There are four iterations of this image: the gouache and watercolor that served as the matrix (fig. 66.2) and three counterproofs: one in the Art Gallery of Ontario (fig. 66.3) and the two under discussion here.\n\nFran\u00e7oise Heilbrun was the first to relate the composition to a photograph attributed to the French photographer Charles-Georges Spitz, published in 1886 by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de G\u00e9ographie (fig. 66.4), but perhaps dating a bit earlier. Unlike the model in the photograph, who is nude from the waist up, Gauguin\u2019s figure is covered by a flowered fabric from the neck down. Moreover, as Heilbrun pointed out, Gauguin slightly modified the pose of Spitz\u2019s model: in the gouache, the young woman crosses her hands behind her head more assuredly (and slightly provocatively), which lifts her chest accordingly.\n\nIt is difficult to establish a sequence of creation here, but it should be noted that Tahitian Girl in a Pink Pareu (cat. 67) is a cognate of the entire matrix, including the head of a Tahitian man in a lower corner. The Toronto impression retains the firm contour line of the matrix, whereas the present sheet captures more of its color. The dry quality of all three impressions is due to their having been transferred from a work on paper rather than from a metal or glass plate.\n\nStarr Figura suggested that the inclusion of the male profile at the lower edge of the matrix could represent an artist contemplating his model and went on to observe that the relationship between the two is more ambiguous in the other Chicago counterproof on this subject, where the figures appear \u201cmore diffuse and illegible.\u201d  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold at Sotheby's Parke-Bernet and Company, New York, to Alice Adam Ltd., Chicago, for Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, May 6, 1980.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 199 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Chicago only).\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.
