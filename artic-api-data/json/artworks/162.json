    "description": "<p>This large handled jar held the water used to dilute large quantities of wine in preparation for the Greek symposium. It was considered uncivilized for a Greek to consume undiluted wine, so water was fetched from a public fountain house in a jar like this one. The horizontal handles made it easier to carry, while the vertical handle at the back was used for pouring.</p>\n<p>On the front of this vase, the hero Hercules wrestles Triton -  the messenger of the sea who is depicted as a merman - as a man and a woman look on. They are likely Nereus and Triton's mother Amphitrite, but we cannot be certain.  The intricate composition has the Greek hero astride the monster, his arms locked around Triton's neck in an implacable grip, while Triton flails his arms, black fingers stretched against the red background. They face different directions-Herakles to the viewers' right and up, victorious, and Triton to the left and down, vanquished. Precise incision renders the outline and details of the lion skin that Herakles wears, as well as the contour and detail of Triton's scales and fins. Above this scenethe artist has written kalo[s]p[u]this \u2013 or &quot;Pythis [is] beautiful&quot;; exactly who Pythis is is another mystery.</p>\n<p>On the shoulder of the vessel, the area above the front scene on the flat surface between the handles, another mythological scene plays out. This time it is the judgement of Paris, in which the handsome youth must judge a beauty contest between three goddesses - Aphrodite, Hera and Athena (shown seated). Aphrodite famously wins the contest by promising Paris the love of the most beautiful woman in the world. The woman in question turns out to be Helen of Troy, whose love affair with Paris would set in motion the deadly Trojan war.</p>\n",
