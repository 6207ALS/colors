He experimented with many different styles, from Impressionism to Symbolism, and was adaptable even when working on a single image. This composition must have evolved as he drew. It comprises three individual pieces of paper.</p>\n<p>Traversing a watery expanse, personifications of the arts (music, painting, poetry or literature, and sculpture) come to alleviate laborers from drudgery. The muse of architecture sits unshackled at the foot of the image.</p>\n",
