    "description": "<p>This program will take place in the Alsdorf galleries, particularly in Gallery 141.</p><p>In this performance, Seth Parker Woods juxtaposes a series of solo cello works\u2014from 17th-century Italian Baroque pieces to 20th- and 21st-century radical contemporary compositions. Drawing inspiration from natural landscapes, found sounds, the Twi language, and Tibetan ritualistic practices to create their compositions, the various works on this program together offer insight into the connections and conversations between the old and new around the theme of invention and the act of borrowing.</p><p><strong>Program<br><em>Dehiscence: A Sonic Radicalisation</em></strong></p><p>Anonymous<br><em>Sonata in A minor: Como Manuscript</em></p><p>Giacinto Scelsi<br><em>Maknongan</em> (1976) <br>Solo cello</p><p>Giuseppe Maria Dall' Abaco<br><em>Capriccio primo</em> <br>Solo cello</p><p>Claudio Gabriele<br><em>PNOM</em> (2005) <br>Solo cello</p><p>Giovanni Battista Vitali<br><em>Passa Galli</em> <br>Solo cello</p><p>Alvin Singleton<br><em>Argoru II</em> (1970) <br>Solo cello</p><p>Giacinto Scelsi<br><em>Triphon: Jeunesse, Energie</em> (1957) <br>Solo cello</p><p>Artists Connect is a series of in-gallery programs that highlight the creative process.
