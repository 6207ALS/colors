    "description": "<p>From an early age, Albrecht D\u00fcrer displayed an inquisitive mind and exceptional talent as a draftsman. He was born in Nuremberg and first trained as a goldsmith  in his father\u2019s shop before apprenticing with the painter Michael Wolgemut. One  of his earliest animal drawings, <em>Young Steer</em> shows its subject grazing in an unseen field. The artist\u2019s sure strokes and adept cross-hatching delineate the steer\u2019s sculptural form, with taut skin stretched over a strong yet bony frame. D\u00fcrer\u2019s precise draftsmanship recalls the drawings and prints of the celebrated German master Martin Schongauer, whom he greatly admired. This work was probably a study from nature; sketchy lines around the animal\u2019s right hind foot, back, muzzle, and horns reveal that the artist originally drew the steer in a slightly different position, with his mouth open. A masterful engraver who would elevate printmaking to an expressive art form over the course of his career, D\u00fcrer employed the steer\u2019s hindquarters for the barnyard scene in his engraving <em>The Prodigal Son amid the Swine</em> (1494/96), an impression of which is in the Art Institute.</p>\n",
