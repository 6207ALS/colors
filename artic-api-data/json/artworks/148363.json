He stands regally in this sculpture from the Gupta period, wearing a simple crown and a long garland. Originally four-armed, he would have held weapons\u2014a mace, conch, and discus\u2014in three hands. This early image includes a round object, variously interpreted as the earth or a fruit, in his lowered fourth hand. In later images of Vishnu, this hand typically holds a lotus.</p>\n",
