    "description": "<p>Chicago architect Stanley Tigerman has long engaged with the domestic form, from postmodern houses based on concepts of rupture, humor, and allusion to work on multifamily and low-income housing. His designs for houses in the 1970s employed simple modern structures coupled with playful, representational elements, like rippling false front of the House with a Pompadour, that refers to the client\u2019s distinctive hairstyle. Tigerman\u2019s work in the 1980s and 1990s became more complex and socially invested, as seen in works like the Copley Residence or \u201cButterfly House,\u201d whose split form was designed to create public and private spaces; or the Momochi Housing Project in Japan, which embraces the grid\u2019s connection to traditional Japanese architecture, scaffolding, and other nonhierarchical forms.</p>\n",
