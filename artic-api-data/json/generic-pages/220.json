Built jointly with the city of Chicago for the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and Adams Street, that building\u2014its entry flanked by the two famous bronze lions\u2014remains the \u201cfront door\u201d of the museum even today. In keeping with the academic origins of the institution, a research library was constructed in 1901; eight major expansions for gallery and administrative space have followed, with the latest being the Modern Wing, which opened in 2009. The permanent collection has grown from plaster casts to nearly 300,000 works of art in fields ranging from Chinese bronzes to contemporary design and from textiles to installation art. Together, the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the museum of the Art Institute of Chicago are now internationally recognized as two of the leading fine-arts institutions in the United States.
