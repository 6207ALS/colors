The self-portrait\u2014one of just two the artist created\u2014alludes to her itinerant lifestyle and her journey to becoming a painter. Originally a Surrealist poet based in Paris, Rahon left France in 1939 for Mexico City, where she took up painting as well as sculpture. Her fascination with the cultures and landscapes of Mexico led her to develop a style inspired by Paleolithic cave art. This work's shimmering surface is composed of materials sourced from nature, including sand and volcanic ash, further grounding it in the place where it was created.</p>\n",
