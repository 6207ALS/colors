    "description": "<p>From 1963 to 1968 Warhol produced hundreds of 16mm films. Drawing from a wide range of genres and styles, he consistently worked to redefine both the viewing experience and the practice of filmmaking itself. In his most experimental projects, he pushed the audience\u2019s limits with lengthy films, constructed new definitions of cinematic performance, and embraced the flaws inherent to the material characteristics of film itself, accepting the occurrence of accident, chance, and imperfection.&nbsp;</p><p>Presented on the occasion of the exhibition&nbsp;<a href=\"/exhibitions/2937/andy-warhol-from-a-to-b-and-back-again\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Andy Warhol\u2014From A to B and Back Again</em></a>, this series explores some of the singular film works of Andy Warhol.&nbsp;<br></p><p><u>Program</u><em><br>Beauty #2</em> (1965, 16mm, black and white, sound, 66 minutes)<em><br>Lonesome Cowboys</em> (1968, 16mm, color, sound, 109 minutes)</p><p>If this program reaches capacity, a standby line will form outside the venue 30 minutes before the event begins.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
