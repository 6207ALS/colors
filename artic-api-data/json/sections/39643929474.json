One of these was transfer drawing, of which this work is an example. Depicted on the left portion of the sheet is a seated woman, her legs crossed as she looks down toward her hands. Her upper torso is bare, but wrapped around her waist is a traditional Tahitian pareu, its floral pattern vaguely visible on the portion covering her proper left leg. On the upper right side of the sheet is a pair of seated women. The process of creating a transfer drawing (most likely in a studio) prompted Gauguin to select sketches and graphite drawings, often made in the presence of his subject, as referents for the transferred image. The artist traced this transfer drawing directly from Seated Tahitian Woman (fig. 125.2 [cat. 48]), a double-sided sheet from his first stay in Tahiti. The seated figure can be found in No te aha oe riri (Why Are You Angry?) from 1896 (cat. 90). It also reappears in the 1902 painting Sister of Charity (fig. 125.3 [W 617]).\n\nThe two seated females at the right most likely derive from different ancillary drawings, since the motif appears separately in work after Gauguin\u2019s return to Tahiti, such as the 1896 painting Eiaha ohipa (Do Not Work) (fig. 125.4 [W 538]) and the 1901 Et l\u2019or de leur corps (The Gold of Their Bodies) (fig. 125.5 [W 596]). Both paintings present a similar configuration of two seated women, although they are the reverse of their counterparts in the Art Institute\u2019s work. This indicates that the drawing or sketch Gauguin traced to make this transfer drawing depicted the figural group in the same orientation as in the two paintings. Their placement may have had more to do with the methods of tracing than with any specific compositional meaning.\n\nGauguin also used works of art by others as source material. On both of his trips to Tahiti, he took with him a trunk filled with reproductions of works of art. The present drawing is a synthesis of personal observation and source material. The seated figure on the left side of the sheet is comparable to the central seated figure in Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s famous painting The Woman of Algiers in Their Apartment of 1834 (fig. 125.6), which Gauguin would have seen in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, and his 1849 reprise of this composition (fig. 125.7). The depiction of a central figure sitting cross-legged is a common compositional element in Delacroix\u2019s drawings and paintings, and it appears often in sketches as well (fig. 125.8).\n\nFor his drawings, prints, and paintings, Gauguin\u2019s working method involved continuously repeating, shifting, and recombining motifs. His innovations in mediums aided in his appropriation of visual source material, through the act of tracing or reusing for major and minor works alike. A comparable technique is also discernible in his writing, where he commonly incorporated passages from other people\u2019s texts, often weaving them seamlessly into his fragmentary narratives. Although commonly dismissed as plagiarism (regarding Gauguin\u2019s visual art, Camille Pissarro accused his former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of \u201ccopping\u201d his subjects from other cultures). Linda Goddard likened this mode of writing to making a \u201ccollage\u201d akin to the manipulation, adaptation, and incorporation of source materials that were essential to Gauguin\u2019s creative process.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold to Victor Segalen (1878\u20131919) at the public auction of the artist\u2019s belongings upon his death, Papeete, Tahiti, Sept. 2, 1903.\n\nAmbroise Vollard (1866\u20131939), Paris.\n\nGalerie Marcel Guiot (1893\u20131977), Paris, by 1942.\n\nL\u00e9on Villiers until 1963.\n\nPrivate collection, Paris.\n\nSold to Alice Adam Ltd., Chicago, for Edward McCormick Blair, Chicago, (1915\u20132010), May 1984.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Marcel Guiot, Exposition Gauguin: Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, May 15\u2013June 13, 1942, cat. 39 (ill.).\n\nWashington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 264 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, as Gauguin, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Paris only).\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.

Field, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, exh. cat. (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), p. 19. For more information, see the introduction on transfer drawings by Erika Mosier, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Technical Experiments in Woodcut and Oil Transfer Drawing,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), pp. 60\u201371. Mosier explained that, for a traditional monotype, ink or another wet pigment is drawn onto a piece of glass or metal, covered with a sheet of paper, and then printed by hand or run through a press to create a unique impression. Gauguin, however, rolled oil-based printing ink on a sheet of paper and laid a second, uninked sheet over it. He then traced an image from a previous drawing onto the uninked sheet, transferring ink from below, thus creating this type of transfer of a drawing.\n\nOn Gauguin\u2019s unique printmaking techniques, see Starr Figura, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Metamorphoses: Repetition, Transformation, and the Catalyst of Printmaking,\u201d in Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), pp. 14\u201335.\n\nIn addition to Sister of Charity, the motif appears in another pen-and-brown-ink drawing on vellum (D\u00e9partement des Arts Graphiques, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, RF 29331, recto) (see Exposition Gauguin: Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, preface by Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, exh. cat. [Galerie Marcel Guiot, 1942], pp. 24, 228, no. 38 [ill.]); and in a second transfer drawing included in the artist\u2019s 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and after), p. 179. A transfer drawing creates a mirrored image of an original drawing: the image is achieved by lifting ink off of a matrix onto the back of a sheet of paper by tracing or drawing onto the front of that sheet. In the version in Avant et apr\u00e8s, a woman sits in the same position as in the original 1891/93 pen-and-ink drawing (cat. 48). Her face is angled down, as if she is looking to the right-hand side of the sheet, the reverse of the image seen here. This suggests that the version in Avant et apr\u00e8s is itself a transfer drawing produced from the Art Institute\u2019s transfer drawing rather than an earlier pen-and-ink sketch. The affinity of the two transfer drawings and the graphite tracing lines on the drawing (cat. 48) led Richard Brettell to date all this activity to 1902 in Atuona. See Brettell in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F. Stuckey, The Art of Paul Gauguin, with assistance from Peter Zegers, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books), p. 472.\n\nDouglas Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat.

One, made on a trip to Algeria, contains studies for Woman of Algiers. The Mus\u00e9e du Louvre acquired this sketchbook in 1891, but it is not known whether Gauguin saw it.\n\nFor a discussion of Gauguin\u2019s use in his writings of various source material from literary works, see Linda Goddard, \u201cAuthorship and Originality in Paul Gauguin\u2019s Diverses Choses,\u201d Art History 34, no. 2 (Apr. 2011), pp. 352\u201369; and Goddard, \u201cFollowing the Moon: Gauguin\u2019s Writing and the Myth of the \u2018Primitive,\u2019\u201d in Gauguin: Maker of Myth, ed.

This drawing was part of Gauguin\u2019s portfolio, Documents Tahiti 1891, 1892, 1893, which remained together until it was dispersed at the 1942 Galerie Marcel Guiot sale. Due to the contents of the portfolio, which contained many of Gauguin\u2019s later monotypes from 1899 or 1900, Field assumes this was part of the artist\u2019s estate at the time of his death.
