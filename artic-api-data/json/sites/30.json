    "description": "Poet Wallace Stevens may have had \u201cThirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird,\u201d but this season the Art Institute of Chicago, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago, and Poetry Foundation come together to present 500 Ways of Looking at Modern, a yearlong exploration of what modern means. Join us every week for a series of exhibitions, performances, readings, family programs, talks, tours, and lectures as we look at \u201cmodern\u201d from the perspective of artists, curators, dancers, museum directors, musicians, poets, and scholars. Each week offers a fresh way of looking. Many events are free of charge and occur on Thursdays at 6:00 in Fullerton Hall at the Art Institute of Chicago, except where noted.",
