The same year, he renewed contact with Serge Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes, which was staging a new version of Le chant du rossignol (The Song of the Nightingale) with sets and costumes that the artist had designed for the original 1920 production. Over the course of the year, Matisse\u2019s experience with the company was documented in such paintings as The Ballet Dancer, Harmony in Grey (1927; fig. 40-41.1), Ballet Dancer Seated on a Stool (1927; fig. 40-41.2), and a series of lithographs, Ten Dancers, published by the Galerie d\u2019Art Contemporain in Paris (see fig. 40-41.3 and fig. 40-41.4).\n\nThe model for both Dancer Resting and Seated Dancer was likely Henriette Darricarr\u00e8re, who sat regularly for Matisse from 1920, when he first noticed her working as a film extra in Nice, until 1927. A photograph of Darricarr\u00e8re as a dancer on the balcony of Matisse\u2019s apartment at 1, place Charles-F\u00e9lix, in Nice (fig. 40-41.5) demonstrates her theatrical spirit and echoes Matisse\u2019s description of the experience of sketching her. He wrote: \u201cthe foam of this tutu and the way the legs spurt out of it . . . at moments like these . . . I reach blindly for pen and paper, and I truly don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing. My line is unbroken and, as it travels from the tranquil to the piquant, it recreates along the way how I feel.\u201d In presenting costumed ballerinas at rest, Matisse drew upon his model\u2019s stage-like presence to guide his hand in fluid, determined strokes.\n\nThe composition of the pen-and-ink line drawing Dancer Resting resembles that of Matisse\u2019s lithograph Sleeping Dancer on a Couch (fig. 40-41.4) from the Ten Dancers portfolio, but it has a great economy of line and replaces the shading in the lithograph with expanses of untouched, white paper. In Dancer Resting, the figure stretches out horizontally across the page in a curious pose, her body supported by cushions that, with only a few strokes of the brush, suggest a bed or sofa. The long, flowing lines of the dancer\u2019s arms and legs extend off the edge of the narrow page, drawing focus to the staccato brushwork of the decorative embroidery on the bodice and the tiered flounces of the skirt that enliven the composition.\n\nIn the graphite sketch Seated Dancer, Matisse combined the effects of blank spaces and careful shading to present the figure as set back from the viewer. Lightly sketched props establish the scene and accent the angled lean of the dancer\u2019s seated pose. Matisse used heavier pencil strokes to outline the edge of the model\u2019s body and the ruffled bottom of the tutu. The naturalistic details, the soft shading and careful outlines of the heavy necklace, decorated bust of the dress, and bow, heighten the presence of the solitary dancer.  \nBrandon Ruud, Marin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr, and Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\n1958, Probably June: Dancer Resting (Knoedler Gallery, Exhibition of Old Master, Impressionist, and Contemporary Drawings, exh. cat.
