    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Look at this painting for a while. You can just feel yourself slow down. It's done in a style that art historians now call &quot;Luminism,&quot; for its glowing light and clear definition of form. Martin Johnson Heade wanted to convey a sense of stillness and transcendence in his landscapes, and to encourage contemplation.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: For Heade, he's interested in.. these effects of light in atmosphere.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Ellen Roberts, from the Art Institute's Department of American Art.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: Heade is an interesting character, because he painted the same motifs over and over and over again. He painted grain stacks, he painted the marshes especially, on the New England coast, over and over again. The compositions were extremely horizontal compared to a typical landscape of the time. Quite horizontal, which I think kind of accentuates the quiet that you see here. The New England seashore was becoming more and more populated at the time, there were more and more hints of industrialization. And as a result it's almost an idealized view here, where you still see the commerce, human commerce, in this case fishing, in harmony with the beautiful landscape, and not at war with it.</p>\n",
