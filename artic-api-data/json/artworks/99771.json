    "description": "<p>Cornell\u2019s interest in the cubist artist <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34747\">Juan Gris</a> prompted a series of boxes and several collages, as well as a dossier containing notes, cutout reproductions, and catalogues. At least fifteen boxes and several collages related to Gris have been identified by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan (see Anne d\u2019Harnoncourt, \u201cThe Cubist Cockatoo: A Preliminary Exploration of Joseph Cornell\u2018s Homages to Juan Gris,\u201d <em>Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin</em> 74 [June 1978, p. 6). The imagery of this series of boxes is tied both to Cornell\u2019s bird boxes and to his Hotel Boxes. In boxes such as this one, Cornell showed an unusual and subtle response to Gris\u2019s unique type of Cubist collage. This is particularly apparent when, as in this case, the white cockatoo that is so often the central feature in the Gris series is absent and only the outline remains, echoed by a black paper shadow more geometric in character than the outline itself. The play between representation and reality so central to Cubism is alluded to not just in the outline and shadow, and in the central cluster of forms of varying degree of abstraction, but also in the real wooden branch extending from the rear wall of the box-cage.</p>\n<p>Here Cornell used a French newspaper text to cover the inside walls of the box, integrating it into the box\u2019s surface by painting and pasting over it in a manner similar to Gris\u2018s. More generally, however, Gris\u2019s persistent love of the particular shapes of his objects and his unexpected tenderness for the picturesque and romantic (see, for example, his 1914 Flowers, collection Hester Diamond, or his 1913 Guitar, Paris, Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019art moderne, with its fragment of a sentimental nineteenth century print; ill. in London, Whitechapel Art Gallery, Juan Gris, 1992, exh. cat., nos. 44, 28, respectively) find an echo in Cornell. As Anne d\u2019Harnoncourt noted, \u201cThe bits of newsprint, flowered and marbleized papers, or empty tobacco packets in Gris\u2019s collages of 1913\u201314 have a keepsake quality quite unlike similar fragments incorporated into works by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36198\">Picasso</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33739\">Braque\u201d</a> (d\u2019Harnoncourt 1978, p. 9). Moreover, Gris incorporated a fragment of mirror into his Washstand of 1912 (private collection; Douglas Cooper, Juan Gris, vol. 1, Paris, 1977, no. 26, ill.).</p>\n<p>This is not to argue an \u201cinfluence\u201d of a simple or direct kind. Cornell\u2019s work is built on a series of responses and experiences of a peculiarly private nature. There is no obvious reason, for example, for Cornell\u2018s choice of a cockatoo as the emblem of his Gris Boxes. Music, so important to Cornell, may have provided the thread of connections here. It seems that he associated Gris with the nineteenth-century contralto Malibran, who like Gris died at a tragically young age, and was described as \u201cthe bird of song\u201d by Hans Christian Andersen, whom Cornell also admired (Ashton 1974, p. 24, citing Monica Stirling, <em>The Life and Times of Hans Christian Andersen</em>, New York, 1965).</p>\n<p>Although Cornell could well have been familiar with Gris\u2019s work earlier (Curt Valentin\u2019s Buchholz Gallery, New York, held an exhibition in 1950), it was the sight of <em>Figure Seated in a Cafe</em> (1914, Mr. and Mrs. Leigh B. Block; Cooper 1977,) in 1953 at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, that first seized his imagination. He wrote in retrospect, in 1961: \u201cThe so-called \u2018Juan Gris\u2019 boxes were not worked out slavishly \u2014mechanically\u2014from this collected material the original inspiration was purely a human reaction to a particular painting at the Janis Gallery\u2014a man reading a newspaper at a cafe table covered almost completely by his reading material\u201d (Cornell 1993, p. 285). Cornell\u2019s interest in Gris, which lasted through the mid-1960s, experienced a renewal in the late 1950s with the large Gris retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1958, and the publication of John Golding\u2019s <em>Cubism: A History and an Analysis</em> in 1959, to which he referred on several occasions in his diaries. Cornell\u2018s practice of working on a piece over a period of several years, or of leaving it fallow for a while, seems to be true of <em>For Juan Gris #7</em>. He wrote in a diary entry of January 1960 (Cornell 1993, p. 273): \u201c1/24/60 Sunday Gris #7 / \u2018creative\u2019 reviewing / Gris #7 taken from storage in semi-unresolved difficult time\u2014and then\u2014miracle of unfoldment / appreciation / \u2018treasure\u2019\u201d Whether Cornell implied here, through the use of one of his favorite words, \u201cunfoldment,\u201d that he resolved the work, or simply reviewed it and found it complete, remains uncertain.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 76-77.</p>\n",
