Robinson, 1947.883\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Opaque white glass with some pinprick bubbles. Cast and rotary polished, short outsplayed rim, the edge rounded by grinding, bends down and inward to form a short, convex-profile collar above a deep convex body on a short, flared base ring. The foot has a flat depression on its underside, the edge rounded by reheating and somewhat uneven. For a zoomable image, see fig. 82.1.\n\nThe piece is intact with light-brown weathering product overall with some pitting, irregular horizontal areas appear scraped and cleaned; weathering product is worn away. Rough parallel grinding marks from cleaning are on the interior. A small strain crack is at the carination above the body on the interior.\n\nThis shape was extremely popular and was made in a variety of sizes and profiles; for additional remarks see the Art Institute\u2019s translucent deep-blue glass example (cat. 81) and the example in the mosaic glass technique (cat. 83).  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 82 Bowl or Cup, mid-1st century A.D.\n\nfig. 82.1 Bowl or Cup (mid-1st century A.D.).
