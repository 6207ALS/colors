    "copy": " In Twilight , Hale Woodruff applied bold and thick streaks of pigment to expressively show the changing light of the evening sky. Woodruff was inspired by other painters who experimented with form, color, and abstraction including Paul Cezanne and fellow African American painter Henry Ossawa Tanner, who became a mentor and friend. In the early 20th century, racial discrimination limited opportunities for African American artists to receive training, exhibit their work, and find paid work in their field. Woodruff pushed through these obstacles to have a rich and influential career as an artist and educator. ",
