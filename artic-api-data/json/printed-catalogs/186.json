    "copy": " This groundbreaking study focuses on John Singer Sargent\u2019s sustained, yet largely overlooked, involvement with Chicago\u2019s vibrant Gilded Age culture. Documenting the artist\u2019s personal connections to the city and the prominence of his work in Chicago collections, Annelise K. Madsen explores Sargent\u2019s various contributions to Chicago\u2019s artistic life, including his long-standing participation in local exhibitions. With scholarly rigor, this volume also delves into the taste and scope of midwestern patronage at the turn of the century, offering valuable insights into Chicago\u2019s civic and cultural ambitions. Richly illustrated, John Singer Sargent and Chicago\u2019s Gilded Age is an original and engaging examination of the complex relationship between one of the most cosmopolitan artists of his generation and the city of Chicago.
