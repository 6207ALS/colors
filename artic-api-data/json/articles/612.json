    "title": "Behind the Scenes with Conservation Science",
    "copy": " The narrative of conservation is well known\u2014a piece is obscured or damaged or aged, and conservators work to get it back to its original state (or as close as it can get to its original state). It\u2019s part of the magic of museums\u2014making the impossible possible. But there\u2019s a first step to the process. You can\u2019t dive into a piece of art and start working its elements to get it back into shape; you have to study it and research it, spend time with it and get to know it. Even before that, you have to understand how to research it\u2014what kind of materials it is made of, how old it is, what the demands are, and just how far you can safely push the piece.   This is where conservation science comes in. Conservation science has close ties to fields such as forensics and even detective work, but it combines these scientific elements and methods and applies them to art. And the goal of a project doesn\u2019t always involve conservation. For Moholy-Nagy: Future Present , the team researched Moholy\u2019s plastics to reveal the artist\u2019s pioneering use of new industrial materials and to ensure they would be safe for travel; for Van Gogh\u2019s Bedrooms , conservation scientists uncovered the potential original colors of the Bedroom paintings, which had changed over the years. The how of art is one of the most exciting aspects of conservation science. Francesca Casadio, the Art Institute\u2019s Andrew W Mellon Senior Conservation Scientist, says, \u201cWith us, [we say], \u2018Here\u2019s a thing, and we\u2019ll show you how it\u2019s made.\u2019\u201d For the public, part of what makes conservation science so fascinating is that it\u2019s more about curiosity than interpretation. \u201cSome stories about how this was made or how this has changed have that element of discovery, and you can create new engagement and can bring visitors to a more level playing field where they don\u2019t need to know anything\u2014they just need to be curious. When you\u2019re getting to the level of the making, there\u2019s no hierarchy of, \u2018Oh, I should come into the art museum, and I should know what to look for and what is important and what is great or not great.\u2019\u201d Conservation science is a peculiar field because few, if any, of the pieces of equipment are made for conservation science. \u201cThey come from forensics, R&D. Those portable X-ray fluorescence analyzers\u2014they\u2019re now used extensively in geology and quality control. That technology didn\u2019t exist 15 years ago. It was actually developed to go on the Mars Rover.\u201d X-ray fluorescence analyzers\u2014or XRFs\u2014give a snapshot of the composition of a work to determine what it\u2019s made of. It\u2019s easy to see how this could come in handy on Mars, and for art it serves a similar purpose. The elemental makeup of an object can determine much about its history.   Francesca leads me through the various conservation labs\u2014part artists\u2019 studio, part chemistry lab, and part hospital\u2014showing me a large rack of pigments lining a wall near the painting lab. Every color imaginable is catalogued in slight glass vials, labeled in tight handwriting that\u2019s faded with age. \u201cThese are our fingerprints,\u201d Francesca tells me. It\u2019s a database that makes it easier to match original pigments in paintings or to determine how they were made. Put together the information from the XRF with the pigment database, and you\u2019ve uncovered far more than elemental data, but a historical context. Two virtually identical green pigments could vary wildly in composition based on their place of origin.   Interestingly, it\u2019s not just older paintings and the like that get sent to conservation. One of the trickiest genres is contemporary art. \u201cCertainly, for conservation and preservation, contemporary art is very challenging\u201d Francesca says. \u201cThere are many more discussions, and everything is more open-ended than with Old Masters. You\u2019d never think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s chipped around the edges, let\u2019s consider whether we\u2019ll make a new one.\u2019 You would never do that with Old Masters. But with contemporary art, sometimes it happens. Refabrications and things of the like. It\u2019s also about the artist\u2019s intention and whether preserving the original materials is really essential to preserve the artist\u2019s original intent. It\u2019s much more complicated.\u201d When it boils down to intention, there\u2019s a more philosophical bent to the conversations surrounding conservation. \u201cIf the artist wanted to build a site-specific installation with pig\u2019s blood and now the building is to be demolished, what do you do? Do you take it out? Now the pig\u2019s blood is rotten and it\u2019s making everything corrode. Do you rebuild it to look new? Is the artwork finished because the site no longer exists?\u201d \u201cThere are philosophical issues with conserving and treating Old Masters too,\u201d she adds, \u201cbecause if there\u2019s a big loss, we always have discussions: \u2018What do we do? Do we compensate?\u2019 They\u2019re less dramatic in terms of options. The options are less vast than when you deal with contemporary art.\u201d There\u2019s a further personal, halfway philosophical issue that comes up when actually handling the artwork. I ask Francesca if she ever gets nervous, handling artworks so closely. \u201cMore than the nerve-rackingness,\u201d she says, \u201cit\u2019s really a magic experience to be so close in the conservation studio or in the lab. It\u2019s this kind of intimacy that you have with the object that I think is really special.\u201d Ultimately, for Francesca, \u201cart objects are not static objects. I like the idea that the museum is a place where we make discoveries, where the art is really alive and it\u2019s just waiting to give more.\u201d \u2014Katie Antonsson ",
