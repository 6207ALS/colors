Gauguin  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Walter S. Brewster, 1949.605  \nKornfeld 73  \nFor a verso, see fig. 116.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">In this work, Gauguin combined several different working methods to create a blend of imagery that expressed his political position during the latter stages of his career. First, he made a transfer drawing taking forms from various drawings and transferring them directly to this sheet. Known as a paper-to-paper transfer, an intermediary sheet of inked paper was used to facilitate the transfer. The artist clearly reserved the top third of the sheet by folding it back so that he could focus on the bottom two thirds, to which he added watercolor, pen, and black ink to clarify and intensify transferred lines, and black colored pencil that was used for his signature and to emphasize several details in the lower left.\n\nUpon completion of the hand-colored transfer drawing, he unfolded the sheet and proceeded to print one of his headpieces for Le sourire (The Smile), to which he added an ultramarine-blue (est.) watercolor wash. According to numerous sources, the choice of this particular headpiece was not random, but rather a scathing depiction of the same figure pictured in the drawing below\u2014Governer Gallet\u2014as a crouching, ape-like form. Gauguin pasted another impression of the print, with pen and brown ink embellishment, on the cloth cover of the complete edition of Le sourire, which he sent to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid in 1902 (fig. 116.2).\n\nGauguin carved interchangeable vignettes and headpieces to accompany the text of his self-published journal, Le sourire. Here he used a small piece of coarsely grained wood, in contrast to the fine-grained boxwood used for Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) and Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). As in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105), this piece of wood likely derived from an indigenous source that the artist prepared for carving and printing himself.\n\nGauguin reinforced his hand-colored transfer drawing with additions in pen and black ink and an array of watercolors. Also, it was only after he printed the block in black ink for this headpiece that he added blue behind it. The black ink contained a significant amount of binder. This is represented by faint halos around the printed lines and the reticulated pattern of ink deposition. These characteristics are indicative of an oil binder such as linseed oil added to the ink to obtain the desired viscosity and working properties.\n\nThe paper is a poor quality, machine-made wove paper. It is irregularly trimmed along all four sides. Gauguin favored this paper, as well as a thin, ivory Japanese paper, for his printing of the various headpieces. Given his lack of good quality paper, this selection was probably one of necessity rather than a deliberate aesthetic choice on his part.\n\n298 \u00d7 204 mm (sheet); 98 \u00d7 164 mm (headpiece)\n\nWhen the work entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection in 1949, it was already in extremely poor condition and had been mounted to a brittle, acidic board to provide structural stability. The paper was very discolored, and the unintended golden-yellow tone obscured the vibrancy of the watercolor that had already selectively faded to some degree throughout.\n\nThe artwork underwent an extensive conservation intervention in anticipation of its inclusion in the 2009 exhibition Gauguin: Maker of Myth (see Exhibition History). Treatment involved removal of the sheet from the mount, reduction of discoloration and staining, filling of substantial areas of loss, and image compensation to unify the composition (fig. 116.3).\n\nThe work is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
