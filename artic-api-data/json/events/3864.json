    "description": "<p><em>A missing can of film</em></p><p>In December of that war year, a communist filmmaker disappeared. A rumor circulated: he had made a covert film, embarrassing to our own side. He had left behind a 16 mm film, hidden inside a can of cooking flour. It may not have been the enemy army that killed him. </p><p>Most of Mohaiemen\u2019s work over the last two decades has been a search for mirages such as a missing film canister. The revealed futility of these quests, and the stories to take away the bitter, are the subjects of this lecture.</p><p><strong>About the artist</strong><br>Naeem Mohaiemen combines films, installations, and essays to research vanquished left utopias and incomplete decolonizations\u2014framed by Third World Internationalism and World Socialism. In spite of underscoring a left tendency toward misrecognition of allies, a hope for an as-yet unborn international left, as the only future alternative to current polarities of race and religion, is a basis for the work. Family history as a canvas for thinking through how borders (arbitrary, sinister) and passports (precious, missing) commingle with, and against, class privilege, is a throughline in the work. The film archive within his projects\u2014fabricated, and reanimated\u2014is the site of promise and disappointment. Projects were shown at documenta 14, Athens/Kassel; Ashkal Alwan, Beirut; Kiran Nadar, Delhi; Museo Universitario Arte Contempor\u00e1neo, Mexico City; Museum of Modern Art, New York; and the Sharjah, Venice, and Lahore Biennials. Mohaiemen co-edited <em >System Error: War is a Force That Gives Us Meaning</em> (Silvana Editoriale, 2007).</p><p>This event will be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LalEVmEGINI\">streamed live</a>.</p><p>This lecture is the keynote address for the symposium <a href=\"/event/symposium-unfixed-material-challenges-contemporary-art\">UNFIXED: Material Challenges in Contemporary Art</a>.</p>",
