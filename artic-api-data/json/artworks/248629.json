    "description": "<p>This work\u2019s central circular form consists of collaged strips from a playbill for a performance of <em>The Bald Soprano</em> (1950), an absurdist play by Romanian-French playwright Eugene Ionesco marked by disorienting non-sequiturs and circuitous dialogue. As a student at Black Mountain College in North Carolina from 1945 to 1948, Ray Johnson took part in similarly unconventional performances. By the mid-1950s, when he made this work, Johnson was living in New York and collaborating with artists working in experimental dance and theater. <em>Untitled (Soprano)</em>\u2019s radiating collaged forms evoke such interdisciplinary influences, giving it a sense of dynamism that exists somewhere between the stillness of painting and the movement and fleeting quality of performance.</p>\n",
