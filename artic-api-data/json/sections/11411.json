StrotherA Nude Figure, c. 1878  \nBlack and white chalks and pink pastel, on brown wove paper; 28.7 \u00d7 18.6 cm (11 5/16 \u00d7 7 5/16 in.)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, the Charles Deering Collection, 1927.5884\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">One of James McNeill Whistler\u2019s friends recalled in 1908 that the artist liked to have female models with him when he was in his studio, \u201cfor, as he watched their movements, they would take the pose he wanted, or suggest a group, an arrangement,\u201d which he would then capture. It is easy to see how this drawing of a nude model might have emerged from such a practice, since the figure\u2019s loose contrapposto pose appears natural and unaffected. Her right hip slung outward, she turns her shoulders and head toward her right side, enlivening the page with a sense of gentle movement. This easy stance is quite unlike the contrived positioning of Whistler\u2019s subjects in many of his formal portraits.\n\nWhistler outlined in sweeping strokes of black charcoal the graceful curves of the woman\u2019s body and the flow of the drapery that cascades to the floor behind her. He reworked portions of the figure\u2019s left arm and shoulder. Especially in the area of the extended elbow, the foreshortening of the forms would have presented a challenge. He created further definition within the black outlines through the addition of white highlights and surrounded the figure in a soft pink\u2013orange aura. The combination of the pink-orange chalk and the highly textured brown paper brings warmth to the image and activates the empty space around the model. Whistler used black and white chalk on similar paper for an earlier figure drawing in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (Draped Model, cat. 10), but the addition of the colored chalk adds visual complexity to this study.\n\nThe creative impulse underlying much of Whistler\u2019s work\u2013\u2013this drawing included\u2013\u2013was propelled by a desire to suggest, rather than to describe in detail. The artist employed a minimum of line to portray the figure and did not render features completely; multiple areas of the drawing\u2013\u2013including the model\u2019s facial profile, left hand, and feet, as well as the bottom of the drapery\u2014were left undefined. This produces a fluid boundary between human form, drapery, and paper support that merges all three into a single plane. Color was added here not for the purpose of making the formal relationships less abstract but rather to heighten the image\u2019s aesthetic appeal.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">A Nude Figure corresponds to Margaret F.
