    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  In the late 15th century, Hans Memling was the leading painter in the wealthy city of Bruges in the southern Netherlands.  He specialized in altarpieces and in exquisitely painted small devotional images used during private prayer, such as this one.  Curator Martha Wolff:<br>Martha Wolff:  It shows the Virgin and Child at half-length as though they were appearing in a window opening.  The Virgin is handing him an apple, and the apple is probably a reference to the fall of man, to Adam and Eve, the eating of the apple and then the redemption of man through the coming of Christ.<br />\nNarrator:  The back of the adjacent panel is shown here too.  It depicts St. Anthony of Padua carrying the Christ Child.  These two panels were originally hinged together, forming a diptych.  St. Anthony was the patron saint of the donor, the person who commissioned the diptych.  His portrait, now in poor condition, is on the other side.  When the diptych was open, the praying donor would have faced the Virgin and Child.<br />\nMartha Wolff:  In the convex mirror behind the Virgin, you see a reflection of the window opening, and you also see two tiny figures, two little girls, as they appear to be, and these figures, these little girls, are not visible in the picture itself.  So it's unclear what they might be, but they are perhaps images of deceased children of the donor.&quot;</p>\n",
