    "description": "<p>At the beginning of 2020, just as global COVID-19 restrictions were coming into force, David Hockney was at his new house, studio and garden in Normandy. From there, he witnessed the arrival of spring, and recorded the blossoming of the surrounding landscape on his iPad, a method of drawing he has been using for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Drawing outdoors was an antidote to the anxiety of the moment for Hockney; \u201cwe need art, and I do think it can relieve stress,\u201d he says. This uplifting publication\u2014produced to accompany a major exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts\u2014includes 116 of these new iPad drawings and shows to full effect Hockney's singular skill in capturing the exuberance of nature. The book begins with an interview with the show's curator, Edith Devaney, in which Hockney discusses his heralding of the spring. It also features augmented reality, an exciting technology that enables smartphones and tablets to recognize printed images and play a related film or animation.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.75 x 6.75 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 168</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 140 color</li>\n</ul>",
