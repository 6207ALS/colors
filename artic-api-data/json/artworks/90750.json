    "description": "<p>Many recognizable buildings of the postmodern era capitalize on the sculptural and symbolic qualities of historical architecture, from the riotous landscape of neoclassical fragments in Charles Moore\u2019s Piazza d\u2019Italia of 1978 to the graphic evocation of giant-order columns in the 1982 Portland Building by Michael Graves. In Stanley Tigerman\u2019s Architoon sketches, references to historical buildings appear in fantastic environments populated by a mix of real and imagined buildings and figures. Although these drawings may initially appear as playful evocations of Tigerman\u2019s signature style, they are layered with dense references to architectural history, theology, bawdy humor, and his own personal narrative. In this sketch, for example, caryatids mingle with what appears to be a parachuting angel, and large column fragments support miniature versions of Tigerman\u2019s buildings, including the phallic Daisy House. Expressing the iconoclastic attitude of the era, the Architoons present a world in which monuments mingle with parking garages, and Classical architecture is subject to devious torments by Tigerman\u2019s many avatars.</p>\n",
