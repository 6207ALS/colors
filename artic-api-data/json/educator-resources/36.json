    "copy": " This abstract painting evokes the excitement of the first space missions in the 1960s and 1970s. Inspired by the Apollo missions, Thomas's thickly painted patches of vivid color against a white ground create a sensation of flickering light, suggesting the mysterious beauty of outer space and inspiring a sense of wonder. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
