    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  The subject of this vibrant portrait was a well-to-do Boston merchant and land speculator, named Richard Bill. The picture contains some clues to his profession. On the desk behind him you can see a quill pen and inkwell. He holds a letter in his hand, and there's another one on the desk, unopened and addressed to him. And there's a ship seen through the window, waiting to be loaded with cargo. Simply having his portrait painted is a sure sign of Richard Bill's prosperity. His long formal wig and ruffled shirt would have not have been worn by an average citizen. Look at the extravagant amount of velvet in his coat sleeves that fold back past the elbow, and the long vest underneath, which comes almost to his knees. And look at his pose, Richard Bill was a confident and powerful man. Equally interesting is the artist who portrayed him, John Smybert. After training in England, Smybert became the first painter of note in America. Also an architect, he completed the final design for Faneuil Hall in Boston, a city landmark still in use today.</p>\n",
