    "copy": " Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s Paris Street; Rainy Day is one of the landmark paintings of this era, and there are many things we know about it. We know why everyone is dressed so somberly\u2014outdoor clothing at this time was predominantly dark. We know where our pedestrians are\u2014the carrefour created by the intersection of the rues de Moscou, Turin, Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg, and Clapeyron. We know that this was a neighborhood extremely familiar to Caillebotte\u2014he lived not too far away on the rue de Miromesnil. And we know why it would appear that everyone has the same umbrella.   As you look across this monumental painting, you\u2019ll notice at least 13 (my unofficial count) virtually identical umbrellas, all seemingly made of gray silk over a steel frame. The journal Le Radical at the time suggested that the umbrellas could have been purchased from a department store like Le Bon March\u00e9 or Les Grands Magasins du Louvre. Thus the umbrellas of Paris Street; Rainy Day are just as real as the intersection Caillebotte depicts. Umbrellas\u2014newly widely available during this era\u2014conveyed some existential beliefs about city life. Writers of the day saw umbrellas not just as protective covers, but also a mark of anonymity in the hustle and bustle of city life. Compared to Paris\u2019s former tight streets and densely packed blocks, the \u201cnew Paris\u201d designed by Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann regularized the city into grand boulevards and turned entire blocks into standardized apartment buildings. Amidst this changing Paris, some feared that uniformity was replacing individual character and a sense of humanity was being lost. In this sense, Caillebotte\u2019s plethora of umbrellas that create literal space around their carriers suggest the creation of figurative space as well. And, in fact, all of the people in this painting\u2014together or not\u2014look alone. Interactions, even between the featured couple, seem nonexistent, with everyone in the painting occupying the respective bubbles created by their umbrellas. Some figures appear so deeply absorbed in their own worlds that they are about to crash into fellow pedestrians. Caillebotte might appear to be using umbrellas to picture a philosophical state as much as an urban scene. One thing we don\u2019t know about the painting is whether it\u2019s actually raining. Critics harped on this ambiguity at the time and argued with one another about whether the painting depicted a fine drizzle, the aftermath of a rainstorm, or even snow. \u2014Katie Rahn ",
