    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This imposing desk gives us a vivid insight into the poetic view of China seen in 18th Century European decorative arts known as shinwasarri [ph?], Western imagery of this kind was inspired by authentic art imported from Asia.  But interpreted by European artists and craftsmen, China becomes a land of the imagination filled with graceful figures, exotic plants and pavilions.  Here in the central panel above the desk lid, a figure shaded by a parasol walks through a building in picturesque dilapidation.  Notice how the vertical forms of the palm tree above him and the branches on the side panels echo the tall lines of the desk itself.  The desk is the work of David Roentgen.  Roentgen's workshop was in his native Germany but he travelled widely, established a lucrative shop in Paris and was appointed cabinet maker to Queen Mary Antoinette of France shortly after he made this desk.  Roentgen was especially adept at inlay techniques.  We can appreciate his skill in the extraordinary inlaid imagery here such as the fine differentiation of shaded folds in the people's clothing and the delicate curving forms of leaves and grasses.</p>\n",
