    "description": "<p>The history of American silver offers invaluable insights into the economic\u00a0and cultural history of the nation itself. Published here for the first time, the\u00a0Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s superb collection embodies innovation and beauty\u00a0from the colonial era to the present. In the 17th century, silversmiths\u00a0brought the fashions of their homelands to the colonies, and in the early\u00a018th, new forms arose as technology diversified production. Demand\u00a0increased in the 19th century as the Industrial Revolution took hold. In the\u00a020th, modernism changed the shape of silver inside and outside the home.\u00a0This beautifully illustrated volume presents highlights from the collection\u00a0with stunning photography and entries from leading specialists. In-depth\u00a0essays relate a fascinating story about eating, drinking, and entertaining that\u00a0spans the history of the Republic and trace the development of the Art\u00a0Institute\u2019s holdings of American silver over nearly a century.</p><p>266 pages with 169 color illustrations and 151 black and white illustrations</p><p>Hardcover: 9 1/2\" x 12\" x 1\"</p>",
