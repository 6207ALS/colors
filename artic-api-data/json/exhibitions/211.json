    "short_description": "Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864\u20131901), one of the most popular and important painters of late-19th-century Paris, has not been the subject of a major exhibition since the large retrospective presented in London and Paris in 1991 and 1992. The National Gallery of Art and the Art Institute of Chicago have collaborated to organize Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre, an exhibition that places the artist's work at the peak of his career between 1888 and 1896 in conjunction with the work of other artists of the period.",
