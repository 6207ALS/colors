    "description": "<p>After the Comet of Charles V failed to reappear in the 1840s, as astronomers predicted, a Belgian almanac writer announced that it would arrive on June 13, 1857, when it would collide with the earth and end all life. The prediction spread across Europe, but its effect was particularly pronounced in Paris, where terrified families began to prepare for the end. The situation was ripe for mockery, and it also enabled Daumier to compose a variety of night scenes, which he particularly enjoyed drawing. In this print, he devotes particular care to depicting how the candle illuminates his panicked Parisians.</p>\n",
