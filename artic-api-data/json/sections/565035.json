The variations seem almost endless, and the patterns range from strikingly bold (as in cat. 85 and cat. 86) to a more overall pattern (as in cat. 84). The shape was fabricated in many sizes that must have served as smaller sauce containers to drinking vessels and smaller serving bowls, all with some variation on the characteristic outsplayed rim and double carinated profile.\n\nCompare these fragments with the complete mosaic bowl (cat. 83), and the monochrome examples (cat. 81 and cat. 82). The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has a fragment (fig. 1) with ground and cane configuration similar to cat. 85. Another example in the Met (fig. 2) has a pattern similar to cat. 86.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. no. 17.194.396.18, mosaic fragment with an opaque white outline surrounding a similar cane; acc. no. 17.194.396.18, mosaic fragment with a related matrix and similar cane with a reversed central color pattern.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Four fragments of patella cups, all late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D., clockwise from top left: cat. 84, cat. 85, cat. 86, cat. 87.\n\nfig. 1 Mosaic Glass Fragment, late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D.
