Blunden is the chief architect and founder of Arcadia Homes, a sustainable cohousing community in which all thirty-three residences have passive solar design (non-mechanical solar heating achieved through site selection and large south-facing windows) and some active solar elements (collecting the sun\u2019s rays by appropriate technology to provide heat, mechanical power or electricity).\n\nIn addition to its solar features, Arcadia is a pedestrian-friendly community that preserved nine acres of climax hardwood forest when it was built, by clustering houses on land covered with secondary-growth pine trees. The distinctive architecture of the community derives from vernacular local millhouse structures.\n\nIn 2003 the share of all electricity produced by solar cell technology in the US was 0.07 percent\u2014though as far back as 1979 President Jimmy Carter announced (at a press conference held on the White House roof) the goal of bringing sun, wind and other renewable resources-generated electricity to twenty percent of the US total by the year 2000. In contrast, Japan, where fossil fuels are much more expensive, generated four times the amount of solar electricity produced in the US.\n\nAs solar power approaches a cost of $2 per watt, it is becoming less expensive than commercial power. Thirty-eight states, including North Carolina, have enacted \u201cnet metering\u201d laws that require utilities to connect residential solar panels into the grid and to compensate homeowners for any excess electricity they produce. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
