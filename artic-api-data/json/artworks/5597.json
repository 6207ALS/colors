On the back (reverse), a bust of Cleopatra is portrayed, facing to the right.</p>\n<p>Through Cleopatra, Egypt became involved in the chaotic political struggles of the Roman civil war, in which Julius Caesar, Mark Antony, and Octavian sought to control Egypt\u2019s wealth of grain and gold. Eventually this led to the end of Egypt\u2019s existence as a sovereign nation as well as the destruction of the Ptolemaic dynasty. This coin was struckafter Antony and Cleopatra had married and joined forces to fight Octavian. A year later, in 31 BCE. Octavian would defeat the pair at the Battle of Actium, and the ruling dynasty begun by Ptolemy would end with Cleopatra\u2019s death in 30 BCE.</p>\n",
