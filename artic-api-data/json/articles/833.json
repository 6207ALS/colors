    "title": "The Solace of Chinese Celadons",
    "copy": " I originally encountered celadons\u2014named for the color of their soft green glazes\u2014many decades ago while still a student in England. I was mesmerized by their subtle and subdued tones, so soothing on the eye, and amazed that they were so old\u2014some over a thousand years\u2014yet seemed so modern.   Many celadons, like the sublime vase above, rely purely on glaze and elegant form. In the West until the 20th century, decoration was a hallmark of value\u2014the more decoration, the better. But with these celadons, the opposite is the case: decoration is subservient to glaze, or even considered a distraction and totally eliminated.   This vase was created in south China sometime in the 14th century, while the country was under the rule of the Mongols, and probably imitated a metalwork form crafted in bronze. On the bronze original the ring handles would have been movable and could have been used to suspend the piece, but here they are frozen in place by the thick glaze.   We don\u2019t know who originally owned the piece, but it may well have been a member of the Chinese scholar class. At the time, scholars were disbarred from their traditional roles as government officials. The soothing tones of this vase, I can imagine, might have comforted the owner and his friends as they wrestled with their diminished status. They would certainly have admired it as the epitome of ya , or elegance. This exquisite work\u2014and other celadons in the collection\u2014still speak to us across the centuries. In contemplating their beauty, I hope that you, like many others before you, find a quiet moment of peace. \u2014Colin C. Mackenzie, curator of Chinese art ",
