    "transcript": "<p>Jonathan Tavares: This may shock most people when they come into the installation, and I have had the question many times, \u201cDid they send toddlers into battle?\u201d</p>\n<p>&lt;musical underlay begins&gt;</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator, Jonathan Tavares.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Tavares: Of course, that\u2019s not &lt;laughs&gt; what happened.  What we\u2019re looking at here is sort of training wheels for little noblemen.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Professor of Medieval History, Jonathan Lyon.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Lyon: We might best imagine this as, for example, the parents who buy a tuxedo for their young child, knowing that child may never wear it more than once or twice, but for important occasions it can be important for us too to still have our children dressed in a way that displays their importance and their status.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Tavares: This is to show the young prince as the heir apparent, as the next generation of noble prince that is going to be a commander of court but also military.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Lyon: I think the second aspect of this is that lords, kings, noblemen, also wanted to help the child understand that he was going to be carrying on this tradition.  To already start to instill in a young heir that idea that he has to follow in the footsteps of his father, his grandfather, his great grandfather, and that he needed to live up to the family tradition.</p>\n",
