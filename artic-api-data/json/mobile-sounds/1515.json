    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  In Ecuador, there's a volcano called Cotopaxi, and it held a strong attraction for the American painter Frederic Church. He traveled to South America to sketch it, and he painted it at least 10 times. His intention was to create a vision of paradise. The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts.<br>Ellen Roberts:  Church was very influenced by the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. And von Humboldt had come out with a book called &quot;Kosmos&quot; in 1848, which many painters read. To look at a beautiful landscape like this, is to see proof of the existence of God. Von Humboldt encouraged painters like Church to go find these wilderness areas that still existed in the 19th century, so they're meant to remind you of the Garden of Eden, of earthly paradise. He tries to make the composition very readable. You have this palm tree that's clearly the foreground, and then you have the waterfall in the middle ground, and the volcano is in the background. So it's very easy for your eye to travel backward into the space, and understand it.<br>Narrator:  Although Church's painting is very convincing, Cotopaxi was not surrounded by lush vegetation at all. The artist created a sort of ideal synthetic landscape, to better inspire the viewer.&quot;</p>\n",
