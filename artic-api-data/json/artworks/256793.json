    "description": "<p>Patterned woven wool fabrics were employed for both upholstery and clothing. The city of Norwich, in Norfolk, is commonly known as the primary center for weaving wool in the 18th century. Fine woolen textiles were the backbone of the English economy for hundreds of years, from the late middle ages until well into the 19th century. Britain\u2019s North American colonies provided a ready market for luxury goods like these patterned wool fabrics. In fact, <a href=\"https://emuseum.history.org/objects/31602\">a dress in the collection of Colonial Williamsburg</a> is made of a very similar textile (inventory number 1988.223).</p>\n",
