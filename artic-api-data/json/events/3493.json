    "description": "<p>Today's cultural organizations strive to provide programming that reflects and resonates with local communities and the larger world. In the pursuit of continued relevance, what can the stewards of these spaces do to create a responsive environment that is in step with the public's needs and expectations? How might they foster an inclusive space that gives rise to shared ownership and representation? What role can the community play in this process, and how will a shift toward greater social engagement impact the role and work of art institutions broadly? </p><p>Join educator Kamilah Rashied and panelists Lauren Pacheco, Claire Rice, Norman Teague, and Fo Wilson as they explore the shifting role of the community as collaborator and co-author of Chicago\u2019s socially driven cultural landscape. </p><p>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event. </p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p><p> </p>",
