Christopher was nine years old. \n\nClarence Harmon, the Chief of Police of St. Louis, started a program to buy back guns from the community in order to build a memorial to Harris. Over seven thousand guns were purchased, melted down, and cast into this statue, sculpted by Rudolph Torrinni.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
