    "transcript": "<p>Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is an oil painting on linen created by Amy Sherald in 2018. The<br>painting is roughly six feet tall and five feet wide. Michelle Obama, the former First Lady of the United<br>States, seated against a solid, pale blue background. She is centered on the canvas and wears a<br>sleeveless black and white dress with colored accents in a geometric print like you might find on a quilt.<br>Her skin is rendered in shades of gray with subtle modeling that indicates the contours of her face and<br>arms.<br>Her hair, parted in the middle, falls in large, buoyant waves just past her bare shoulders. The lobe of her<br>left ear, sporting a pearl earring, is just visible. Her face is shown in three-quarter view, her facial<br>expression serious. She gazes out of the canvas, making eye contact with the viewer. Her right arm is<br>sharply bent, her elbow on her lap and her wrist curved under her chin. We can see three fingernails on<br>her right hand, polished in cornflower blue. Her left arm cuts in front of her body, bent at a 90-degree<br>angle at the elbow with her forearm draped over her bent knee.</p>\n<p>The flowing skirt of Michelle Obama\u2019s dress expands in a triangular shape to occupy the lower portion of<br>the canvas, extending beyond the bottom edge of the composition. Black, and gray triangles and<br>semicircles are distributed across the white base of the fabric, accented by stripes of red, pink, and<br>yellow.</p>\n",
