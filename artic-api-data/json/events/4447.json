    "description": "<p>Women and Social Action </p><p>This month we\u2019ll discuss the role of women in social action, taking as a point of departure the exhibition, <a href=\"/exhibitions/9039/the-people-shall-govern-medu-art-ensemble-and-the-anti-apartheid-poster\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The People Shall Govern! Medu Art Ensemble and the Anti-Apartheid Poster</em></a>. In South Africa, posters called attention to social injustice and argued for the rights of women under apartheid law. Join educator Nenette Luarca-Shoaf and curator Felicia Mings to consider how the dynamic imagery of posters, as well as social media, memes, and television shows have catalyzed dialogue and activism about women\u2019s rights.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s globe-spanning collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Facilitators select featured artworks, which they will post here in advance of each discussion. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art.</p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
