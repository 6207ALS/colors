Here the view is through a large doorway into a dusky, beamed interior. The areas of deepest shadow reveal the pronounced grain of the transfer paper on which the image was sketched. Whistler made repeated corrections to the standing figure at right, and may have considered making some subtractive alterations to the stone after the initial proofs had been pulled. This is suggested by an impression in Glasgow in which portions of the printed surface have been scraped away to clarify the legs of the standing figure at right and an area of the bent figure\u2019s back (fig. 27a). Apparently the artist decided against further work on the stone, and probably had the drawing erased almost immediately. It was printed together with four other subjects (cat. 23, cat. 24, cat. 25, cat. 26, and cat. 27) on 8 June 1888 (app. II.3 and app. II.4). T. R. Way (1905) erroneously reported only six impressions of The Farriers.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove proofing paper (286 \u00d7 221 mm); MWC, cream Japanese paper (289 \u00d7 222 mm).
