Robinson, 1946.1057\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent brown glass. Blown, tooled, and wheel-cut. The rim is flared, cracked off, and slightly ground. The mouth tapers into a slightly convex body that spreads gently outward before bending in and down to a flattened pad base. A slightly indented underside has a possible ground pontil. There are wheel-abraded lines below the rim with a wide wheel-cut groove just above the center of the body and a small wheel-cut groove above and below. A third wheel-cut groove highlights the greatest diameter of the body before the wall bends in and down to the base. For a zoomable image, see fig. 125.1.\n\nThe piece is intact, with light-brown weathering product that retains patches of iridescence overall. There is some pitting. Strain cracking on the interior follows the wheel-cut grooves.\n\nThis is a solid drinking vessel with simple decoration. It fits easily in the hand but could just as easily have been a small storage jar. It is not a particularly common form, and the color is unusual for later Roman glass; the glass jug in the collection (cat. 118) is of the same brown color.\n\nClasina Isings describes this beaker as a jar with thinner walls but a related shape. There are three beakers in the Museum Kunstpalast in D\u00fcsseldorf that relate to this form, one more closely than the other two. There are two beakers in the Corning Museum of Glass that date to this later period and are compared to Isings\u2019s form 109a. A diminutive beaker of this form is in the Newark Museum in New Jersey.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 160, form 131.\n\nSaldern, Glassammlung Hentrich, pp. 162\u201363, nos. 247\u201349, all dated to the first to second centuries A.D. although they are probably later.

Saldern compares the shape to Isings form 34, which is more tapered and an earlier type of beaker.\n\nWhitehouse, Roman Glass 1, p. 248, no. 422, and relevant bibliography; Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 136, form 109a.
