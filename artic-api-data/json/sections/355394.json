Samuel is probably the figure on the left, and Thomas is at the right working the bellows. The two men are also depicted together in The Strong Arm (cat. 125), drawn a few days earlier. The vantage point that Whistler selected for The Brothers closely resembles that of The Blacksmith (cat. 127), and it is likely that both drawings were made during the same visit to the Govier smithy. The two images were transferred to stone and proved by the Ways on 8 October 1895 (app. II.4), along with The Old Smith\u2019s Story (cat. 129). Whistler had received the first proofs from the printers by October 10 and was disappointed with the way the images had transferred (letter 145).\n\nThe Brothers is one of four Lyme Regis blacksmith subjects (cat. 121, cat. 123, cat. 127, and cat. 128) that Whistler considered elaborating by producing secondary drawings to be transferred to supplementary stones. There are two proofs of the first state in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, bearing registration marks that the Ways added to the stone at the artist\u2019s request. Whistler made graphite additions to one of these impressions, as well as to another in Chicago (Palmer), suggesting that he had started to plan the changes he would make using a second transfer drawing. However, the scheme to develop the four smith images using supplementary stones was never carried beyond this point.\n\nWhistler did eventually revise both The Brothers and The Blacksmith. The additional work was done directly on the original stones at the Way offices, after Whistler had returned to London from Lyme Regis in late December 1895. The Brothers was not included in the Fine Art Society\u2019s exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, which opened in mid-December 1895, in all likelihood because the artist had not yet completed his revisions on the stone.\n\nIn the first state the image is shown as originally drawn and transferred, before Whistler made additions directly on the stone. It is this state that is illustrated in the Edward Kennedy (1914) and Levy (1975) catalogues.\n\nChicago: Palmer, cream wove proofing paper (254 \u00d7 194 mm), signed, with graphite additions in the face and neck of the figure at left, between his right arm and side, and in the shaded area directly below the figure at right. Glasgow: HAG (3), ivory wove proofing paper (291 \u00d7 191 mm), with \u00d7-shaped registration marks at all four corners of the image, and with graphite additions in the face of the figure at left, between his proper right arm and side, and below his right arm; ivory wove proofing paper (291 \u00d7 254 mm), with +-shaped registration marks centered on all four sides of the image; cream laid paper (247 \u00d7 183 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in New York, MMA.\n\nWhistler made several discrete additions directly on the stone. Small areas of tone have been added to Samuel Govier\u2019s face and neck. Hatched lines have been added under his arm and hatching also extends the darkened area to his left. Series of parallel lines have been added on the wall above the recess to strengthen the effect of flickering light and shadow radiating from the forge. A few strokes have been added on the right to define the side of the furnace and to suggest smoke. Some crayon work has been added within the darkened recess to provide an additional sense of depth.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 229 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (288 \u00d7 230 mm).
