An organizer for the Food and Canning Workers Union, Aggett was detained by South African police on November 17, 1981. During his 70 days in detention, Aggett was repeatedly interrogated and tortured. On February 5, 1982, he was found dead in his prison cell, allegedly having hanged himself. Aggett\u2019s death catalyzed a nationwide work stoppage and international condemnation\u2014a level of protest unprecedented since the founder of the Black Consciousness movement, Steve Biko, died in detention in 1977. Twenty thousand people attended Aggett\u2019s funeral.</p>\n",
