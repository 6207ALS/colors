    "description": "<p>The Art Institute of Chicago houses one of the world's most beautiful and comprehensive collections of Japanese woodblock prints in the world. Clarence Buckingham, of the famed Chicago family, donated 12,000 prints alone. The book covers this exquisite collection of work from the 17th to 19th centuries in four sections: Primitives, Courtesans, Actors, and Landscapes. It includes work by well-known masters such as Hiroshige, Hokusai, and Utamaro, as well as lesser-known talents such as Shun'ei, Shunko, and Kiyonaga. While the trim size is small, none of the subtle colors, delicate paper texture, or intricate fabric design is lost.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Hardcover</strong></li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4 x 4.38 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 320</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 280 full-color</li></ul>",
