    "description": "<p>Albert Pinkham Ryder was one of the most innovative artists of the late 19th century, creating reductive, yet expressive compositions out of thick, slowly worked paint, combined with glazes, varnishes, and unconventional materials. In <em>The Essex Canal</em>, a waterway faintly meanders from the green-hued foreground to a skim of blue along the horizon, with an expansive sky beyond. A younger generation of American artists celebrated Ryder as an important early modernist, who pushed toward abstraction and focused on the arduous process of painting itself as instrumental to one\u2019s creative vision. Ryder\u2019s reclusiveness only added to his intrigue and mythic status as an artist ahead of his time.</p>\n",
