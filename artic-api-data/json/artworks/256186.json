    "description": "<p>This painting belongs to a sequence of portraits by Samuel De Wilde depicting famous British actors performing their best-known roles. Designed to serve as the model for a print marketed to the general public, the painting is a significant artifact in the historical development of celebrity culture. The subject of the portrait, John Quick, was among the most acclaimed comic actors of his generation and is shown here in the role of Vellum from Joseph Addison\u2019s 1716 play, The Drummer. With a ruddy complexion and wig humorously askew, Quick is shown in the act of performing, seated in a spare interior and glancing stage left, perhaps at another character about to enter.</p>\n",
