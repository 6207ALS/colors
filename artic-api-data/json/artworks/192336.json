    "description": "<p>Roni Horn makes sculptures, drawings, and photographic works that are derived from the physical characteristics of the materials she employs and are often inspired by the natural environment. She describes the thinking behind this work: \u201cWhen you stand by . . . any body of water\u2014an ocean, a lake\u2014there\u2019s a whole history of reverie that clicks on . . . . Rather than an object, water becomes a form\u2014 of consciousness, of time, of physicality, of the human condition, of anything I desire to project on it, of anything I want it to be.\u201d Deeps and Skies is simultaneously dense and reflective, evoking the fluidity of the molten glass before it solidified during the casting process.</p>\n",
