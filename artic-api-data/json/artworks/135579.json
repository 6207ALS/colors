    "description": "<p>Known principally as a ceramicist, Ken Price emerged with a group of Los Angeles\u2013based surfer-artists in the sixties that included, among others, Ed Ruscha, Robert Irwin, and Larry Bell. Price\u2019s three-dimensional work consists predominantly of ceramic cups and polymorphous sculptures that emphasize clean lines, smooth surfaces, and colorful glazes. These aesthetic principles carry over into his two dimensional works as well, as his illustrations for Harvey Mudd\u2019s book-length poem <em>The Plain of Smokes</em> demonstrate. The poem\u2014written in four parts, from four different points of view, in four very different styles\u2014is an ode to the Los Angeles that shaped both the artist and the poet. <em>The Plain of Smokes</em> was a true artist\u2013poet collaboration\u2014each motivating revisions in the other\u2019s work. Price, for example, responded specifically to Mudd\u2019s verse with <em>Smiling Bather</em>, and after seeing Price\u2019s image <em>Club Zebra</em>, Mudd reworked the poem to include it.</p>\n",
