    "title": "Marcel Duchamp\u2019s Bottle Rack",
    "copy": " In 1913, French artist and provocateur Marcel Duchamp made a decisive break with art making. It was the year of the Armory Show, the infamous exhibition that introduced Chicago, New York, and Boston to Duchamp and fellow revolutionaries of the European avant-garde such as Br\u00e2ncusi, Gauguin, Matisse, and Picasso. Up to this point, Duchamp had painted nudes and portraits in Post-Impressionist and Fauvist styles, but he wanted something beyond what he called \u201cretinal art,\u201d art that was meant to simply please the eye with colors, textures, and exotic subjects. Instead, he sought to \u201cput painting once again at the service of the mind.\u201d In his studio that same year, Duchamp had the \u201chappy idea\u201d to mount a bicycle wheel upside down on a kitchen stool, transforming two practical objects into a third impractical object and placing it in the realm of art. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any special reason to do it,\u201d he later recalled. Bicycle Wheel served as a distraction: \u201cLike having a fireplace in the studio,\u201d the artist said, \u201cthe movement of the wheel reminded me of the movement of the flames.\u201d   The following year, Duchamp took the idea a step further when he bought a common, mass-produced bottle rack at a department store and, without altering its form, proclaimed it to be a work of art. He called this type of work a \u201creadymade,\u201d an ordinary object\u2014sometimes found or mass-produced\u2014that was transformed into art by Duchamp\u2019s selection of it. This seemingly simple action revolutionized the art world, raising philosophical questions of lasting importance: What is art? What is it, exactly, that artists do? And who gives their work meaning?   When Duchamp moved to New York in 1915, he left the readymade known as Bottle Rack and other works in his Paris studio, which he entrusted to his sister, the artist Suzanne Duchamp. Writing to Suzanne in 1916, Duchamp asked her to sign Bottle Rack for him with a now-unknown inscription and to send it to New York. By the time Suzanne received her brother\u2019s letter, she had already discarded the object. The idea, however, had not been lost. Since the \u201coriginality\u201d of Bottle Rack had already been challenged by its very origin as a mass-produced item, Duchamp acquired and authorized new versions.   \ufeff The version acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago at the beginning of this year was selected by Duchamp for the 1959 exhibition Art and the Found Object in New York. Artist Robert Rauschenberg acquired Bottle Rack after the touring exhibition, and in 1960, asked Duchamp to sign it. He obliged, writing in French, \u201cImpossible for me to recall the original phrase M.D./Marcel Duchamp/1960.\u201d Over the years, Rauschenberg proudly displayed Bottle Rack in his studio, remarking that Duchamp\u2019s \u201crecognition of the lack of art in art and the artfulness of everything\u201d was among his most important contributions to the art of our time.   The presence of Bottle Rack in the Art Institute\u2019s galleries also pays tribute to Duchamp\u2019s long-standing and distinguished relationship with the museum. A friend and advisor to Katharine Kuh, the museum\u2019s first curator of modern art, Duchamp played a special role in the gift of the prestigious Mary Reynolds Collection of Surrealism in 1951. Through his support, Br\u00e2ncusi\u2019s Leda (1923) entered the collection as a gift from Katherine S. Dreier\u2019s estate in 1953, and in 1990, Br\u00e2ncusi\u2019s Golden Bird (1919/20) , which Duchamp had included in a historic 1927 exhibition at the Arts Club of Chicago, also became part of the museum\u2019s collection.   Today, it is hard to imagine the seismic shift in the world of art that was inspired by Duchamp\u2019s idea of the readymade. The museum\u2019s acquisition of Bottle Rack redefines the storytelling power of the Art Institute\u2019s collection; perhaps no other work occupies such an exalted position within, between, and at the forefront of so many pivotal moments in modern and contemporary art.
