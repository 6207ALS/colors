    "description": "<p>Join Jonathan Tavares, associate curator of Applied Arts of Europe; Emily Fry, director of Interpretation; and Anibal Rodriguez, anthropology associate, American Museum of Natural History, for a deeper look into the materials and the material conditions that contributed to the creation of the <a href=\"/artworks/34116/cabinet\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Augsburg Cabinet</a>. This elaborate work was crafted with ornate decorations made of ebony veneer and ivory inlay, materials deemed precious by 17th-century Western Europeans and that in the 21st century we recognize were acquired through the exploitation of the natural environment, and often the peoples who live there. Tavares, Fry, and Rodriguez will guide us through a conversation around the shifting unease and value sets this object encapsulates.</p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong><br></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.
