    "description": "<p>In 1839 Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre announced the perfection of the daguerreotype, a photographic process that employed a silver-coated copperplate sensitive to light. This new artistic process was celebrated for its remarkably sharp detail and praised as a \u201cdemocratic art\u201d that brought portraiture into reach for the masses. Within a few years, thousands of daguerrean portrait studios had sprung up all over the United States, among them the one that Samuel J. Miller owned in Akron, Ohio. Although most of the likenesses made in commercial studios were formulaic and not very revealing of the subject\u2019s character, this portrait of Frederick Douglass\u2014an escaped slave who had become a lauded speaker, writer, and abolitionist agitator\u2014is a striking exception. Northeastern Ohio was a center of abolitionism prior to the Civil War, and Douglass knew that this picture, one of an astonishing number that he commissioned or posed for, would be seen by ardent supporters of his campaign to end slavery. Douglass was an intelligent manager of his public image and likely guided Miller in projecting his intensity and sheer force of character. As a result, this portrait demonstrates that Douglass truly appeared \u201cmajestic in his wrath,\u201d as the nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton observed.</p>\n",
