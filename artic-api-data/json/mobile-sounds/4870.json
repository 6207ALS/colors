    "transcript": "<p>Over 5,000 years ago in North Africa, a vibrant culture arose in a land that its inhabitants called Kemet or the Black Land in reference to the fertile soil of the Nile River Valley. In the United States today, we know this region as Egypt.</p>\n<p>I'm Ashley Arico assistant curator of ancient Egyptian art in the department of Arts of Africa at The Art Institute of Chicago. Through a selection of artworks that span over 1500 years of ancient Egyptian history this guide will explore aspects of life and the afterlife along the Nile River during antiquity.</p>\n<p>While we celebrate these objects as works of art today, the artisans who made them crafted each with a specific function in mind. Some were created for religious worship, others to aid Egyptian men and women in achieving a bountiful afterlife, and still others to commemorate the lives of individuals so that they would be remembered long after their deaths. All have something to reveal about ancient Egyptian worldviews, which were shaped by the physical environment and indigenous plants and animals of Northern Africa. Just as your possessions reflect your identity and culture so did the ancient Egyptians. Each stop in this tour helps to uncover the beliefs and practices of the ancient peoples who commissioned these objects and provides glimpses of daily life in this ancient African culture.</p>\n",
