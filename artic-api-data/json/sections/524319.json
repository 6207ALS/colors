The two were Marcus Aurelius (Antoninus\u2019s own nephew) and Lucius Verus (the son of Hadrian\u2019s first choice), who dropped his original cognomen Commodus and took his colleague\u2019s original cognomen Verus instead. Upon acceding to the throne, Verus (r. A.D. 161\u201369) shared all titles and distinctions equally with his abler coruler (except for pontifex maximus). The coinage is easily dated by his tribunician years, assumed in December of each year. At the start of their joint reign, the mints employed similar images of the emperors in a similar fashion, or showed the two holding hands to signify that the emperors were of one accord.\n\nThe obverse inscription and reverse image of this coin vaunt Verus\u2019s victory over the Parthian army in Armenia, though he was in Antioch during that war; it seems he was better at letting good generals do their job than at campaigning himself. (The title Armeniacus was shared by Marcus Aurelius, though he modestly dropped it after Verus\u2019s death, since he himself had not been on that campaign.) On this coin, Victory holds a shield proclaiming the victory of the Augustus. But as he and his troops returned from the East, they brought with them a deadly plague that decimated Italy, especially in the cities and army camps. Verus soon joined his coemperor, Marcus Aurelius, on the Danube frontier but in 169 succumbed to disease, leaving Marcus sole emperor.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Yarrow, \u201cAntonine Coinage,\u201d p. 437. Marcus had changed his cognomen from Verus to Aurelius, to honor his adoptive father, whose name was T. Aurelius Antoninus Pius.\n\nThe legend on the reverse specifies that it was the fourth year of his tribunician power and that he was imperator for the second time and consul for the second time.\n\nRIC III, p. 196; Yarrow, \u201cAntonine Coinage,\u201d p. 438.\n\nProbably smallpox, as argued by Littman and Littman, \u201cGalen and the Antonine Plague.\u201d\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 56 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Lucius Verus, A.D. 163/64\n\n</section>",
