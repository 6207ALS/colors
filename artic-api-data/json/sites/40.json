    "title": "Belligerent Encounters: Graphic Chronicles of War and Revolution, 1500\u20131945",
    "description": "Wars and revolutions have been recorded in words and images for millennia, commemorated in architecture, sculpture, mosaics, frescoes, and tapestries. In Europe the advent of printing and printmaking in the 15th century meant that the chronicling of historical and contemporary conflicts was possible on a scale never before seen. Woodcuts, engravings, etchings, and lithographs depicting wars and revolutions can be seen as ancestors to the kinds of digital technologies that made this year\u2019s \u201cArab Spring\u201d a global event. Mainly drawn from the permanent collection of the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Department of Prints and Drawings, Belligerent Encounters includes European and American prints, posters, and drawings spanning almost 500 years of war and revolution. Some images\u2014by artists Jacques Callot, Albrecht D\u00fcrer, and Francisco de Goya\u2014 are quite famous; others by Otto Dix and \u00c9douard Manet may be familiar to some viewers; and a number by Frank Brangwyn, Albin Egger-Lienz, Heinrich Hoerle, and Jan Poortenaar will be unknown to many people. While some of the works on display were conceived to stand on their own, a number come from thematic portfolios whose contents were intended to be viewed together. These include Max Beckmann\u2019s Hell (Die H\u00f6lle), 1919; Otto Dix\u2019s War (Der Krieg), 1924; and Heinrich Hoerle\u2019s Cripples Portfolio (Die Kr\u00fcppel), 1920.",
