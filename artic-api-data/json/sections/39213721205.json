It is a sea of oil paint, given movement purely by glints of different shades of white, blue, and turquoise applied with light touches of the brush. The sky seems to be held in check by luminous clouds whose shadows are cast over the darkly silhouetted ships. Sunlight through a few breaks in the clouds causes the white of a sail to glow and the silvery chimney stack of a steamboat to gleam. The shadows of the heavy swirls of smoke lie on the water\u2019s surface. Boats of all shapes and sizes stretch into the depth of the painting till they are no more than tiny specks on the horizon. They seem to have been arranged by the artist with decorative care, though also with deliberate precision: a cross is formed by two diagonal lines, one created by the three principal sailboats, and the other by the wake of the steamboat. Set high in the composition, the horizon line forms a third axis that pulls the viewer\u2019s gaze into the distance and accentuates the sensation of unbounded space. With Sea View, Calm Weather we are most certainly in the presence of a \u201ccomposition [that] is the vision of a man accustomed to experiencing the sea from on board ship, not from the shore.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Manet was familiar with the sea. At the age of sixteen, the artist had little desire to follow the judicial career envisaged for him by his father. He boarded the training boat Le Havre et Guadeloupe to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, intending to take the entrance examination for the French naval school. His decision to go into the navy\u2014most likely a compromise between his personal wishes and his parents\u2019 demand that he enter a career appropriate to the Parisian grande bourgeoise, to which the Manet family belonged\u2014evinces the future painter\u2019s lifelong fondness for the sea. During this crossing, which lasted from December 1848 to June 1849, Manet soaked up the marine environment. Subject to the uncertainties of the winds and ocean, the voyage seems to have made a lasting impression on the young man and nurtured the impressions that would inform his painting. In the letters Manet sent to his family from the Le Havre et Guadeloupe, the painter\u2019s emotional response to the beauty of the ships and to the view of the sparkling water is already evident: \u201cWe board a charming skiff,\u201d he wrote to his mother from his boat in Le Havre harbor,\u201cto travel to the port of Rio de Janeiro. I say again to you, I am sorry that you did not see our ship: it is one of the loveliest and best designed in Le Havre.\u201d And much later, when out at sea, \u201cThis evening the sea was more phosphorescent than usual, the ship seemed to slice through blades of fire; it was very beautiful.\u201d\n\nManet\u2019s first biographer, Edmond Bazire, would later remark that on this boat Manet, \u201cwith an equal and cheerful mood, never undisciplined, . . . looked at the infinite [expanse], filling his eyes with the wonderful spectacle of waves and horizons,\u2014never to forget it.\u201d The painter himself would confirm the importance of this voyage for his artistic training: \u201cIt was not at school that I learnt to construct a picture. . . . But I learnt a great deal during my voyage to Brazil. I spent night after night watching the play of light and shade in the wake of the ship. During the day I watched the line of the horizon. That taught me how to plan out a sky.\u201d More importantly, then, it was on this ship that Manet understood his artistic vocation. The trip to Rio convinced him to become a painter\u2014the painter that would overturn the canons of his time. This is what we are given to understand by Antonin Proust, the friend whom Manet had met in the classrooms of the Coll\u00e8ge Rollin: \u201cHis convictions [on the matter of painting] were fixed, unshakeable. He admitted of neither contradictions, nor even discussion. His short sojourn in southern, sunnier countries had inspired him with a conception such that everything appeared to him with a simplicity which [his teacher Thomas] Couture did not understand.\u201d\n\nLike Manet\u2019s other seascapes, Sea View, Calm Weather is marked by the memories of this Atlantic crossing as well as by those of his regular visits to the French coast. It was during his holidays by the sea that Manet filled his sketchbooks with motifs and ideas that he would use later in his painted seascapes (fig. 3.1; [RW II 224]). Boulogne-sur-Mer was one of the coastal resorts that the painter and his family visited during the 1860s. Frequented by both Parisians and foreigners, the former came in large numbers following the extension of the Paris railway line to Boulogne in 1848, while international visitors arrived in droves during the summer months. Holidaymakers from England in particular took advantage of the steam-driven ferry that made regular crossings. Manet, who \u201cadore[d] society and . . . found secret pleasure in the perfumed and glittering refinements of soir\u00e9es,\u201d enjoyed the light and atmosphere on the coast so much that he did not overly miss Paris.\n\nThe biographical notes drawn up by L\u00e9on Leenhoff at the start of the twentieth century confirm that Manet made two trips to Boulogne-sur-Mer, in 1864 and 1868. Scholars have long thought that these visits were the occasions on which he painted his works showing the sea at Boulogne, including the painting in the Art Institute of Chicago. However, it now seems that Manet\u2019s stays in this resort may have been more frequent. Manet\u2019s letters indicate that the town was familiar to the Manet family even before the artist\u2019s voyage to Rio. Further, in 1860 Manet showed The Students of Salamanca (fig. 3.2; private collection, [RW I 28]) at his exhibition at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis des arts de Boulogne-sur-Mer, and it is very probable that the artist journeyed to the town for the occasion. Lastly, it is likely that his stays in Boulogne were also therapeutic. There are several indications that the disease responsible for his death (syphilis) did not appear in 1879, as stated by L\u00e9on Leenhoff. Illness may have manifested much earlier; Manet\u2019s letters mention visits to the coastal town in the 1860s so that he could benefit from the hydrotherapeutic facilities there. The artist apparently stayed in Boulogne, alone or at least without his family, on occasions that Leenhoff either did not mention or was unaware of because they were related to Manet\u2019s disease, an aspect of his life that was too intimate for Leenhoff to address.\n\nGiven this situation, it becomes more difficult to date Sea View, Calm Weather securely. We can, however, attempt to trace its history. The first mention made of this painting is probably the entry in the list of works sent by the painter to Louis Martinet regarding the exhibition to be held in the gallery of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale des Beaux-Arts in February 1865 (fig. 3.3). Two of the nine canvases listed were seascapes, and were titled La mer, le navire f\u00e9d\u00e9ral Kerseage [sic] en rade de Boulogne-sur-mer\u2014now known as The \u201cKearsarge\u201d at Boulogne (fig. 3.4; [RW I 75])\u2014and La mer, which may be the Chicago painting. In the end, the exhibition was not held. But if the second work had indeed been Sea View, Calm Weather, it is probable that it was painted during Manet\u2019s stay in Boulogne in 1864, or shortly thereafter. On June 19 of that year, two warships fighting in the American Civil War arrived off the coast of Cherbourg and stimulated a frenzy in France, particularly among marine painters. Manet himself was inspired to paint The Battle of the USS \u201cKearsarge\u201d and the CSS \u201cAlabama\u201d (fig. 3.5; [RW I 76]) in Paris before he left in July for Boulogne, where he was able to admire the USS Kearsarge as it lay at anchor in front of the town. While in Boulogne, Manet wrote to the journalist Philippe Burty that he had \u201cvisited\u201d the USS Kearsarge and \u201cpainted her as she looks out at sea.\u201d To his friend, the engraver F\u00e9lix Bracquemond, he added, \u201cI\u2019ve done some studies of small boats on the open sea.\u201d It was during this visit to Boulogne that Manet painted The \u201cKearsarge\u201d at Boulogne (fig. 3.4; [RW I 75]), but also other seascapes, including Sea View, Calm Weather, which may have been one of the \u201cstudies of small boats on the open sea\u201d referred to by the painter. Technical analysis of the Chicago painting shows that Manet probably painted the canvas pinned on a flat surface and that it was only attached to a stretcher once it had been completed (see Stretching in technical report). Manet may have painted the work in his rented apartment in Boulogne or perhaps upon his return to Paris, where he pinned his paintings this way as well, perhaps due to a lack of space in his small studio on the rue Guyot. Whichever it was, the painting is a free composition constructed around a few scattered elements. The steam and white wake that trail from the steamboat seem to have been taken from a watercolor, Steamboat off Boulogne (fig. 3.6; [RW II 222]), and reprised by the artist in his 1868 work The Steamboat, Seascape with Porpoises (fig. 3.7; [RW I 79]). The ship in the foreground on the right in the Chicago painting is related to the fishing boat seen on the right in The \u201cKearsarge\u201d at Boulogne (fig. 3.4; [RW I 75]) and again in the etching Marine (fig. 3.8; [Harris 40]), which in turn takes up the motif of the porpoises in the aforementioned Philadelphia painting. The sailboats deftly depicted with a few brushstrokes are similar to the many sketches Manet made in his notebooks (fig. 3.9; [RW II 299] and fig. 3.10). This set of relationships prompted Anne Coffin Hanson to write: \u201cThough we cannot establish which work derives from which, we can conclude that Manet\u2019s seascapes of 1864 were not realistically painted on the scene but, like many of his figure paintings of the sixties, were constructed of motifs taken from other works.\u201d The painter Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche, who knew Manet during the 1870s, substantiated this notion when he wrote that the seascapes were not painted from the motif but were a \u201cre-creation\u201d in the studio.\n\nIn 1866 \u00c9mile Zola visited Manet\u2019s studio, where the painter had assembled \u201cthirty or so\u201d canvases that he hoped to show at the Exposition universelle of 1867. In the article Zola wrote immediately following his visit, he noted \u201ctwo very remarkable seascapes whose magnificent waves bear witness to the fact that the artist has sailed and loved the ocean.\u201d Zola\u2019s article, which was first published in La revue du XIX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle, reappeared in the form of a pamphlet when Manet decided to mount a private exhibition on the fringes of the Exposition universelle. In his 1867 Ed. Manet: \u00c9tude biographique et critique, Zola made a few modifications to the text, in particular relating to the seascapes. The author mentioned the presence of four sea views (no longer two) and gave their precise titles as they would be found in the catalogue of the private 1867 exhibition mounted by Manet at great expense close to the Pont de l\u2019Alma: le Steam-Boat; le Combat du Kerseage [sic] &amp; de l\u2019Alabama; Vue de mer, temps calme; and Bateau de p\u00eache arrivant vent arri\u00e8re. The precision of the titles shows that they were dictated to Zola by Manet and that the painter doubtless wished to attract attention to his seascapes. Indeed, these works would reconcile Manet with the critics, if not the public.\n\nOpened on May 24, 1867, the exhibition including the four seascapes identified by Zola received very little press coverage and consequently contemporary reports are rare. However, a satirical newspaper, Le Journal amusant, published a group of caricatures of the paintings Manet brought forward to the public. A sketch of the Art Institute\u2019s painting appeared in the newspaper under the number 34 with a title matching the painter\u2019s catalogue: Le Steam-boat (marine) (fig. 3.11). It is clearly a mistake by the caricaturist, and this mistake sowed confusion about the painting\u2019s title. The dimensions in the exhibition catalogue and most importantly the description by Th\u00e9odore Duret (who visited the 1867 exhibition) clarify the situation. Randon sketched number 40, in the catalogue Vue de mer, temps calme, but gave the title of another seascape exhibited by Manet, known today as Les Marsouins. The complimentary review by the critic Hippolyte Babou did not forget the seascapes: \u201cThere is, in Manet\u2019s work, an artist\u2019s intelligence . . . consider these large seascapes where the sea, without rocks, without coasts, without cliffs, gives a good idea of the infinite . . . has he not there a brilliant reflection of nature that goes right to the soul? You have before your eyes, I tell you, not only intelligence, but an artist\u2019s soul.\u201d The painting could be viewed by the public once again at the Exposition centennale de l\u2019Art fran\u00e7ais in 1900. Was this when Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche saw it? He seems to be speaking about Sea View, Calm Weather when he praises the artist\u2019s sea views: \u201cHis sea pieces are at once among the most splendid, the most real and the most living ever painted in the nineteenth century. No one has rendered better than he the jade green, the ocean skies, the black rigging of ships, the smoke of a passenger steamer.\u201d\n\nLater, Blanche remarked on the calligraphic, rhythmical, and decorative aspects of the painting, as well as on the rapidity and confidence with which Manet had executed it. For Richard Brettell, Sea View, Calm Weather \u201cis a work of an entirely, and higher, level of painterly experimentation. Its canvas is larger, its encapsulation of liquidity and movement is absolute, and its complete absence of mistakes or performative faults is extraordinary.\u201d Several authors have also drawn attention to the influence of Japanese art on the painting, with John Leighton suggesting the work of Utagawa Hiroshige as a possible source (see fig. 3.12).\n\nWith Sea View, Calm Weather, Manet succeeded in combining the influences of the art of the past (here, Japanese art mainly) with quickness and poise in the execution. As noted above, the painting was likely created during the prolific year of 1864, a period during which his trip to Boulogne seems to have played a catalyzing role, generating in particular the creation of a group of masterful seascapes. Undoubtedly, Manet\u2019s reunion with the ocean was crucial. Apparently, the painter quickly forgot the gibes he received at the Salon des Refus\u00e9s as well as those from the exhibition of Dejeuner sur l\u2019herbe the year before. Here, the marine wind of Boulogne seems to be in the painter\u2019s sail. Manet first acquired a taste for painting on the deck of a ship, contemplating the ocean, and in the Art Institute\u2019s seascape he had regained his enthusiasm alongside his singularity and talent.  \nSamuel Rodary\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Sea View, Calm Weather (Vue de mer, temps calme) was painted on a pre-primed no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. The ground is off-white and may consist of more than one layer. The surface of the ground has a distinct, diagonal brushmarked texture that remains visible in thinly painted passages of the composition. A series of pinholes present on all four sides just inside the edges of the painted composition indicates that the canvas was pinned down flat for painting and then later mounted on the current stretcher, which appears to retain the original tacking. The scalloped edge of the paint layer corresponds to the cusping of the canvas and confirms that the work was stretched after it was painted. The work appears to have been executed relatively rapidly: the sky was painted first in very thin layers; then the water was painted, covering the entire lower two-thirds of the canvas; and, finally, the boats were added wet-on-wet over the water. The area of the sailboat at the right edge of the composition is built up more densely than the rest of the painting, the result of some minor adjustments that include the widening of the front sail along the right edge and a possible change in the size or position of the boat. The artist scraped a border around the perimeter of the painting while the paint was still wet. This was done before the painting was mounted on the stretcher. In addition to the signature in the lower right corner, the artist\u2019s initials appear near the top of the dark-brown sail of the boat on the right. The painting is in near-pristine condition; it is unlined and appears to have never been removed from the stretcher.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 3.13).\n\nSigned: Manet (lower right corner, in green paint) (fig. 3.14). In addition, the initials E.M. were painted near the top of the brown sail of the far right boat (fig. 3.15). It appears that the monogram was first lightly painted in pale-gray paint and then reinforced using dark-brown paint (fig. 3.16). In both places, the painting was evidently dry when it was signed.\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe current dimensions correspond closely to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (92 \u00d7 73 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 20.8V (1.3) \u00d7 23.6H (0.6) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were determined with other Manet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild cusping on the left and right edges, and more pronounced cusping along the top and especially the bottom edges. The canvas has several nubs and thicker threads.\n\nCurrent stretching: It appears that the canvas was pinned to a flat surface while the painting was executed. There is a series of small pinholes around the edges of the painting, within the area of the subsequently scraped border (see Paint Application/Technique) (fig. 3.17). There are multiple holes in close proximity in a few areas (fig. 3.18), which suggest that the canvas was pinned down more than once. The canvas was mounted onto the current stretcher after it was painted, as evidenced by the fact that, on all four sides, the painted edge of the composition conforms to the secondary cusping pattern in the canvas, indicating that the canvas was stretched after the paint was applied (fig. 3.19). The painting appears to retain its original stretching with iron tacks spaced 2.5\u20139 cm apart (most 6\u20138 cm). A few copper tacks were added more recently. There are a few additional small holes in the tacking margins that all seem to correspond to small holes in the stretcher. The canvas shows no evidence of having been taken off the stretcher. The cusping corresponds to the placement of the original tacks on all sides except the bottom.\n\nOriginal stretching: See above.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher appears to be original to the painting (fig. 3.20). It is a five-membered, wooden stretcher with butt-ended, mortise and tenon corner joints and a vertical crossbar with exposed dovetail joints. There are ten keys. The inner edges of the members are chamfered. Stretcher bar dimensions: width, 6.7 cm; depth, 1.7 cm; crossbar dimensions: width, 6.7 cm; depth, 1.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of the left, right, and top tacking margins, but ends approximately 0.5\u20131.5 cm short of the bottom edge. This suggests that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric on three sides, while the bottom edge probably corresponds to the original edge of the larger canvas that was attached to the commercial priming frame. Examination of the X-ray and the back of the canvas shows that the ground was forced through tiny openings in the canvas weave (fig. 3.21). Overall, the ground has a distinct brushmarked texture that continues from the picture plane onto the tacking margins. The brushstrokes are oriented, for the most part, from upper left to lower right and are visible on the unpainted and scraped edges as well as in thinly painted passages of the composition (fig. 3.22, fig. 3.23). Several tiny bubble holes were observed in the ground where it is exposed on the surface of the painting.\n\nA cross section from the right tacking edge shows evidence of the presence of three layers of similar composition: two thin, higher-density layers composed of fine particles at the top and bottom, and a thicker one in between with a higher proportion of binder. Different areas of the cross sections were found to display differences in terms of packing density and relative proportions of binder to pigment. The fact that the layer boundaries are not always clear suggests that they were applied in quick sequence or even, in some cases, that they are the result of overlapping brushstrokes. (fig. 3.24). The thickness of the ground ranges from approximately 20\u2013115 \u00b5m.\n\nWarm, off-white with some dark particles visible microscopically (fig. 3.25, fig. 3.26).\n\nAll regions of the ground were found to have a similar composition: lead white and barium sulfate (barite) with calcium carbonate (chalk) and traces of silica and silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nAs mentioned above (see Stretching), it appears that the canvas was pinned to a flat surface while the painting was executed and then mounted on the stretcher. This is suggested by both a series of small pinholes around the edges of the picture plane (fig. 3.17) and the fact that the edges of the painting conform to the secondary cusping pattern in the canvas (fig. 3.19). The work seems to have been executed fairly quickly. The sky was painted in first, followed by the water, which covers the entire lower two-thirds of the canvas. Then the boats were added wet-on-wet over the water. Along the horizon, where the boats overlap the sky, the paint was already dry\u2014probably the result of fairly thin applications (fig. 3.27). In fact, in some areas the work is painted surprisingly thinly. This can be seen with transmitted illumination where the light shows through most of the sky and broad areas of the water (fig. 3.28). The sky consists of very thin layers of paint that allow both the off-white color and the brushmarked texture of the ground layer to show through (fig. 3.29). The water has an overall smooth, somewhat blended surface, but still retains the marks of the brush used to apply the initial paint layers in sweeping, roughly horizontal strokes (fig. 3.30). The boats were created using a few economical strokes of fluid paint, which were dragged through the still-somewhat-wet paint of the water in many places (fig. 3.31, fig. 3.32, fig. 3.33). The large steam cloud was mapped out in the upper right corner when the sky and the sea were mostly dry and the steamboat had already been laid in. Afterward, final elements were added to the steamboat, including the white highlights on the smokestacks\u2014which pass over the bottom edge of the steam cloud\u2014and the pole to the left, which was dragged through the wet steam (fig. 3.34). In some areas of the sky and water, it appears that Manet scraped or wiped the paint surface, exposing the ground on the peaks of the canvas weave (fig. 3.35, fig. 3.36).\n\nOnly the large boat on the right side shows signs of minor reworking. Some brushstrokes around the boat and the right edge of the front sail that are visible in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images do not seem to correspond to the final image. The precise nature of any adjustment here is unclear but it could indicate that the boat was initially laid in slightly differently or that the prow originally extended farther to the right (fig. 3.37). A few strokes of dark-brown paint were added along the right edge of the front sail, slightly broadening it. The brown paint was applied when the water was dry (fig. 3.38), and brushstrokes from the steam cloud, which were also dry, continue underneath the edge of the sail, indicating where the sail originally ended (fig. 3.39). In the final stages of painting, the water was brought up around the front edge of the boat while the brown paint was still wet (fig. 3.40, fig. 3.41). This may have been done to clarify the edge of the boat where the changes had been made. In general, this area of the painting is worked up more than other parts and appears relatively dense in the X-ray and transmitted-light images (fig. 3.42). The frothy white wake created by the steamboat was initially painted more broadly, and then partially covered by the blue-green paint of the water, reducing it along the right side (fig. 3.43). The lead white\u2013rich impasto of the foam was already dry when this adjustment was made, possibly as part of the broader reworking of the water around the sailboat.\n\nManet inscribed a border into the wet paint around the edges of the composition (fig. 3.44). In passages where the paint was thinly applied, such as the corners and in the sky, the scraped edge is difficult to discern; however, where the paint was thicker, the implement that Manet used displaced the paint, forming a ridge on one or both sides of the resulting furrow (fig. 3.45). It is difficult to tell what kind of tool was used for this. The width of the scraped area ranges from 5 to 7 mm. In some places it looks like a double-pronged instrument was employed, leaving a ridge of paint roughly down the center (fig. 3.46), but this could also be the result of Manet having used multiple strokes of the implement in areas. In some places, it looks like a very fine line was inscribed just inside the border, but this is very faint and intermittent, and it is unclear whether the line is actually related to the scraped border (fig. 3.47, fig. 3.48). Manet created the border before the painting was stretched, as it exhibits the scalloping introduced by the stretching. The border must have been made when the painting (or at least the sky and the water at the edges) was complete: in only one place, a later stroke of paint was added after the border had been inscribed. This is at the left horizon where the upper horizontal stroke of the water passes over the scraped edge of the border (fig. 3.49, fig. 3.50). The subsequent strokes must have been added when the underlying border was already dry, since the ridges of displaced paint remained undisturbed. The artist apparently applied a few reinforcing strokes along the horizon as final touches to the painting (fig. 3.51).\n\nBrushes, including 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layer.\n\nXRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, iron oxide-containing pigments, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue, and bone black.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThere is a yellowed natural-resin varnish layer that imparts a slightly glossy surface. Older yellowed varnish residues are pooled in the recesses of the paint texture. This may be the result of previous thinning or partial cleaning. It is not known when the varnish layers were applied.\n\nThere is no record of previous treatment. The uneven appearance of the yellowed varnish layer under normal and UV (ultraviolet) light suggests that the painting was partially cleaned at some point.\n\nThe painting is in near-pristine condition. It is unlined and appears to retain its original stretcher and tacking. The stretcher has been keyed out, causing the left and right members to stand 2\u20133 mm proud of the edge. The wood over the key slot on the top right stretcher member has split off, but the key remains securely in place. The tacking edges show general wear and tear, with some splits and fraying at the edges of the fabric where excess was folded over the back edge of the stretcher, and some mild abrasion of the ground, especially at the corners. There are a couple of small bulges in the canvas along the lower edge that appear to be the result of something having been wedged in between the canvas and the stretcher. There are localized areas of wrinkled paint in the water surrounding the right foreground sailboat and on the boat itself. This section appears to have been reworked by the artist, and the wrinkling may be due to the relatively thick layering of paint and the differential drying rates (fig. 3.52). There are two small damages (or possible flaws) in the canvas on the left side of the bottom edge that seem to have resulted in disruptions or openings of the weave. These appear to be of long standing and are secure. There are several tiny clumps visible throughout the surface of the water; some of these are evidently bits of dried paint or other inclusions, while others have the appearance of protrusions, which may be related to soap formation in the paint layers. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layer. A fairly pronounced network of mechanical cracks is evident over most of the surface\u2014this is more intense in the lower right quadrant where the paint layers were more built up. The edges of the cracks are slightly raised, but the paint is secure. There are stretcher-bar cracks over the vertical crossbar and light abrasions and accretions in the frame rebate area. A few tiny accretions can be seen on the surface of the painting in the lower left quadrant. The varnish is yellowed and uneven and appears to have been thinned in the past. The stretcher has been furnished with a panel insert.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1999): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a nineteenth-century French Neoclassical scotia frame with an independent liner with a sanded frieze. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and composition ornament with casein-painted outer edges. The gilding is mostly matte with very soft burnish on the rails and fillet tops. The frame retains its original gilding and glue size. The pine molding is compound and blocked at the corners and centers, and mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines. The outer molding from the perimeter to the interior is fillet, quirked ogee, scotia side, cove, fillet, torus carved to a stack of three reeds, fillet, cove, scotia, fillet, fillet, and fillet with beaded ornament. The liner is fillet, sanded frieze, fillet, and cove at the sight edge (fig. 3.53, fig. 3.54). The frame\u2019s section width is 14 cm (5 1/2 in.).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1967; removed by 1999): The painting was previously housed in a Louis XIV ogee frame with straight sides and foliate corner and center cartouches (fig. 3.55).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933; removed by 1967): The painting was previously housed in a French late nineteenth-century Louis XIV Revival convex frame with deeply cast plaster acanthus-leaf corners and foliate and fleur-de-lis ornament and an independent fillet-and-cove liner. Although this particular frame has been lost, matching frames in the collection have the following finish. The frame is water gilded and oil gilded on a red brown bole over gesso and cast plaster. The sides and frieze are burnished and the ornament is selectively burnished. The molding is compound and blocked on the verso, mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines. The molding from the perimeter to the interior is ovolo with flower-and-dart, scotia-side, convex face with foliate and fleur-de-lis ornament on a crosshatched bed and acanthus-leaf miters, fillet, hollow frieze, ogee with leaf-tip, cove sight, and an independent fillet-and-cove liner (fig. 3.56).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Probably sold by the artist to Louis Gauthier-Lathuille, Paris, 1881, for 1,000 francs.\n\nSold by Louis Gauthier-Lathuille, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Feb. 20, 1900, for 20,000 francs.\n\nTransferred from Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Dec. 1900.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Edward Fullerton Milliken, New York, Dec. 31, 1900, for $10,000.\n\nSold at Edward Fullerton Milliken\u2019s sale, American Art Galleries, New York, Feb. 14, 1902, lot 17, to Knoedler and Co., New York, as an agent for Mrs. Bertha Potter Palmer, for $7,050.\n\nBy descent from Mrs. Bertha Potter Palmer (died 1918), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Stock Durand-Ruel Paris 5699, Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for unknown date\n\nPhoto Durand-Ruel Paris 1489\n\nLetter from M.

While Cachin here is describing The Battle of the USS \u201cKearsarge\u201d and the CSS \u201cAlabama\u201d (1864; fig. 3.5; [RW I 76]), this idea could apply to the Chicago painting equally well.\n\nAuguste Manet, the painter\u2019s father, was a senior official in the Ministry of Justice and wished to see his elder son follow him in his professional career. See Antonin Proust, \u00c9douard Manet: Souvenirs (Henri Laurens, 1913), pp. 1, 5.\n\nManet had failed at his first attempt to pass the entrance exam, in 1848.

Violet M. Macdonald (Constable, 1936), pp. 150\u201351.\n\n\u00c9mile Zola, who had met Manet in 1866, was the first to point out the importance of the Rio trip in his decision to become a painter: \u201cSo, of course, at the age of seventeen, \u00c9douard Manet was embarked as a cadet on a ship bound for Rio de Janeiro. Undoubtedly, the Scarlet Woman, that Courtesan, always hungry for fresh blood [here painting], embarked with him, and surrounded by the clear, empty vastness of sky and ocean, succeeded in seducing him. She appealed to his flesh, she dangled before his eyes sparkling horizons and spoke to him of passion, in the sweet and compelling language of colour. On his return, Manet was given up entirely to Infamy.\u201d See \u00c9mile Zola, \u201cUne nouvelle mani\u00e8re en peinture: \u00c9douard Manet,\u201d L\u2019Artiste: Revue du XIX<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle: Les lettres, les arts, la philosophie, romans et voyages, t. 4, Jan. 1, 1867, p. 45, translated in Theresa A.

Gronberg, Manet: A Retrospective (Hugh Lauter Levin, 1988), p. 47. Manet\u2019s fondness for the sea, seascapes, and open air allowed him to see things \u201cwith a simplicity which Couture did not understand,\u201d and this may have been one of the stumbling blocks that set master and pupil at odds. Thomas Couture did not like the sea, as is recounted by the novelist Alphonse Karr: \u201cLast summer, I [Karr] met on the beach at Sainte-Adresse a fairly disheveled young man who, sitting on a large stone, his eyes fixed on the sea, from time to time added a brushstroke to a canvas that he had on his knees: as I approached, he gripped the canvas, raised it, and said: \u2018I\u2019m leaving. . . . I definitely do not like the sea . . . \u2019\u201d; see Jean Rousseau, \u201cChronique des Arts,\u201d L\u2019univers illustr\u00e9, 9e ann\u00e9e, no. 586, Nov. 3, 1866, p. 702: \u201cL\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9 dernier, . . . je rencontrai sur la plage de Sainte-Adresse\u2014un jeune homme assez \u00e9bouriff\u00e9 qui, assis sur une grosse pierre, les yeux fix\u00e9s sur la mer, donnait de temps en temps un coup de pinceau \u00e0 une toile qu\u2019il avait sur les genoux;\u2014 comme j\u2019approchai, il serra la toile,\u2014se leva\u2014et dit: \u2018Je m\u2019en vais . . . d\u00e9cid\u00e9ment la mer ne me pla\u00eet pas . . . .\u2019\u201d\n\nIt does not seem that Manet painted during his voyage to Rio; however, he brought back with him \u201cimpressions\u201d that would fuel his later work.\n\nAccording to the weekly L\u2019europe artiste (Jan. 3, 1864) in July and August the population of Boulogne-sur-Mer was annually boosted by 20,000 visitors from abroad.\n\nOn Manet\u2019s stays in Boulogne, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau and David Degener, \u201cManet and the Sea,\u201d in Juliet Wilson-Bareau and David Degener, Manet and the Sea, with contributions by Lloyd DeWitt et al., exh. cat.

These letters reveal that Manet had visited both towns for restorative treatments. Furthermore, in an undated letter the sculptor and poet Zacharie Astruc, a dedicated hispanophile and close friend of Manet, informed the painter of \u201can admirable source (situated in Spain) to cure the sickness that you have.\u201d Astruc added: \u201cinstead of parading around Boulogne, to no avail, you would do better to go heal on the Cantabrian coast.\u201d \u201cune source admirable [situ\u00e9e en Espagne] pour gu\u00e9rir le mal que vous avez . . . au lieu d\u2019aller faire le beau \u00e0 Boulogne, en pure perte, vous ferez mieux d\u2019aller vous gu\u00e9rir sur le c\u00f4te cantabrique.\u201d (Copy made by L\u00e9on Leenhoff from letters received by \u00c9douard Manet, private collection; translation by Genevieve Westerby and Charline Fournier-Petit.)

(Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/Abrams, 1994), p. 235. For Hiroshige as a possible source, see John Leighton, Edouard Manet: Impressions of the Sea, exh. cat. (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Mercatorfonds, 2004).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV (ultraviolet), etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis indicates that the signature contains viridian and lead white. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_Boat\\_22\\_425\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 10, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe canvas fibers were not analyzed.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The small discrepancy between the current dimensions and those of the standard size is probably a result of keying out of the stretcher.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: \u00c9douard Manet Steamboat Leaving Boulogne (RW78/1922.425),\u201d Oct. 2012.\n\nThe pins appear to have been placed by eye, and the holes are not precisely spaced out. Similar pinholes and evidence that the works were painted before being mounted on their stretchers were observed on Manet\u2019s Fish (Still Life) (cat. 2) and Portrait of a Woman with a Black Fichu (cat. 16).\n\nIron was confirmed by XRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_Boat\\_22\\_425\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 10, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis probably indicates that the cusping on the left, right, and top edges is secondary cusping (related to the mounting of the canvas on the present stretcher), while the more pronounced cusping on the bottom edge is probably primary cusping (related to the initial stretching of the larger canvas during the commercial priming process) (see Ground Application/Texture).\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer could not be confirmed by cross-sectional analysis.\n\nA fairly continuous hand-drawn line is visible along the top and right edges, close to the cut edge of the primed fabric. The purpose is unclear, but one possible suggestion is that the lines were used to indicate where the canvas was to be cut from the larger roll.\n\nThe brushmarks do not always seem to extend to the very edge of the priming on the bottom tacking margin.\n\nThe brushmarks are only very faintly visible in the X-ray under magnification.\n\nThe ground was analyzed using SEM/EDX (scanning electron miscroscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and XRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy). Some dark-brown and black particles were observed in the cross sections and when the surface of the painting was examined microscopically, and traces of iron were detected in XRF spectra collected from the ground layer, which could be an indication of the presence of trace amounts of iron-oxide pigments. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_SteamboatBoulogne\\_1922\\_425\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d July 2, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_Boat\\_22\\_425\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 11, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA similar treatment of the edges was observed in Manet\u2019s Woman Reading [cat. 19] and Fish (Still Life) [cat. 2], and was also documented in his Asparagus (1880; [RW I 357], in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud). It was suggested in the latter example that the purpose may have been to \u201ctest the effect of the composition or to suggest a pale frame.\u201d See Iris Schaefer, \u201cEdouard Manet\u2014Still Life with Asparagus: Brief Report on Technology and Condition,\u201d in Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpressionism (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, 2008), http://www.museenkoeln.de/impressionismus/03\\_abbzoom.asp?lang=&amp;pg=&amp;typ=kuenstler&amp;val=11&amp;iid=18.\n\nThe inside dimensions of the border are approximately 91\u201391.5 \u00d7 71.5\u201372 cm, but this is difficult to measure accurately because of the cusping. These dimensions are slightly smaller than the standard no. 30 stretcher (73 \u00d7 92 cm).\n\nXRF (X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy) analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_Boat\\_22\\_425\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 11, 2012, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination as well as knowledge of Manet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Manet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 74.\n\nManet made a record of this sale, which survives as a transcript made by Leon Leenhoff; see L\u00e9on Leenhoff, Manet: Ensemble de notes et de documents sur le peintre, c. 1910. Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Estampes et photographie, RESERVE 8-YB3-2401, p. 80. Manet notes the sale of two works to Louis Gauthier-Lathuille: \u201cLathuile [sic] Marine 1000F/ Olorou 200F.\u201d A Parisian restaurateur, Gauthier-Lathuille was immortalized by Manet in his 1880 Salon submission Chez le P\u00e8re Lathuille (1879; Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-arts de Tournai [RW I 291]). This sale by Manet overturns a previously published provenance for this work, which suggested that this picture may have been no. 81 in the 1884 Manet estate sale and was at one time owned by Leon Clapisson; see Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett, Juliet Wilson-Bareau, and Michel S. Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat.
