    "description": "Shrouded in snow, the pristine locales of Utagawa Hiroshige\u2019s Japan are untouched by modern life. Hiroshige, a member of the samurai class, inherited his father\u2019s official post as a teenager, though he simultaneously apprenticed as an ukiyo-e artist. He maintained this arrangement for close to two decades, only retiring from his official position in the years following the death of his artistic master. It was around this time that he began creating landscapes, the woodblock prints that would make him and his work beloved around the world. The prints showcased in this holiday card assortment present Hiroshige\u2019s vision of the idyllic, tranquil Japanese winter.
