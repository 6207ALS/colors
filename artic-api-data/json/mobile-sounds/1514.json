    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is a great example of what's called, &quot;Trompe-l'oeil,&quot; which is French for, &quot;Fool the eye.&quot; These types of paintings were often seen in taverns and stores, as well as art galleries. This one was painted by William Harnett.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: Harnett is really the most famous American painter painting in that style in the late 19th century, some people would say the best one.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: It's an interesting choice of motifs though, to paint in the trompe-l'oeil style. In this case I think there is an element of humor going on. Also there's an element of nostalgia, because Harnett's patrons at the time would have been in the city, he was painting for relatively wealthy people. But this subject is referring to a kind of country dinner, and the door itself is so old and decrepit it's kind of referring back to an idyllic country past. People really longed for that. One reading of this painting is the lock over there on the left, and it's slipping down, so you see behind it the unpainted door. He's kind of making a connection between that lock and the chicken itself, which has also been stripped of all of its covering, and you see its ugly flesh.</p>\n",
