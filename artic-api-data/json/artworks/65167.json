    "description": "<p>This tapestry dramatizes a battle fought in 334 B.C. between the Macedonians and the Persians. Alexander the great, king of the Macedonians, is depicted just left of center; dressed in ornate gilt armor, he rides a white horse and raises a sword boldly above his head. Facing him is a Persian general on a dark horse with both hands grasped around an axe. Although Alexander appears imperiled, he was ultimately victorious in the battle. the tense moment represented here provided a compelling narrative for noble patrons in the 17th century, willing to imagine Alexander's triumphs as equivalent to their own.</p>\n",
