    "short_description": "<p>Beginning in the early 1970s, a handful of British and American photo-driven alternative magazines came on the scene. <em>The Face</em>,&nbsp;<em>i-D</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rags,</em>&nbsp;<em>Out/Look</em>, and other new publications amplified marginalized voices, especially those of queer makers and makers of color, and made room for those makers to question who and what was accepted as mainstream. This exhibition brings together over 130 magazines as well as photographs and time-based media works that evidence how these publications challenged mainstream definitions of culture and belonging.</p>",
