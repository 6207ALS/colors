    "description": "<p>Anne Appleby visually distills the natural world. Her landscapes\u2014reductive, delicately-layered, almost monochrome canvases\u2014and intricately rendered figurative images are the result of extended considerations of her surroundings in rural Montana. She notes the life cycles of the varied flora, the shifts in weather and atmospheric conditions, and the changing of the seasons, letting her observations activate subtly dynamic paintings that confront humanity\u2019s complex relationship with nature and exude a deep sense of spirit.</p><p>Join Appleby and abstract artist Caroline Kent for a discussion of her extraordinary practice.</p><h2>About the Speakers</h2><p><em>This public program is made possible with the support of PRADA.</em></p>",
