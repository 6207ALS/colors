Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nGauguin left no instructions as to how to display the prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after his death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \"House of Pleasure\" in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nWhen put end to end, Change of Residence and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love and You Will Be Happy) seem like a continuous image in which figures and animals stand in an undulating, horizontal landscape accented with trees (see fig. 104.1). Both compositions are divided into two zones by the horizon line. In the case of Change of Residence, the area below the line contains three women whose hands form the mudra position namaskara, a gesture of greeting and adoration. Also in this section are a horse and rider and several animals. Just above the line at the right, a dog acts as a transition from the earthly to the spiritual. Above that, a figure, with one arm raised, observes the activity below. The figure is juxtaposed with an intricate arabesque embellished with foliage, animal forms, and the word \u201cTahiti.\u201d The lower section of Soyez amoureuses features a dog and three full-length figures. Above, beginning at the upper left, are two large, almost disembodied heads and to the right two smaller figures seen from the chest up. Echoing the circular form in Change of Residence is a cartouche containing the artist\u2019s initials. The print\u2019s title is incorporated into a banderole, a compositional device from medieval art favored by Gauguin (see, for example, cat. 25, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). The banderole\u2019s curves echo the horizon line in the opposite scene.\n\nThe imagery of this pair of wood-block prints derives from a panoply of motifs and themes that had preoccupied Gauguin from the late 1880s on. The artist drew upon a wide range of sources, including his exploration in the mid- to late 1880s of the rich holdings of Paris\u2019s museums, most notably those of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro. The artist recorded some of these experiences in the sketchbook referred to as the Album Walter (see fig. 104.28, fig. 104.32, fig. 104.37, and fig. 104.57 below). Dating from the mid- to late 1880s, the sketchbook accompanied Gauguin on his second trip to Polynesia.\n\nThe sources for this two-part, printed frieze are predominately religious in origin, both Judeo-Christian and Buddhist. Gauguin quoted from Renaissance paintings in the Louvre as well as incorporated details of reliefs from the temple complex of Borobudur, Central Java, Indonesia, of which the artist owned two photographs by Isidore van Kinsbergen (see fig. 104.2). He freely combined elements of various religions, including as well quotations of secular life. For example, in the contemporary painting The Great Buddha (fig. 104.50 [W 579]), he mixed Judeo-Christian images with references to secular art forms from Maori/New Zealand culture and bestowed on the whole a title related to Buddhism.\n\nFor these prints, the artist also drew from his early work as well the most recent, and at least one event in his own life: The birth of his son \u00c9mile prompted him to include an image of the baby in Soyez amoureuses (see fig. 105.52 below).\n\nExamining Change of Residence from left to right and from bottom to top, one begins to trace the imagery\u2019s many sources with the three women at the left, based on the three monks in the upper register of the relief photographed by Van Kinsbergen (fig. 104.2), where they are protagonists in the story Buddha Meeting Three Monks [?] on the Road to Benares (see fig. 104.3). Squeezed in between the figure farthest to the right and the edge of the sheet is a Java mouse deer, its prototype found in the right corner of the Buddhist relief\u2019s upper register (see fig. 104.4 and fig. 104.5). The palm trees and small, unidentifiable trees at the upper left are derived from vegetation in the upper portion of the same ancient Buddhist relief (see fig. 104.6). From the lower register, which relates the tale Maitrakanyaka Arriving in a New Town, Welcomed by Sixteen Nymphs, Gauguin borrowed the image of a mongoose ingesting a reptile (seen at the lower right in Van Kinsbergen\u2019s photograph; see fig. 104.7 and fig. 104.8). The shape of the print\u2019s pale ocher and white flowers derives from the relief\u2019s small, as yet unidentified trees (fig. 104.9).\n\nThe Tahitian woman on horseback is informed by the same subject in Gauguin\u2019s 1899 oil painting Te tiai na oe ite rata (Are You Waiting for a Letter?) (fig. 104.10 [W 587] and fig. 104.11). The figure floating above the equestrian can be identified with the Archangel Jophiel, who ordered Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden. This hovering figure can be found a number of times in the artist\u2019s oeuvre. It first appears in the top-right corner of Gauguin\u2019s 1889 polychrome woodcarving Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (Be in Love and You Will Be Happy) (fig. 104.12 [Gray 76]; see fig. 104.13), followed by the 1890 painting Paradise Lost atop a cloud (fig. 104.14 [W 390]; see fig. 104.13). After finishing Change of Residence, Gauguin made three additional works on the theme of the expulsion from Paradise featuring the Archangel Jophiel (fig. 104.15 [W 628], fig. 104.16 [Field 1973 45], and fig. 104.17; see fig. 104.13).\n\nThe arabesque design combining interlaced foliage, birds, rodents, and the word \u201cTahiti\u201d was inspired by an equally complex motif in the aforementioned Borobudur frieze (see fig. 104.18, where one finds a black-backed swamphen (see fig. 104.19), a lesser bird of paradise (see fig. 104.20), flowers, and mongoose-like rodents. For the dog at the right, Gauguin copied the canine in his 1896 canvas Scene from Tahitian Life (fig. 104.21 [W 537], see fig. 104.22). Also derived from the same Van Kinsbergen photograph are the rodent and bird in the lower right-hand corner (see fig. 104.23). Gauguin\u2019s intention that Change of Residence and Soyez amoureuses be understood as a printed frieze is underscored by the formal way in which he inscribed his name in Change of Residence within a simple, oval frame: Paul Gauguin / fecit.\n\nFinally, Gauguin reprised the entire composition in three traced and transferred monotypes in 1902 and 1903 (fig. 104.24 [Field 1973 95], fig. 104.25 [Field 1973 58], and fig. 104.26 [Field 1973 116]).\n\nTo identify the sources of Soyez amoureuses, the print is examined from left to right and from top to bottom. Set against a circular black form, the disembodied head, its eyes closed, at the upper left derives from one of the two thieves crucified alongside Christ in Andrea Mantegna\u2019s 1456\u201359 Crucifixion (fig. 104.27) in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. A sketch of this detail, made on one of Gauguin\u2019s forays to the museum, appears in the Album Walter (fig. 104.28; see fig. 104.29). A similar head is found in one of the redwood panels that Gauguin carved, painted, and titled Soyez myst\u00e9rieuses (Be Mysterious) in 1902 as decoration for the exterior of Gauguin\u2019s \u201cHouse of Pleasure\u201d (fig. 104.30 [Gray 132]).\n\nFor the adjacent head, Gauguin turned to Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s 1822 Barque of Dante (fig. 104.31), quoting the nude woman partially submerged in the water at the right who clings desperately to the vessel\u2019s railing. Gauguin recorded this fragment in the Album Walter (fig. 104.32; see fig. 104.33). He later inserted the motif into an entirely different, happier context\u2014including a flower at her ear\u2014in yet another carved and painted redwood panel for the House of Pleasure that he called Soyez amoureuses et vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (fig. 104.34 [Gray 132]). Gauguin\u2019s frequent use of the same title, such as Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses, for a variety of works in a number of media does not always indicate that he was working with similar subject matter. A case in point is a watercolor, done around 1894 (fig. 104.35), shaped like a shade (abat-jour) and featuring \u201csoyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses\u201d inscribed across the top. Including a seminude Tahitian woman in a mountainous landscape with a plaited flower basket at the upper right, the watercolor bears no relationship to the figures and motifs of the print under discussion here.\n\nFor the mourning female wearing a headdress and kerchief and clasping her hands in anguish in the top center of the woodblock print, Gauguin again turned to the art of Delacroix, this time to the head of a woman at the top center of the group surrounding Christ in The Lamentation of 1857 (fig. 104.36). His sketch of Delacroix\u2019s mourning woman appears as well in the Album Walter (fig. 104.37). He had already used the same source for a figure in his 1888 painting Arl\u00e9siennes (Mistral) (fig. 104.38 [W 300, W 2002 329]; see fig. 104.39). The head of the mourning woman occurs again in an 1899 headpiece for Gauguin\u2019s short-lived satirical rag Le sourire (The Smile) (fig. 104.40 [Kornfeld 58]) and again in the above-mentioned carved panel for the House of Pleasure (fig. 104.41).\n\nGauguin derived the final figure in this quartet from that of Saint John in Andrea Solario\u2019s 1503 Crucifixion (fig. 104.42), also in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, in which the apostle kneels behind Mary, comforting the mother of Jesus with his right hand on her left shoulder while the Magdalen supports her. A sketch of this particular detail is found in the Album Walter (fig. 104.37, fig. 104.43). Saint John\u2019s head appears in the above-mentioned masthead for Le sourire (fig. 104.40), as well as in the painted and carved redwood panel for the House of Pleasure (fig. 104.34 and fig. 104.44).\n\nExtending from the right edge to roughly two-thirds of the way across the composition is a wall of tightly plaited leaves lashed to bamboo posts that serves as a backdrop for the three middle figures as well as the top register\u2019s fifth element, a bird. Similar avians can be found at the far left bottom corner of two oil compositions Gauguin had executed in 1897: Vairumati (fig. 104.45 [W 59]) and the monumental D\u2019o\u00f9 venons nous, Que sommes nous, O\u00f9 allons nous (Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?) (fig. 104.46 [W 561]; see fig. 104.47). The same bird features in the center of another print in the suite to which the two works under discussion here belong\u2014Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil\u2014in which the bird has captured a lizard (fig. 104.48 [Kornfeld 48]]).\n\nIn contrast to the four heads in the top register, which reference events related in the New Testament and in Dante\u2019s Inferno, the motifs decorating the cartouche and the forms emanating from it to the right derive from designs incorporating birds and rodents found in the Van Kinsbergen photographs of Buddhist reliefs of Borobudur (see fig. 104.49). Below and to the right of the cartouche is a dog and suckling puppies. A similar group is found in the lower right corner of the 1899 painting The Great Buddha (fig. 104.50 [W 579]; see fig. 104.51).\n\nA unique figure in the context of the visual sources inserted into this cornucopia of religious and literary references is a baby (fig. 104.52)\u2014the son of Gauguin and his mistress, Pahura, who was born on April 19, 1899, and named \u00c9mile Marea a Tai Gauguin (he died in 1980). Throughout his career, Gauguin portrayed children, his own as well as others, with insight and affection (see fig. 104.53, fig. 104.54).\n\nAs mentioned above, Gauguin explored the ethnographic collections in the Mus\u00e9e du Trocad\u00e9ro. Among the items he sketched in the Album Walter is a mummy found in the North Andes (see fig. 104.55, fig. 104.56, and fig. 104.57). The huddled figure with arms supporting its head to the right of \u00c9mile is based on these sketches (see fig. 104.58). The Peruvian mummy informed the anguished poses of figures in a number of works from the late 1880s dealing with the theme of life and death, in a variety of mediums, including oil, pastel, and pen and ink (see fig. 104.46, fig. 104.59 [W 333], fig. 104.60 [W 335], and fig. 104.61).\n\nThe seated nude at the far right, her arms raised and hands clasped in prayer, was influenced very likely by a photographic reproduction Gauguin obtained of a large, late-fifteenth-century tapestry in the Cathedral of Saint-Maurice in Angers. Below the three crosses are the three Marys, including, at the right, the figure of the elegantly dressed and caped Magdalen, which served as the model for the nude in the print (fig. 104.62 and fig. 104.63).\n\nToward the end of his life, after completing his 1902 manuscript L\u2019esprit moderne et la catholicisme (Catholicism and the Modern Mind), in which he contemplated the meaning of religion in contemporary life, Gauguin pasted a black-and-ocher impression of Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses on the inside front cover of the manuscript (fig. 104.64).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.
