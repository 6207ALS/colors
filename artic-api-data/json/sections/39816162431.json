Marcel Gu\u00e9rin attributed the work to S\u00e9guin based on a proof with his signature on it. Caroline Boyle-Turner's alternate suggestion that the circumstances favor an attribution to Gauguin, with the cooperation of S\u00e9guin, was confirmed in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin's prints.\n\nAs indicated by the inscription Chez Seguin \u00e0 St. Julien in the plate, the work was produced in S\u00e9guin\u2019s printmaking studio in the St. Julien quarter of Pont-Aven. As noted in the catalogue raionn\u00e9, the two artists met in Pont-Aven in April 1894, and Gauguin visited S\u00e9guin there in late spring. Much later, the printer Eug\u00e8ne Del\u00e2tre wrote in a letter of April 6, 1938, that Gauguin drew the entire image in the presence of fellow artist Roderic O\u2019Conor on a plate that S\u00e9guin had grounded and etched. Only a few proofs seem to have been pulled. Although the etched plate remained in S\u00e9guin\u2019s possession until 1899, the print was not among the seventy-six prints exhibited in S\u00e9guin\u2019s only one-man show in February 1895.\n\nThe image shows a rather stiff young woman seated before some figs and a bowl laid out on a decorative mat before a landscape including an enormous hillock capped by a house surrounded by trees and set against a tranquil sailboat on a calm sea. Just behind the suggestion of the house, one can discern the remnants of a portrait of a man. Boyle-Turner suggested this figure might have been intended to add a threatening note similar to the painting Arl\u00e9siennes (Mistral) in the Art Institute of Chicago (cat. 10).\n\nBoyle-Turner further noted that the work\u2019s compositional complexity is more typical of Gauguin than of S\u00e9guin, and compared the woman\u2019s face to Madeleine Bernard, \u00c9mile Bernard\u2019s sister, likely the subject of the 1889 painting Young Breton Woman (fig. 76.2 [W 316]). Apparently both Gauguin and his traveling companion, Charles Laval, were attracted to Madeleine; Laval won out, but both Laval and his bride were dead by November 1895.\n\nOne distinctive attribute links this work to Gauguin, and that is the peculiar hand gesture. Emerging from behind an enormous table, one of the \u201cstrange, caliper-like hands\u201d is crooked in a gesture that was first identified as related to Hindu and Buddhist iconography by Naomi Maurer. This is not quite the bent figure gesture that Henri Dorra identifies as inspired by Javanese and Khmer art, seen in The Spinner (Joan of Arc) (1889; (fig. 76.3 [W 329]) or the Female Nude with Sunflowers (1889; private collection [W 330]).\n\nIn 1899, Julius Meier-Graefe sought out the image for his portfolio Germinal, acquiring the plate from S\u00e9guin after he had cleaned and retouched it. Del\u00e2tre pulled one hundred impressions for the publication, and the plate remained with his family, passing to another French collection only in 1962. The fact that the print was published without dispute as by Gauguin during the artists\u2019 lifetimes speaks for the accuracy of its attribution to Gauguin.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Gerald Cramer (1916\u20131991), Geneva, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1951.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture, Feb. 12\u2013Mar. 29, 1959, cat. 126; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Apr. 21\u2013May 31, 1959.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Institute of Chicago and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture, exh. cat.
