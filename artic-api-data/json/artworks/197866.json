    "description": "<p>This remarkable study of dignified old age is a poignant, rare portrait of Jean-Baptiste Greuze\u2019s mother, Claudine, made when she was approximately 75 years old. Recently discovered, it documents a tender reunion of mother and son. Greuze visited his family in Tournus in 1755 on his way to Italy with Abbot Gougenot. A related drawing in a private Parisian collection has been identified as <em>Madame Greuze Embracing Her Son after 20 Years Absence</em>; the date of that work suggests that the present sheet was also made in 1775.</p>\n",
