    "description": "<p>During World War I, commercial photographer Arthur Mole partnered with John Thomas to make a series of &quot;living photographs,&quot; arranging thousands of soldiers into designs that created optical illusions of patriotic themes such as the American flag, a profile of Woodrow Wilson, and the Statue of Liberty. Completing these massive spectacles required a week or more of preparation. Mole and Thomas spent hours positioning the troops and constructed an enormous tower from which to photograph the arrangement. The &quot;top&quot; of these creations could be as far as a quarter mile from the camera, and the final composition only made sense from the camera's pseudo-aerial point of view. To make <em>The Human Liberty Bell</em>, the photographers employed 25,000 military personnel at Camp Dix, New Jersey, a training ground for the 78th Division of the National Army. The composition made each posing soldier into a piece of the patriotic message.</p>\n",
