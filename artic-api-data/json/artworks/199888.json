    "description": "<p>Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz arrived in Paris from his native Hungary in 1925 knowing almost no one. Within a few years, he had developed a circle of artist friends, forged contacts with magazine editors who would publish his photographs, and earned budding acceptance for his newly honed vision. In early 1926 Kert\u00e9sz was invited to photograph Piet Mondrian\u2019s home and studio, and was impressed by the formal rigor of the famous abstract painter. Later that year, the violinist Feri R\u00f3th asked him to make some publicity photographs of his new quartet, and he made five photographs, including this one. Influenced by Mondrian, Kert\u00e9sz radically cropped this image to suggest an orthogonal geometric composition centering around the sheet music; he then printed it on postcard stock, one of his preferred presentation styles in the 1920s.</p>\n",
