    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>The entrance to the exhibition is framed by two columns wrapped with a white-to-red gradient vinyl with the artist\u2019s name running from top to bottom. The column on the left reads \u201cBARBARA\u201d and the right column reads \u201cKRUGER.\u201d Both feature white type set against a red gradient background. Between the columns and 30 feet further into the Narthex gallery is an 11-foot-tall freestanding LED wall. It plays a video that features a gray hand holding a red placard with white text that reads, I SHOP therefore I AM. The other three sides of this freestanding wall are wrapped in printed vinyl wallpaper. The narrow left side of the wall reads \u201cNEED IT,\u201d and the narrow right side reads, \u201cWANT IT,\u201d both in white, vertical text running top to bottom against a white-to-red gradient background. The reverse side of the wall repeats the image of the gray hand, this time holding a placard covered in a grid of images found online of people wearing Kruger style T-shirts. The same gray hand repeats along the length of the Narthex walls, three times on both sides of the long, narrow arcade that leads to the main galleries of the exhibition. The six hands hold placards featuring Google-sourced images that resemble the artist\u2019s style but are not her own works.</p>\n",
