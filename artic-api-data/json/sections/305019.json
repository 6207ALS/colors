Here he selected his vantage point with care, and the composition is less casual than it first appears. His meticulous placement of the butterfly monogram, for example, was calculated both to anchor the succession of accents leading back to the dome and to establish the breadth of the terrace.\n\nWhistler used the stump to suggest the cloud formations in the sky, the shadows within the balustrade, the foliage in the middle distance, and a hint of texture in the gravel pathway in the foreground. Drawing more heavily with the stump, Whistler also added the dark accent on the far right and the foliage of the trees that frame the dome of the Pantheon. There are minor differences from one impression to another, particularly in the cloud formations in the sky. This is to be expected with the printing of such delicate areas of stumping, and is the result of different inkings or slight wear rather than any intentional changes to the stone.\n\nAt least twenty-six impressions of this image were printed by Thomas Way during Whistler\u2019s lifetime, although T. R. Way cited only fifteen in his 1905 catalogue.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (324 \u00d7 220 mm), signed.
