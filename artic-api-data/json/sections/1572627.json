The evolution of the painting was long and complex. Matisse worked on it intermittently for at least eight years, layering painted revisions one on top of another. At each stage, Matisse retained and incorporated parts from the existing composition, particularly sections of the figures, but he made major changes to the general posture and construction of the figures, the background, and the color palette. Six stages of revisions have been identified by historical photographs, eyewitness accounts, stereomicroscopic examination, cross sections of the many paint layers, and technical imaging. In particular, the X-ray of the painting, adjusted to suppress the density of the stretcher bars and the thickest vertical bands, and the transmitted-infrared image were instrumental in revealing the different positions of the figures. Several of the six stages seem to present a fully realized painting, such as the state photographed by Eug\u00e8ne Druet at Matisse\u2019s request in November 1913. But other identified states may simply be points along the way, when Matisse was in the process of developing the painting further.\n\nThe first state (March\u2013May 1909) includes the planning and first rendition of the painting. There is no evidence of a charcoal sketch; Matisse laid out the composition with black painted sketch lines. The palette was brighter than in later revisions and featured a bright yellow-green for the background, pink with turquoise and dark-blue variations for the waterfall, and dark blue for the sky. The four relatively flat pink figures were outlined in red, and a yellow-green snake projected up from the bottom center. The fourth figure was holding a blue-green cloth in front of her body, and the first figure may have been slipping a blue-green shirt over her head. Both figures were more animated and natural in pose, with raised arms and twisting torsos. The third figure\u2019s legs were immersed in the river, surrounded by dark-blue wavelets.\n\nThe second state (fall 1909\u2013spring 1910) encompassed a few compositional changes, such as moving the second figure up and back in the pictorial space and painting over its previous position with black. Changes to the palette include a darker green for the background.\n\nA third state was documented in photographs taken by Alvin Langdon Coburn on May 13, 1913, that reveal bold compositional changes, including scraping out areas of the figures and reshaping forms to be more abstract. He also began to add thin pale-gray scumbles to the pink figures.\n\nA photograph taken by Druet at Matisse\u2019s request in early November 1913 exhibits a fully realized fourth state. The entire background was painted over with shades of gray, applied expressionistically in multiple layers, to which Matisse added black scalloped contours for foliage and other black lines for grass and rippling water. An external framework of vertical black lines incorporated elements of the landscape within the outer edges of the figures, and Matisse made bathers the more abstract still, by adding overriding large curves, straight lines, and sharp angles to the figures\u2019 contours. Individualized features were eliminated.\n\nA Galerie Bernheim Jeune photograph documents the end of a fifth state (early spring\u2013November 1916), at which point the painting was close to the final version. The four figures were further encased in gray and white scumbles and black outlines. Within the figures, black contour lines were added to articulate the parts of the body and further strengthen their structure. He also added solid oval shapes for the heads of the standing figures and a rectangular pictograph over part of the seated figure\u2019s head. In the background he distilled earlier narrative details: the three pairs of curved lines that appear in descending order from the right edge of the composition toward the center signify the waterfall, while the previous central pink waterfall had become first a pink vertical band, then a blue one, and finally a black band. Matisse simplified the entire background into wide vertical bands of solid colors. During this stage he also engaged in a major scraping campaign to remove paint between the left edge of the painting and the first figure. He then incised and scraped leaf shapes through six previous layers of black, white, blue-green, and gray to arrive at the still earlier greens. The green leaves with variegated colored patches and edges reveal this layering and enliven the painting\u2019s edge.\n\nIn the sixth state worked sometime between the 1916 photograph and one by Paul Guillaume in 1926, Matisse changed the color of one last background band and enlarged and reshaped a few of the leaves at the left edge with additional scraping, to arrive at the final state of the painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 25.1t).\n\nSigned: Henri \u2013 Matisse (bottom edge near left corner, in black paint) (fig. 25.2t). There are losses scattered within the signature, particularly in the ri of Henri and the at of Matisse (fig. 25.3t).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions of the painting (260 \u00d7 392 cm) are larger than standard-size canvases. The painting is twice as large as a no. 120 portrait (figure) (130 \u00d7 195 cm) canvas, the largest size commonly available.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 11.5 (0.6) \u00d7 17.5 (0.3) threads/cm. Standard deviation calculations indicate that the vertical threads correspond to the warp and the horizontal ones to the weft.\n\nThe canvas is a good quality, medium-weight linen composed of relatively thick threads. The side edges would have been the selvage edges. The vertical thread-angle map shows deeper primary cusping on the right edge. This observation suggests that about 10\u201315 cm was trimmed or wrapped around the stretcher on the left edge. Thus, the loom size was greater than the width of the painting, or more than 4 m wide.\n\nCurrent stretching: Follows original foldover lines as closely as feasible (see Conservation History). The top edge does not dip toward the middle quite as much as it did originally and the format is not quite as off-square as the original. As a result, the stretcher is slightly larger than the original on the left toward the top and on the right toward the bottom.\n\nOriginal stretching: The long stretcher bars sagged toward the middle. The stretcher was somewhat off-square. The canvas was not stretched square to the edges of the ground application or to the weave.\n\nCurrent stretcher: An ICA spring stretcher replaced the previous stretcher in 1968, when the painting was lined (see Conservation History). In the 2007 treatment, these stretcher bars were modified to follow the curve of the original stretching (see Stretching) and were fixed in place.\n\nOriginal stretcher: The previous stretcher was on the painting when it entered the museum collection in 1953. It had two crossbars in each direction. It was possibly original. The width of the original stretcher bars was 10.5 cm. Only one label, from 1950, was noted (see Labels and Inscriptions). Matisse took the painting off its stretcher and stored it rolled at least twice, and it may subsequently have been rolled for storage or transport (see curatorial essay). A new stretcher might well have been used at some point when it was restretched.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe canvas was pre-primed (fig. 25.4t). The canvas exhibits cusping beyond the ground application, but the edges of the ground are straight, indicating the canvas was stretched when the ground was applied, probably on a larger commercial priming strainer. The ground extends onto the side edges beyond the painted surface. On the right side the ground extends 7 cm beyond the original tacking edge. The ground consists of a single layer of moderate thickness ranging from approximately 20 to 150 \u03bcm.\n\nWhite.\n\nFTIR analysis indicates that the ground contains lead white (basic and neutral lead carbonates) in an oil binder. SEM/EDX and XRF analysis identified fairly pure lead white, without fillers or traces of colored pigment particles.\n\nNo underdrawing was detected. Matisse used black painted sketch lines to set the initial composition, but in the first and second states these lines were reinforced with vermilion-red contours. In two cases, when Matisse sketched in changes over an area he had painted out with black, he skipped the black sketch and instead used vermilion or pale pink over the black area to sketch the change.\n\nA photograph from the Henri Matisse Archive taken around March 25, 1909, shows the artist in front of the left side of the painting during the early painted sketch phase (see fig. 25.5t). The sketch lines for the two bathers at left are faintly visible on either side of him. On the right, what seems to be the second bather\u2019s bent knees (to the right of Matisse\u2019s palette) and lowered head in profile with hair in a chignon (next to Matisse\u2019s head) are visible. Darkly painted areas are also seen at the forms\u2019 edges, used to adjust and set off the shapes. Matisse used such dark areas around the contour lines during the painted sketch stage of Music (1910; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), as photographed by Druet in the fall of 1909 (fig. 25.6t). On the left side of the Matisse Archive photograph of Bathers, the planar perspective drawing of a foot with lower leg for the first bather is clearly shown (fig. 25.7t). He projected imaginary sculptural lines for the foot as if the form was transparent, with lines constructing the edge of each plane, rather than describing the foot\u2019s pictorial contours.\n\nOn the painting, initial sketch lines in black paint were detected for most of the figures\u2019 contours. Cross sections show that there is a black sketch layer directly on the ground under most of the subsequent orange-red layers of the contour lines of the first state. For example, in the first state the fourth bather held her proper left arm closer to her body, as shown in transmitted infrared (fig. 25.8t). The orange-red contour line for this original arm is still visible on the painting through the final gray scumble layer (fig. 25.9t). A cross section of this orange line shows the black sketch line underneath (fig. 25.10t). In the third state Matisse used light-pink lines to establish this figure\u2019s lower legs over a blacked-out area, which in the first state was a pool of water in which the figure was standing. The pink lines over black remain partially visible on the finished work, although Matisse scraped and scumbled over them (fig. 25.11t).\n\nMatisse not only used orange-red lines as early sketch lines, but also, in the first and second states, to reinforce the bathers\u2019 final contours. Remnants of the final red contour lines from these early states are often visible in the finished painting as flashes of bright orange\u2014for example, the brushstrokes indicating the original crossed position of the fourth figure\u2019s legs (fig. 25.12t). In later states Matisse used black contour lines, but he added streaks of vermilion much later in the painting process as visual tie-ins to the earlier orange-red contours, like on the legs of the first bather (fig. 25.13t).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the initial painted black sketch lines consist mainly of bone black with some lead white. The medium is estimated to be oil.\n\nOrange-red painted sketch lines for the figures consist of zinc white and vermilion, sometimes with the addition of iron oxide red and aluminum silicate. The medium is estimated to be oil.\n\nThere is not enough evidence to point to changes in the initial painted sketch stage before additional painted layers were added, although some of the additional lines visible in the transmitted infrared image, may be from adjustments made to the painted sketch.\n\nThe picture was painted in six separate campaigns spread over at least eight years but was always composed of four equidistant nudes in a spare, abstract landscape with a waterfall and a small snake. Essentially, there are several different paintings beneath the final surface. Archival photographs, technical imaging, and cross-sectional analysis have shed considerable light on how the picture developed and changed.\n\nIn each campaign, Matisse painted most of the different elements with a single, flat layer of paint (fig. 25.14t). In contrast to this flatter application, he painted the waterfall\u2019s pink tones in a more expressionistic, layered manner. Already present in the first state, the waterfall\u2019s divergent technique can be most clearly ascertained in the digitally stitched and corrected reconstruction of photographs of the canvas taken by Alvin Langdon Coburn in Mattise\u2019s studio on May 3, 1913 (hereafter referred to as the Coburn photograph; fig. 25.15t). In the fourth state, the artist similarly applied the varied swatches of gray, black, and white in freely brushed layers that created the atmospheric gray background seen in the photograph of the painting taken by Druet in fall 1913, which documents the fourth state (fig. 25.16t). But for the final version he returned to relatively flat applications of paint in the schematic background bands. Matisse\u2019s palette remained simple. By analyzing a number of cross sections it was possible to assign colors to figures and background areas. For instance, the pink waterfall has been differentiated from the pink of the figures, because the former contains lead white and red lake pigments, while vermilion and zinc white were the primary pigments used for the bathers. Furthermore, by correlating colors and layers, it has been possible to determine which forms belonged to the same campaign because they were painted with the same pigment mixture or appear in the same layer of the cross sections. For example, the first position of the second figure, initially near the bottom edge, is now completely covered by the green band and gray plant (fig. 25.17t). However, cross sections from the area of the gray plant show the same light-vermilion-pink paint covering the ground was also used for the leftmost bather, signifying that, initially, the seated figure\u2019s legs were indeed painted near the bottom edge, below the present gray plant (fig. 25.18t).\n\nMatisse left some areas of each earlier campaign exposed when he repainted and incorporated them into the newly developing forms, so it is possible to observe some parts of the earlier states and their colors on the finished painting itself.\n\nThe pink of the first bather\u2019s right leg remained from the earliest state to the final one, but Matisse reshaped it with black wedges into a more slender form before encasing it in its final trunk-like proportions (fig. 25.19t). The beginning of this change is first observed in the Coburn photograph (see fig. 25.15t), and a second stage, closer to the final version, can be discerned in the transmitted-infrared image (fig. 25.20t).\n\nIn many areas, bright yellow-green is found directly on the ground, indicating that this was the first background color. At a later stage, the yellow-green background was changed to a medium green that corresponds to the darker background seen in the assembled Coburn photograph. The position of an initial pink head on the fourth bather, seen in transmitted infrared, was changed from bent sideways to upright; cross-sectional analysis indicates that this occurred between the first yellow-green and second medium-green background forays (fig. 25.21t; fig. 25.22t). In the case of third bather\u2019s right thigh, a cross section shows that it was added after both the initial yellow-green and second medium-green background colors, suggesting that the repositioning of the leg occurred later in the painting process (fig. 25.23t). Similarly, a cross section from the back of the first figure shows that it was added after both green backgrounds (fig. 25.24t). It can be surmised that this figure\u2019s original stance was bent over at the waist, so the head, right shoulder, and arm were in what is now the vertical stripe of spiky green foliage. However, cross sections from the area do not show the pink from this figure\u2019s initial bent position; Matisse largely scraped away the early layers rather than painting over them (fig. 25.25t). The transmitted-infrared image clearly shows the strokes of scraping here as well as in other areas, and the X-ray indicates the anomalous circular area where the scraping of the early upper torso of this bather occurred.\n\nFirst state (March\u2013May 1909)  \nThe initial composition was similar to Matisse\u2019s watercolor sketch Composition No. II (see fig. 25.26t), in which nude figures lounge beside a waterfall and river in an otherwise empty landscape. The first state of Bathers by a River, begun in March 1909, was identified by the paint layers that lie directly on the ground in the cross sections and the forms in the X-ray, transmitted-infrared, and specular light to which these first layers of colors could be assigned (fig. 25.27t). At this stage, except for the waterfall, the paint was applied as relatively flat, undifferentiated color over broad areas. The application, colors, and general effect were probably similar to that of Matisse\u2019s Nymph and Satyr, completed in February 1908 (fig. 25.28t). As in this earlier work, Matisse painted the background of Bathers by a River bright yellow-green and the figures pink with orange-red contours. In Bathers the third figure had orange hair with purple shading (fig. 25.29t), and she initially stood in the river reaching toward the snake, which was originally yellow-green (see fig. 25.30t). The X-ray and cross sections show that this head was later covered with paint layers from the waterfall when the bent-over position of the figure was gradually adjusted to a more upright posture in the second through fifth states (fig. 25.31t). In the first state, the fourth figure was apparently holding a length of blue-green cloth stretched diagonally across her torso that, together with its black sketch lines, was painted directly on the ground (fig. 25.32t). The first bather, bent at the waist, may originally have been slipping a pale blue-green shirt over her head\u2014in 1926 Matisse still described this figure as the one \u201cremoving her shirt\u201d (fig. 25.33t). This early rendition was scraped, but one cross section shows a pale blue-green as the first layer on top of the ground, which may have been the shirt (fig. 25.34t).\n\nAlthough the X-ray seems to show an early high horizon line, near the top edge, the only area that Matisse painted as sky was a pocket of dark blue in the center above the waterfall (see fig. 25.35t; see fig. 25.36t). Other areas above this line appear to have been painted as continuations of the green background. The watercolor sketch predating the painting shows the same layout for the sky (see fig. 25.26t). The waterfall in Bathers by a River was painted mostly pink, with streaks of turquoise (see fig. 25.37t). Deep blue was used along the waterfall\u2019s edge and for ripples surrounding the third figure\u2019s submerged legs (fig. 25.38t). The waterfall widened into a river toward the bottom, with pale blue-green water at the bottom edge. Traces of tan and brown were found as first layers that delineated a riverbank upon which the second bather had initially sat or crouched (fig. 25.39t).\n\nSecond state (fall 1909\u2013spring 1910)  \nMatisse made a number of changes to the initial composition. These are areas that clearly constitute a second paint layer above the ground but do not correspond to what is seen in the third state as depicted in the Coburn photographs taken on May 13, 1913 (fig. 25.40t). Matisse probably began to paint the landscape a darker medium green at this point. He also made adjustments to all the figures: for example, the proper right arm of the fourth bather, which initially seemed to be holding up a towel, was made to simply bend back above her head in an odalisque-like gesture (fig. 25.41t); the blue-green cloth was eliminated. The new forearm, with its orange-red contours, was painted over the initial green background, proof that it was a change (fig. 25.42t). The proper left arm is now held farther out to the right and is balanced by the thigh and knee, now thrown out farther to the left. The third figure became a little more upright\u2014a new head with yellow hair was painted higher up, over the pink and turquoise waterfall (see fig. 25.43t). The most significant compositional change was the repositioning of the seated second figure up and back into the pictorial space, to sit at the base of the waterfall, who now appears smaller than the other bathers. Like a piece of sculpture, Matisse rotated her to a more frontal position, with one leg dangling over the water. The figure\u2019s previous lower position on the riverbank, along with the bank on the other side, was painted out with black and dark brown (fig. 25.44t). These large dark expanses did not relate to the existing color range and were harbingers of something new to come.\n\nThird state (May 1913)  \nIn the third state of Bathers by a River, documented by the assembly of Coburn\u2019s May 1913 photographs, a complex development of form and color was under way. The black and dark brown used to paint out the riverbank are still visible under the new pink contours sketched for the third figure\u2019s legs (fig. 25.45t). Darker green has been added as background, which at some later point covered the whole background except for the waterfall and the patch of dark blue sky above (an area cut off in the Coburn images). Against these now darker surrounding tones, the brushy, varied passages of the pale pink waterfall, even in this black-and-white photograph, read as a tumultuous force down the center of the picture.\n\nDuring the third state Matisse began to shift toward more abstracted forms, for example the sharp vertical line added to contain the waterfall on its left edge and separate it from the adjacent green (see previous image). He also reshaped the figures in a more abstract manner. He emphasized large smooth curves and sharp angles, such as the third figure\u2019s rounder head, sharp waist, and square shoulder. The outline of the seated figure\u2019s entire side on the left, from neck to ankle, is a single smooth semicircular line. This side has been enlarged: her former shoulder just covers the current curve of her raised knee and thigh. The left leg has grown to enormous proportions compared to the other leg, still its previous size. The shape of the snake has been adjusted to trace a smoother curve. The standing figures have become more upright. On the third figure, the transmitted-infrared image shows a ribbed band that marks her back edge, an echo of which is still visible in the finished painting (fig. 25.46t). For the fourth figure Matisse sketched out the shorter upright head that is visible in transmitted infrared and makes its appearance between the two different background greens (see fig. 25.42t). The first figure now stands contrapposto with a straight back. The line of the previous bent-over posture is still faintly visible\u2014the new portion of the back appears darker where it was added over the previous dark-green background (fig. 25.47t). Matisse was in the process of reshaping this figure, but he was not finished when Coburn photographed it. Matisse had cut into it with bold dark gray wedges that introduced long, smooth curves to the legs, buttock, stomach, and arm in a reductive, almost sculptural way. On the other hand, he added material to the head, laying down a large area of pale turquoise over the previous green background in preparation for a more specific form, much as he did between his bas reliefs, Back II and Back III (see fig. 25.48t, and fig. 25.49t).\n\nFourth state (early November 1913)  \nBy the time Druet took his photograph of the painting six months later, Matisse had made some dramatic alterations: loosely varied, directional brushwork (fig. 25.50t) and, revealed by cross-sectional analysis, a new palette. He had repainted most of the surface in shades of gray, with the exception of some of the previous pinks in the figures and the turquoise under the first figure\u2019s head (see fig. 25.51t). The many shades of gray create an atmospheric space that surrounds the figures. Matisse added gray scumbles to many of the pinks in the figures, and he scumbled the turquoise with thin pale gray and white, which gave it a gauzy transparency (fig. 25.52t and fig. 25.53t). Certain pink passages in the waterfall were probably still visible at this stage, as many of the brushstrokes from the third state were still visible, but they would have been muted by thin gray scumbles. In the fourth state the waterfall was narrowed so it appeared more distant. The vertical dividing line seen in the Coburn image between the background and left side of the waterfall disappeared. The river at the base of the waterfall became broad and placid, as indicated by the gentle horizontal ripples spreading across its surface. Over the background, a pattern of scalloped black lines, representing foliage, rose on either side of the waterfall (fig. 25.54t). Each row overlapped the one below, creating a sense of spatial recession as the pattern nears the middle of the picture, from which the tufts of grass advanced forward to the bottom edge.\n\nWhile Matisse added some specificity and spatial distance to the landscape, he made the figures more abstract and eliminated facial features and hair. The rendition of the first bather, as an example, is an interesting experiment in abstraction (fig. 25.55t). Two long vertical lines form the outer contours of the body. Another vertical, positioned as a backbone, bears little relation to the body beneath. A long diagonal line from the buttocks loops up over the elbow to form one arm, roping in the background beneath to become part of her body. But within this simple, abstract outer armature, the figure has been modeled with more complexity and subtlety to give the pose expressive definition. The figure\u2019s pink back from the previous state has been shaped into a broad ribbon-like arabesque and modeled with gray to give it depth, expressing the natural curve of a back and shoulder. Its angle was set by the black wedge seen in state three, which had initiated the change in posture, as can be seen by shifting between the two images. The pink within the legs and the black wedge between them from the previous state, which had first suggested a bend at the knee, have been refined and modeled to shape a more naturally rounded calf and inner thigh within the confines of the vertical outer contours. Since this internal definition has primarily been modeled with grays, the figure would fade into the surrounding gray landscape if it were not for the outer black contour lines (fig. 25.56t). Matisse used the contour lines like a knife to cut the figure from the surrounding landscape.\n\nThe other figures underwent a similar transformation. Matisse carved out part of the gray; he then made them taller and more upright by lengthening their legs and moving their heads farther up. With their pink bodies shifting down into the gray edges and background, they would have appeared to be projecting out from the background in bas-relief, as is suggested in the colorized image (see fig. 25.51t). This is in essence the very opposite of the final painting\u2019s effect that follows, where the independent three-dimensional figures seem partially encased in gray, as if turning into stone, and stand in contrast to the flat colors of the final background bands.\n\nFifth state (early spring\u2013November 1916)  \nIn the fifth state, as photographed by Galerie Bernheim Jeune three years later in November 1916, Matisse brought the painting to virtually its final appearance (fig. 25.57t). The figures had been largely retained but were further encased in gray. The differences between the Druet/fourth state of the composition and the final painting represents the changes to the figures that were made during the fifth state (fig. 25.58t). The first figure showed the least amount of alteration. Comparing this with the previous, fourth state shows how Matisse extended the figures yet retained most of their parts and added more gray scumbles. He even made the effort to retain sections of the previous contour lines for the first and fourth figures, although the paint on either side of the lines changed. Comparing the fourth state and the final painting indicates that the figures in the fifth state were made fuller and more statuesque; even the snake is more robust. Matisse reconfigured the heads of all four figures\u2014which, in the case of the second, seated figure, involved scraping away all the layers down to the second green background color (fig. 25.59t). When enlarging the arm of this seated figure, Matisse not only coopted a section of the waterfall from the second state but expanded it with paint edges from the backgrounds remaining from the third, fourth, and fifth states, so that he created strips down the arm almost like archaeological layers (fig. 25.60t).\n\nIn this final reworking of the figures, Matisse introduced more geometric shapes, which are defiantly flat. The faceless heads have become plain ellipses; the breasts on the fourth bather are perfect circles superimposed on the body. Rectangles have been placed over the second figure\u2019s head and chest, behind her hip, and around her left leg (fig. 25.61t). This geometric structure is reinforced by the long diagonal from the elbow to the knee that reads like a mechanical lever balanced on the fulcrum of the knee. For the first bather, the raised arms have been pulled in so they are almost vertical, while the contours of the hips and buttocks have been rounded out, with deep undercuts, so that they are almost circular in form (fig. 25.62t). Matisse has also played with enhancing three-dimensional form within the figure again. To the first figure\u2019s buttocks he added strong pink and pale-blue highlights along with pale-gray faceting that expand the shapes volumetrically. A dark shadow added below the arm of the third figure separates it from the gray hip, but, along with the strong contour lines of the thigh, also helps to create a geometric pod shape (fig. 25.63t). A smooth gray skin has now been fitted over the hip like a rounded sheath. And physically below the pink thigh Matisse left exposed, but lightly scumbled over, a patch of the earlier green of the landscape where he had scraped away a black line.\n\nWhile in the fourth state the figures\u2019 outer contours provided a structural armature, now thick black interior lines provide inner support (fig. 25.64t). Repeated lines for some forms, like multiple exposures, suggest a kind of stop-action capacity for futurist movement, as seen in the third figure\u2019s legs, the dangling leg of the seated figure, and the two contours for the head and arms of the first figure. The smaller head of the first figure seems to bend, recalling her earlier bent-over stance, and her multiple arm lines suggest the movement and earlier narrative of removing her shirt. Three portions of the black semicircular lines from the fourth-state foliage pattern were retained and reused along the top edge above the seated figure and then repeated as strong contour lines for the breasts (see fig. 25.61t).\n\nMatisse began to reintroduce brighter color both in the figures and in the background. On the fourth figure he added a stronger pink after scraping away a previous breast shadow and groin line (fig. 25.65t). Many of the bright-white passages in the figures were late additions, as is traditional for touches of white highlight. White was scumbled over the fourth bather\u2019s black legs and appears as frothy highlights smeared on the arm and leg of the third bather (fig. 25.66t). The white rectangle behind the seated figure\u2019s hip visually pushes the foreshortened leg outward (see fig. 25.61t). On the upper portion of the first figure the streaks of white, painted around the preexisting black lines, suggest shafts of sunlight breaking through the foliage to illuminate her form (see fig. 25.62t).\n\nDuring the three years of this fifth period, Matisse reworked the painting most heavily in the background, introducing a series of flat colored vertical bands behind the figures. Cross sections show that he changed the colors of the bands many times. The far right band had only two color changes: the fourth-state gray was covered with pale blue; the far left band, on the other hand, underwent six color changes. A digital re-creation shows a possible progression for these band changes (see fig. 25.67t). Although without further research it is not possible to conclusively say which bands were changed at the same time, the paint composition provides some clues. Also, the order of adjacent bands can be determined by the overlap where they meet. It seems likely that the first band painted was the center-left pink one, directly replacing the waterfall: the band is in the same position and is the same width as the top of the waterfall and repeats its earliest pink color in a lighter shade (fig. 25.68t). At the same time, a gray snake was added\u2014previously it had been a black snake on the gray water. Cross sections show this band was next painted light blue (fig. 25.69t) and finally black, while the snake became white (fig. 25.70t and fig. 25.71t). Matisse had earlier experimented with black on both sides of the waterfall (fig. 25.72t) and then tried white instead (fig. 25.73t).\n\nThe overlap of adjacent edges shows that the gray rectangle around the seated figure\u2019s leg on the right was left in reserve as the central band was changed to pink (see fig. 25.74t), as was the area above her head, the gray rectangle above the fourth figure, and a strip to the left of the first figure and below her feet. The second set of contour lines for the second figure\u2019s leg on the left were added once the green band was in place, perhaps in conjunction with the leaf lines on the green, indicating that some of the figural changes took place after Matisse had begun to experiment with the background bands (fig. 25.75t). The pale-blue bands on both sides of the fourth bather and on her head (under the present white) have the same pigment composition and thus were probably painted at the same time, directly over the fourth-state gray (fig. 25.76t). The center-left band and the bands farther left, including the left edge, were painted a similar pale blue, but it is slightly different in composition from those cited above, and it is likely that they were painted pale blue together but at a later point than the pale blues on the right (fig. 25.77t).\n\nAlthough Matisse eliminated the previous landscape, he reprised some of its elements. The waterfall was reintroduced more abstractly, as a sequence of paired black lines, curves that initially descended across three blue bands from the right edge, ending at the feet of the seated figure, as the original waterfall had (see fig. 25.77t). This reading of the waterfall/river from right to left asserts a temporal quality that also plays out in the rhythmic and spatial progression of the bands, some pushing forward and others receding, bathing the figures in light or shadow. Matisse also added the black contours of a burgeoning sharp-leaved aloe-like plant over the provisional blue to the left. This wide blue band on the left was next painted bright green with loose, active brushstrokes in a fluid, translucent paint, skirting around the aloe plant\u2019s black lines (fig. 25.78t and see fig. 25.77t). Activating this field further, Matisse added a repeating pattern of upward-curving, deftly painted lance-like leaves, again, made with pairs of black lines. They set the first figure within a leafy terrain and recall the foliage pattern of semicircles from the previous state (see fig. 25.75t).\n\nA similar pattern of leaves was drawn up the leftmost strip on the other side of the first figure. Matisse then painted the green leaves over with gray, setting them off by painting the negative space between them black and incising the boundaries (see fig. 25.70t). He also changed the lance-like aloe leaves from green to gray. In a resourceful leap backward, he reused the light and darker greens from the earliest landscape to become the leaves, on the left edge, by scraping down to them from the gray, through the six intermediate paint layers to reveal each to varying degrees (fig. 25.79t). Up close a cross section of layers is visible: scraping has revealed not only the two greens but also gray, blue, white, and black layers. Some of the scraping even uncovered the white ground and left the beige canvas exposed. The result is a surface that is worn and fractured but also eye-catching, giving the effect of dappled light with a more material presence due to the rough handling. Even more so than in the rest of the painting\u2014where the process of change and transformation is revealed by the earlier layers that were retained and reformed\u2014on this scraped left edge the painting\u2019s lengthy history as well as the experimental nature of the artist\u2019s work is writ large.\n\nSixth state (January\u2013October [?] 1917)  \nThe painting was photographed by Galerie Bernheim Jeune in November 1916, at the end of the fifth state, when it was almost finished (fig. 25.80t). A comparison of this photograph with the finished work reveals that Matisse made two additional significant changes. He reshaped some of the alternating leaves and black spaces on the left edge by additional scraping, lending the leaves a slightly stronger presence over the black negative spaces. He also repainted the pale-blue band between the third and fourth bathers with white. The white joins with the white band on the other side of the third bather, becoming a background that slips behind her and pushes her forward. To make the change, Matisse worked over the pale blue with a thin, stiff-brushed scumble of white paint (fig. 25.81t). The translucent white over pale blue, very close tonally, recalls a mist so thin it seems to capture sunlight and amplify it. In the fourth state Matisse had painted the area next to the waterfall and around the third figure with a very soft, translucent, grayish, misty white that perhaps foreshadowed this effect (fig. 25.82t). On the other hand, the white band on the left side of the third figure in the final version is a more opaque white, painted thickly to block out the previous black (fig. 25.83t).\n\nMatisse had also enlivened the large expanses of other bands during the fifth state, so that in their own way they are as engaging as the figures. The blue of the far right band was a thinly scumbled veil of abstract brushwork covering the fourth-state gray (fig. 25.84t). Somewhat akin to a waterfall, it seems to splash over the rocklike gray surface beneath, down to the bottom edge where the strokes begin to flow more horizontally, in a slightly lighter hue (fig. 25.85t). The central black band is enlivened by patches of directional brushwork that catch the light differently, by drying cracks that occurred soon after painting, and by the admixture of small, varied amounts of white to the black paint (fig. 25.86t). The drying cracks are fissures that reveal the pale blue or even the pink bands underneath. Matisse must have accepted this cracking, as he could have repainted the band. For the green band between the first and second figures, Matisse used a much more liquid paint so he could apply it to that broad band quickly and thinly in bold strokes (fig. 25.78t). The pale blue beneath, being lighter and more reflective, highlights the variations in the active green brushwork on top of it. And overall, there are numerous paint chips dislodged by the artist\u2019s scraping that stuck to still-wet paint surfaces. This added textural effect is not unusual in Matisse\u2019s paintings.\n\nBrushes of various sizes and a knife for scraping.\n\nBased on SEM/EDX analysis, the following pigments were determined present in the various states: lead white, zinc white, cadmium yellow, zinc yellow, strontium yellow, possibly chrome yellow and/or orange, iron oxides yellow, brown and red (with associated silicates, such as aluminum silicate, aluminum potassium silicates), vermilion, red lake with aluminum, phosphorus, and possibly calcium as substrates, cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate type), cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, viridian, cobalt green (cobalt zinc oxide), bone black, carbon-based black (charcoal, based on morphology), calcium sulfate, strontium sulfate (mineral celestite together with some barite), barium sulfate, calcium carbonate, calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite), silica, and silicates. The addition of calcium sulfate and strontium sulfate to the paint mixtures may be somewhat unusual.\n\nFor examples of some of the paint mixtures used for the different states, see fig. 25.87t.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting entered the collection in 1953 with a natural-resin varnish. A methacrylate synthetic varnish was applied on top of the natural-resin varnish in 1962. The varnish layers were removed in 1968, and a PVA-AYAA synthetic resin varnish was applied. The synthetic coating was removed in 2007, and no new varnish was applied (see Conservation History). There is no evidence of an original varnish layer.\n\nDuring transit to San Francisco in 1952, a piece of broken wood from the center rail in the crate made a seven-by-one-inch tear near the bottom edge, adjacent to the snake. The painting was returned to New York, where it was patched and restored by Paul Moro in conjunction with the Riportella Studio.\n\nCondition notes on file indicate that the painting was unlined but had a recent (not discolored) natural-resin varnish when it entered the collection in 1953.\n\nIn 1962 extensive interlayer cleavage was consolidated, and a methacrylate synthetic varnish was applied on top of the existing varnish.\n\nIn 1968 the synthetic and natural-resin varnishes were removed, along with some old overpaint. The canvas was wax-resin lined. The stretcher was replaced with a new redwood ICA spring stretcher, larger than the original stretcher by 1\u20133 cm on the top and both sides. A PVA-AYAA synthetic varnish was applied and losses inpainted. As part of the inpainting, some of the areas that Matisse had scraped down, particularly on the left side, were overpainted. Some of the thin areas in the rightmost, more translucent white band were overpainted to make them more opaque, especially near the more opaque white band to the left.\n\nIn 2007 all varnishes (including remnants of the pre-1953 natural resin) and the 1968 inpainting were removed, as well as remnants of tissue facing and discolored starch paste. Some older oil repaints could not be removed. The painting was removed from the stretcher, which was disassembled and cut down as close to the size of the original as feasible. The painting was restretched along the original fold lines. Now close to its original dimensions, the composition actively engages the edges rather than dissipating into featureless tacking margins, which had been visible on the larger stretcher. Losses were filled, and along with the insoluble oil repaint, retouched.\n\nThe scraping along the left edge was compared to a 1926 photograph, taken when the painting was first acquired from the artist by Paul Guillaume and offered for sale to Alfred Barnes. A few more recent losses aside, the scraping was found to be identical to the cleaned state, proving that it was indeed by Matisse\u2019s hand and could be left without retouching.\n\nIn the area of the black band, drying cracks were not retouched since they had occurred soon after the area was painted and while the painting was still in Matisse\u2019s possession. However, the light inner edges of the later mechanical cracks were judged to be distracting in some spots, so they were lightly toned.\n\nThe picture is in very good condition. The lining stabilized the paint layer, and there has been no cleavage since 1968. Because the paint is layered and quite thick, the lining did not cause weave impression, and staining of the canvas from the wax-resin adhesive did not have a visible effect. However, scattered impasto and paint chips were somewhat flattened with moats from the lining pressure. Because the painting was so big, the artist had rolled it; as a result there are many long vertical cracks. There is a chained pattern of cracks extending horizontally in a few spots, probably caused by crushing the rolled painting in those places. There are other mechanical cracks scattered throughout.\n\nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a twenty-first-century, American, L-shaped, molding frame. The frame has a black-stained and waxed finish over a mahogany molding. The frame has been contoured to match to curvatures of the painting\u2019s stretcher. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is straight outer side and fillet face (fig. 25.88).\n\nPrevious frame (installed 1991; removed 2009): The painting was previously housed in a twentieth-century, American, tacking-margin strip frame. The frame had a thin wash of black-oil paint and black wax over poplar moldings. The moldings were applied with nails to the tacking margins and butt jointed at the miters. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was straight outer side and fillet face.\n\nPrevious frame (installed after 1961; removed 1991): The painting was previously framed in a twentieth-century, American, walnut molding frame with a varnished finish and a gilded fillet liner with an angled sight edge. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was straight side, flat face, fillet, with an angled sight edge. This frame was designed by James Speyer (fig. 25.89).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1952; removed after 1961): The painting was previously framed in a wooden tacking-margin frame that projected above the face of the painting. It appears to have been made of unfinished wood and was mitered and nailed to the stretcher of the painting (fig. 25.90).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Paul Guillaume (1891\u20131934), Paris, Sept. 14, 1926\u20131934.\n\nBy descent to his wife, Mme.

The X-ray was recomposited and reregistered at a higher resolution for this study by Kelly Keegan, Associate Conservator, Art Institute of Chicago, who also suppressed the stretcher, hardware, and bands and registered all other images in the overlays.\n\nStephanie D\u2019Allessandro concludes that the painting was likely complete in 1917, hence the dating followed here. See D\u2019Allesandro in Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, exh cat. (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago; New York: Museum of Modern Art, 2010). Photographed by Paul Guilliaume, fall 1926. Archives of the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1953\\_158\\_Matisse\\_Bathers\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is possible that the right and possibly the left selvage are still extant. The tacking margins were not checked for selvages. The already wide loom width and the extrawide side tacking margins devoid of ground suggest the selvages are still present, but this can only be confirmed if the painting is ever unframed.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson, \u201cThread Count Report: Bathers by a River,\u201d May 2017.\n\nThese appear to be the final foldover lines from when the painting was completed. Matisse himself restretched the canvas at least twice after it had been rolled, when the work was still in process.\n\nSee Lawrence Majewski and Alfred Jakstas, examination report, Nov. 9, 1962, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe original stretcher bar width was determined by the pressure marks from Matisse\u2019s scraping on the left edge (see Technique under State V).\n\nThe stretcher is new and the canvas is lined, so any marks would be masked.\n\nA ground and canvas sample was not taken, making it difficult to determine if a sizing layer is present. Evidence of a sizing layer was not seen in the cross sections that contain the complete ground layer.\n\nBecause the loom width of the fabric was not much wider than the width of the painting, there was no reason for Matisse to cut the edge. However, the ground appears to have bled into the cut edge of the fabric along the top side, suggesting that this side was cut before it was primed and that this edge was also retained when the canvas was stretched. This edge was not examined for holes from the stretching for priming.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1953\\_158\\_Matisse\\_Bathers\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using FTIR analysis; see Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Gautier, \u201cMatisse\\_FTIR results\\_summary\\_2011, June 13, 2011. XRF analysis was conducted by Anik\u00f3 Bezur, see \u201cXRF\\_results\\_summary,\u201d February 8, 2006. SEM/EDX of paint cross sections was conducted over a five-year period. Analysts included Anik\u00f3 Bezur, Benjamin Myers, Kate Venmar, and Inge Fiedler; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1953\\_158\\_Matisse\\_Bathers\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d October 19, 2017; all reports on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe technique is also visible in the Coburn photographs on the edge of the second bather after she was moved to a higher position. At times the artist used such black areas to edge forms on finished works, such as the contemporaneous Nude with a White Scarf (Mar.\u2013May 1909; Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen).\n\nInge Fiedler, \u201cMatisse\\_Bathers\\_cross\\_section\\_results\\_summary,\u201d Aug. 11, 2009, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. All analyzed layers of black in the painting were identified as bone black, including the painted sketch lines. Calcium and phosphorus were detected with trace to minor amounts of sodium and magnesium, both of which are often found when bone black is present.\n\nEstimation of an oil medium is based on knowledge of the artist\u2019s technique and materials. No analysis was performed.\n\nInge Fiedler, \u201cMatisse\\_Bathers\\_cross\\_section\\_results\\_summary,\u201d Aug. 11, 2009; on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMatisse usually, but not always, would wipe away with solvent the components that he wished to change (Questionnaire II from Alfred Barr, Mar. 1950, Archives of the Museum of Modern Art), p. 188. John Elderfield Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, 1978. In a painting this large though, elements would have more of a chance of drying before being changed and Matisse would paint over or scrape away areas that were already dry when he wanted to change them.\n\nFor example, using software developed specifically for our research into Matisse\u2019s technique for Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, coorganized by the Art Institute of Chicago and the Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2010. Photographs of the earlier states of the painting were corrected for lens and angle distortions resulting from the painting\u2019s large size and the varied angles of the shots. Only with accurate assemblies and overlays could the cross-sectional samples of the paint layers be interpreted correctly.\n\nAlvin Langdon Coburn photographed Matisse on May 13, 1913, in several shots in front of Bathers by a River for his publication Men of Mark (see curatorial figs. 25.34\u201325.35). His shots did not include the entire painting, particularly not the top edge and where Matisse stood in front of the fourth figure. Individual images were corrected for perspective and camera lens distortions, and manually registered to corresponding features visible in Druet\u2019s November 1913 image of Bathers, the X-ray, and the transmitted-infrared image. The early stages of research relied on a composite of the Coburn images generated by specially-developed imaging software to correct for perspective and lens distortions developed by by Robert G. Erdmann, Rijksmuseum, University of Amsterdam, and Radboud University, Nijmegen.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201cMatisse\\_Bathers\\_cross\\_section\\_results\\_summary,\u201d Aug. 11, 2009, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFrom these images it can also be discerned that the pink on the first figure\u2019s buttock is a late addition.\n\nThis change in background color apparently began during the second state and continued into the third state because changes to the figures sometimes predate and sometimes postdate the change in greens. Still later, in the fifth state, a bright-green band of foliage was painted between the two figures at left.\n\nAs in the watercolor, the third figure stood in the water up to her thighs with her back to the viewer, and the second figure crouched nearby on the river bank with her legs in the water.\n\nSometimes the lines in the X-ray are not clear so some allowance should be made for the contours assigned to State I and II. The transmitted-infrared image was available only after the publication of Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917 in 2010. Specular light revealed texture of the third figure\u2019s early arm and head under the later black band.\n\nMatisse to Georges Duthuit, Oct. 21, 1926, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. Perhaps the presence of the shirt and towel were a nod in response to Shchukin\u2019s request for no nudity, when he was considering the painting for his home (see curatorial essay).\n\nSee note 26.\n\nThe two curved lines across the legs were picked up from the earlier state, where they were blue lines representing ripples in the water at the point of immersion.\n\nThe fourth figure is not visible in the Coburn assembly.\n\nColorized visualization created by Sotirios A. Tsaftaris; see Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Kristin Lister, Inge Fiedler, and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, \u201cColorizing a Masterpiece,\u201d IEEE Signal Processing Magazine 28, no. 3 (May 2011), 113\u201319, DOI:10.1109/MSP.2011.940408.\n\nThe figures were then remodeled with additional grays.\n\nAlong with many parts of the figures, a few additional aspects remain unchanged in the final painting, such as the turquoise under the head area of the first figure, and the grays below her feet, as well as the gray behind the top half of the fourth figure. Also retained are the black semicircular foliage lines still visible to the left of her head with the previous shoulder line. Three foliage lines from the fourth state are also incorporated into the rectangle over the seated figure\u2019s head.\n\nAn image comparing the illuminations from the Druet photo and the final painting was derived from numerous spot samples of color (color hints) from the final painting that had not changed since the Druet photo, and a colorizing algorithm. The image shows areas that remained more or less identical, (ratio values -0.1\u20130.1 or up to 10% difference) and where the final painting is similar but darker (R values 0.1\u20131.3), usually from additional layers of gray. Areas that have changed more extensively are also shown. This image was adapted by Sotirios A. Tsaftaris; see Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Kristin Lister, Inge Fiedler, and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos, \u201cColorizing a Masterpiece,\u201d IEEE SignalProcessing Magazine 28, no. 3 (May 2011), 13\u201319, DOI:10.1109/MSP.2011.940408.\n\nThe scraping also revealed the dark blue of the waterfall for part of the head.\n\nThe thick black line down the middle of her back brings to mind the braid in Matisse\u2019s bas-relief Back (III) of 1913\u201316.\n\nThis white was probably added at the same time that the first, grayish white band was added to the right of the waterfall, since the pigment mixture is the same in both (zinc white and calcium sulfate) and different from the other whites used at this stage.\n\nAtop the Druet gray, these band layers were pale blue, white, black, white again, pale blue, green, and finally black or gray.\n\nThese changes to the figures are not included in the sequential diagrams of the background bands.\n\nThe right-side pale blues are composed of lead white, calcium sulfate, and some ultramarine blue. The later, left-side blues are composed of lead white, strontium sulfate, barium sulfate, and some ultramarine blue. The blue above the seated figure was not sampled.\n\nIn the final painting these paired lined descend across a blue, white and black band. The idea may have been suggested by the arms of the middle standing figure, paired lines that converge and seem to pour into the next band (the waterfall band) in a similar manner, as they had particularly in the Coburn state.\n\nThis was where the pressure of scraping from the right encountered the hard edge of stretcher, and also where scraping from the left with the strong pressure needed to scrape off the six layers over the green, suddenly met with only one layer of gray over the green adjacent to the figure, and dug deeper than intended. The multiple layers of the left edge band were just about the same width as the stretcher bar.\n\nThe scraping that reveals bits of different layer colors might even be seen as a more exuberant form of the pointillism (a technique earlier abandoned by Matisse), where small areas of different colors are mixed in the viewer\u2019s eye rather than on the palette, in this case mixing to create a softer, gray-green hue, but with a strong retinal vibration.\n\nProviding less contrast with the figure, the previous pale-blue band may have pressed too tightly against the almost vertical line of her back.\n\nWhen he added this white layer he also painted over a small black line to the right of the third figure\u2019s shoulder. It was the remnant of a foliage line from the fourth state that had been left when the bands were first added.\n\nThe pigment mixture of this soft gray is zinc white with a large proportion of calcium sulfate, the dullness of the latter when mixed with oil accounts for the translucent grayish appearance.\n\nThis small area between the edge and the legs was first defined by the diagonal contour of figure four\u2019s crossed leg in the first state, when below it was pale-blue water.\n\nAs he covered the band with black, Matisse carefully painted around the black waterfall lines, leaving a halo of blue, so the lines would remain visible. This makes the lines seem deep within the slit of blue. The white band to the right was also painted after the waterfall line, but a halo of blue was not necessary because he was not dealing with a black line and a black surround. The color of the far right band was not changed, so the black lines are simply painted on top of the blue. Because these lines are on top, and also because they are thicker and more widely spaced, they seem farther forward than the other two sets of waterfall lines, which seem to be spaced progressively farther back in space.\n\nThe drying cracks are visible in the 1926 photograph sent to Alfred Barnes to ask if he was interested in purchasing the painting. The November 1916 photograph by Bernheim Jeune is too dark in this area to show cracks. There are also vertical mechanical cracks from rolling the painting that may have occurred later, when the paint was more brittle.\n\nMcCrone Associates conducted electron microprobe analysis of a sample of green paint in the foliage; see results summary, May 24, 1978. XRF analysis was conducted by Anik\u00f3 Bezur; see \u201cXRF\\_results\\_summary,\u201d February 8, 2006. SEM/EDX analysis of paint cross sections was conducted over a five-year period. Analysts included Anik\u00f3 Bezur, Benjamin Myers, Kate Venmar, and Inge Fiedler; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1953\\_158\\_Matisse\\_Bathers\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 19, 2017; all reports on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn the paints used for Bathers by a River, calcium sulfate and strontium sulfate are found mostly mixed with lead white and occasionally with zinc white, in the case of calcium sulfate. If Matisse was using paints from different manufacturers or manufactured at different dates, this could account for the varied presence of these additives. Both calcium sulfate and strontium sulfate are virtually transparent in oil paint and may have been added as extenders by the manufacturer or by Matisse himself. Although calcium sulfate was found in small quantities in some of the earlier paint layers, its use was much more prevalent in the later paint layers. A form of calcium sulfate is also used for plaster, which Matisse was using for his sculptures at this time. Strontium sulfate was only found used in the later paint mixtures. Natural strontium sulfate often contains about 2%\u20133% BaSO<sub>4</sub>. The use of strontium sulfate as a pigment seems fairly rare. Artist materials became less plentiful during the war and were more likely to be extended with such fillers. Matisse may have added these whites as an extender since paint for such a large canvas would have been costly, or perhaps for more transparent effects. Strontium sulfate, because of the impurities that accompany it, can also present a bluish tone, and it is in the blue bands in Bathers by a River where the strontium sulfate is primarily found.\n\nFor analysis of the pigments identified in the six states, see Inge Fiedler, \u201cMatisse\\_Bathers\\_cross\\_section\\_results\\_summary,\u201d Aug. 11, 2009, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.
