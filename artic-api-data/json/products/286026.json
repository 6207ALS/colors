This scarf is to be worn like a talisman that brings luck wherever you go. One side is decorated with jewel-like charms emitting good energy, and the other is splashed with vibrant peacock feathers that represent kindness and compassion. Created by Lisa Ivarsson, a Swedish print and fashion designer based in Barcelona. All DESEDA silk scarves are designed by emerging artists from around the world. Their original artwork is printed on luxe silk in Italy, then finished in the U.S. in limited editions.</span></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>2 x 32 in.</li><li><strong>Materials: </strong>100% silk twill<strong><br></strong></li><li><strong>Care Instructions: </strong>Dry clean only<strong><br></strong></li></ul>",
