He was speaking of the millions of folding and rigid fans that were being imported to Europe from China and Japan at that time. Artists in late nineteenth-century Paris were particularly taken with anything and everything Japanese. Among the many attractions of Japanese art and culture was the fan, whose shape in particular drew artists such as Edgar Degas, who had supported Gauguin\u2019s work at critical moments, and especially Camille Pissarro, who had mentored him, to explore the many ways they could use the format to invent new motifs (see fig. 131.2 and fig. 131.3). Images of fans also appeared frequently in paintings of the period, such as \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Lady with Fans, in which he surrounded his model, Nina de Callias, with fans pinned to the wall behind her (fig. 131.4). Degas even envisioned that an entire gallery in the 1879 Impressionist exhibition be devoted to fan designs. Unfortunately, although Degas, along with Pissarro and Jean-Louis Forain, submitted fans for display, the special room never happened.\n\nGauguin began creating fan-shaped compositions around 1884, fairly early in his artistic career. He produced over two dozen such designs over his lifetime, employing a diverse selection of media, from gouache and watercolor to lithography. He also utilized a variety of supports, ranging from paper to canvas to silk. None of Gauguin\u2019s fans were ever mounted for use. According to Douglas Druick, this example was quite probably Gauguin\u2019s last. He most likely painted it in the Marquesas Islands, where he lived from 1902 until his death in 1903.\n\nGauguin\u2019s reasons for making fans may have been commercial as well as artistic. Although the artist\u2019s aesthetic concerns changed considerably over the years, he was always keen to make money, and he thought that fans could be a potential source of income. Fans from East Asia had long been a status symbol among the French aristocracy. In the eighteenth century, they began to be printed instead of hand painted, making them more available; by the nineteenth century, the fan had become a popular accessory of the French bourgeoisie and obtainable for purchase in department stores. Perhaps for Gauguin the Japanese fan also possessed an inherently \u201cexotic\u201d appeal, with its roots in Asian culture and imagery.\n\nThis fan design depicts a coastal landscape, with the ocean visible at the top center. A small hut sits near the water. The focal point is the blue statue of the Tahitian goddess Hina, situated to the left of center. Her position is similar to the one she occupies in Gauguin\u2019s monumental Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (fig. 131.5 [W 561]). Here, the statue\u2019s just off-center location seems to anchor the composition within a Polynesian setting more than it connotes specific symbolic meaning.\n\nHina first appeared in a painting entitled Mahana no atua (Day of the God), which Gauguin executed in Paris in 1894 (cat. 72 [W 513]). Thereafter, the goddess appeared often in the artist\u2019s canvases, drawings, and prints. His knowledge of Tahitian spiritual beliefs and myths principally derived from his reading of a book published in 1837 by Belgian businessman and trader Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (Travels to the Islands of the Pacific Ocean). Moerenhout presented this volume as a study of the history and religion of Tahiti; yet the stories of Tahitian religion recorded in it were dictated to him by an elderly native priest decades after missionaries had succeeded in converting the Tahitians to Christianity, which placed the priest at a remove from beliefs and rituals that had more or less been discontinued. In his thus somewhat unreliable account, Moerenhout discussed the goddess Hina at length. Associated with the moon, she was the female counterpart of the creator god Ta\u2019aroa. Hina represented continual cycles and rebirths, something perhaps echoed in the semicircular shape of the fan itself.\n\nMuch of the Art Institute\u2019s fan comprises areas of brilliant color that suggest hills, grassy knolls, rocks, water, and paths. Within this landscape can be discerned a number of people and animals, not only inspired from Gauguin\u2019s first trip to the South Seas, but also taken from paintings that he had made after he returned to Polynesia from France in 1895. On the left side of the composition is a small female bather, a figure found in Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? Below her is a blue bird; exotic avians feature in many of Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti-inspired canvases, such as Matamoe (Landscape with Peacocks) (fig. 131.6 [W 484]). On the fan\u2019s right side is a horse and rider. Druick identified the source for this motif in a 1902 painting, Riders on the Beach (fig. 131.7 [W 620]), which Gauguin executed just prior to creating this fan.\n\nPopulating this swirling, somewhat abstract landscape with fragments from prior works, each motif situated in its own corner of the composition, Gauguin created an image in which figures, animals, and architecture are subsumed into a fluid setting that emphasizes the decorative nature of the fan itself. His use of line, color, and shape creates a spatial arrangement that is deliberately ambiguous, with dark-blue brushstrokes separating the areas of color, resulting in a brightly hued image replete with texture and pattern.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the family of Flora David-Weill (n\u00e9e Raphael, 1878\u20131970), Neuilly-sur-Seine, France, to Wildenstein and Company, Paris, 1971.\n\nSold by Wildenstein and Company, Paris, to Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, 1971.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 246 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, as Gauguin, Jan. 10\u2013April 20, 1989.\n\nAuckland (New Zealand) City Art Gallery, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, Aug. 4\u2013Oct. 15, 1995, cat. 35 (ill.).\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.

This was also the first Impressionist exhibition in which Gauguin was involved.

The artist\u2019s 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori religion) is on deposit from the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, held by the D\u00e9partement des Arts Graphiques, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, bequest of \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, RF 10755. Gauguin\u2019s recurring use of the figure of Hina in this, one of his late works, illustrates the power Polynesian mythology held for him to the end of his life.\n\nDouglas Druick, \u201cDesign for a Fan Featuring a Landscape and Statue of the Goddess Hina,\u201d Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 30, no. 1 (2004), p. 85.

Peter Zegers identified related motifs in a number of works that date from 1896 on (W 548, 561, 564, 568\u201369, 576, 579, 585, 598, 620, and 622); see curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDouglas Druick, \u201cDesign for a Fan Featuring a Landscape and Statue of the Goddess Hina,\u201d Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 30, no. 1 (2004), p. 85.\n\nJune Hargrove argued that, particularly in the works Gauguin produced in the Marquesas, there is visible tension between the artist\u2019s \u201cmeaning and abstraction in his late use of symbolism.\u201d June Hargrove, \u201cWoman with a Fan: Paul Gauguin\u2019s Heavenly Vairaumati\u2014a Parable of Immortality,\u201d Art Bulletin 88, no. 3 (Sept. 2006), pp. 552\u201366. Infrared reflectography revealed a more considered graphite underdrawing than encountered in other Gauguin watercolors. She also deduced that in the process of heightening the design with watercolor, the artist removed the fruit from the tree in the background to the right, thereby negating any association it could have with the Tree of Knowledge.
