    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This group of works is the core of the Edlis/Neeson Collection and perhaps the finest collection of Andy Warhol paintings in any encyclopedic museum.</p>\n<p>For Warhol, content and process went hand-in-hand.  Starting in the early 1960s, he turned to mass culture to find images for his paintings\u2026and used a mass market technique\u2014the photomechanical silkscreen\u2014to transfer those images onto canvas. Director James Rondeau.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: The advantage of seeing works of art by Andy Warhol in a single room is you see not only the range of his practice, but a thread of an idea that runs through.</p>\n<p>So, there are images that seem to be overtly beautiful and glamorous, and on the other hand, there are images that seem to be very much about trauma and violence.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: In some cases, he combined them both\u2014such as selecting an image of Jackie Kennedy after her husband\u2019s assassination, or, in his portrait of Elizabeth Taylor.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: We maybe lose the context from the early 1960s where Liz Taylor was as much a picture about disaster as about glamour. Warhol, for instance, began working with Liz\u2019s image only after he found a newspaper photograph of her being carried off an airplane in a hospital gurney with pneumonia, near death.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: As you see here, no subject was sacred. And with silkscreening, he could easily manipulate color and play with repetition until an image was often rendered nearly meaningless.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: There\u2019s a kind of leveling effect where Warhol is saying, \u201cCelebrities are the same as tragedy; banal images of beauty are the same as death and disaster; objects are the same as people.\u201d Almost everything is the same.</p>\n",
