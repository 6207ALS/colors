    "description": "<p>In this living-history performance, actress and historian Leslie Goddard, Ph.D., portrays Georgia O'Keeffe, the legendary artist and modernist. As O'Keeffe reflects on her life, she discuses her intense closeness to flowers, nature, and the landscape around her homes in New Mexico. What emerges is a complex person whose myth-making encompassed both her art and her life. <br></p><p>Leslie Goddard is an award-winning actress and scholar who has been presenting history programs for more than ten years. Her programs have been presented for hundreds of museums, libraries, senior centers, clubs, and other organizations around the country. <br></p><p><strong>Schedule of the Day: </strong></p><p>\t10:00 Registration<br>\t11:00 Lecture<br>\t12:00 Lunch</p><p><strong>Lunch menu options: </strong><br></p><ul><li>Chicken shish kebab with rice<br></li><li>Vegetable stir fry over basmati rice</li></ul><p><strong>Speaker: </strong>Leslie Goddard, Ph.D.</p><p><strong>Registration Period: </strong>February 19, 2019\u2013March 5, 2019</p><p>To contact the event planner, please reach out to Becky Sacopoulos at (219) 464-3239. </p><p>This Community Associates event is exclusively for current Community Associates members.
