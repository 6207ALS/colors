    "description": "<p>Before becoming known for his sweeping depictions of the American West, Ansel Adams was a cofounder of Group f/64, an association of West Coast photographers who promoted a modernist aesthetic through technical precision. The group\u2019s name refers to the smallest aperture on a camera lens, which secured the sharpest focus. An impeccable craftsman, Adams worked dilligently in the darkroom to produce pristine prints. His belief that \u201cthe most subtle quality of good photography\u201d was \u201cthe rendering of minute textures\u201d is apparent in the tiny lichens and weather\u2013etched grooves of \u201cOld Shingles.\u201dThis print was included in Adams\u2019s 1936 one\u2013man show at Katherine Kuh\u2019s gallery in Chicago. Kuh would go on to be the Art Institute\u2019s first curator of Modern Painting and Sculpture.</p>\n",
