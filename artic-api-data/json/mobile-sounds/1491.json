    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: These wonderful family portraits were made around 1822 by Ammi Phillips.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: Portrait artists did travel around a great deal in order to find clients. They were often times trained as sign painters which accounts for the flatness of these portraits and the linearity of them and the importance of outline. Phillips was one of the most sophisticated of the early folk portraitists in America. This is Cornelius Allerton and Lois Allerton. They\u2019re mother and son.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Cornelius holds a weighty medical dictionary indicating his profession and social prominence.<br>Judy Barter:  The horse was painted on top of the present pain which means it was added later, we don\u2019t know when. And it may refer to the birth of a child to have this little toy here so that it shows him as a father.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: His mother has an evangelical newspaper in her hand.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  And that\u2019s very interesting to me because in New York state where the Allerton\u2019s were living there was a lot of religious revivalism that happened around 1815 to 1820. And interestingly enough it\u2019s out of that evangelical revivalism that women started meeting together as groups and out of that came the movement of the 1860s with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others who started women\u2019s rights.&quot;</p>\n",
