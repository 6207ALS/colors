These works show only three different views\u2014Charing Cross Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, both painted from the Savoy Hotel; and the Houses of Parliament, painted from Saint Thomas\u2019s Hospital. In the smoggy, industrial city, Monet challenged himself to capture effects of light seen through a dense atmospheric screen. Beyond the rectilinear skeleton of Charing Cross Bridge\u2014reminiscent of bridges in Japanese prints, which the artist collected\u2014rises the ghostlike silhouette of the Houses of Parliament.</p>\n",
