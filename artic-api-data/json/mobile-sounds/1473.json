    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Look closely at this intricate gilded ritual crown and you\u2019ll see its decorated with five Buddhas all seated on lotus blossom thrones. Each Buddha is making a different hand gesture or mudra. The Vajra a diamond or half thunderbolt motif appears at the crown\u2019s apex. The thunderbolt form of the Vajra symbolizes the sudden striking experience of enlightenment.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: We believe that during certain rituals particularly of the Vajrayana form of Buddhism, a particular sect within Buddhism monks would wear such crowns which are adorned with these meditating Dhyani Buddhas in order to identify himself with the cosmic principle and the primordial Adi-Buddha.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Just below the principle Buddha at the center of the crown you\u2019ll see a face of glory or kirtimukha with gemstone eyes and gilt foliage spurting from its mouth. This crown was made in Nepal most likely by a highly skilled Newari craftsman. The Newari\u2019s were renowned for their stunning work with metal and inlays of glittering semiprecious stones.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: What makes this crown even more interesting is the fact that it is inscribed and it is dated. It says that in 1090 in the reign of King Harsha Deva [ph?] this magnificent crown was commissioned by Vajrashila who lives in the Mahavat Buddhist monastery.</p>\n",
