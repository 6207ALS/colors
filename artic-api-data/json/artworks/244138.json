On June 28, 1984, Jenny and her six-year-old daughter Katryn were killed in their home in northern Angola. Jenny had opened a letter bomb that the South African police had intended for her husband. Marius was out of town; their two-year old son Fritz was far enough away from the explosion to survive. Aware of the apartheid government\u2019s desire to assassinate Marius, the family had relocated from Botswana to Angola for safety. The slogan on this poster urges viewers to honor the victims\u2019 legacies through continued resistance.</p>\n",
