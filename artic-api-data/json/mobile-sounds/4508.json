    "transcript": "<p>Hey, Andrew, audio producer at the Art Institute here and welcome to the audio tour for Manet and Modern Beauty, we\u2019re happy you\u2019re listening. Manet was a complex guy. Throughout his career, he wanted to be accepted by the official art world, but often his work was too progressive in its style for critic\u2019s taste. Although Manet was known as the father of Impressionism and inspired artists like Claude Monet, he rejected the label of Impressionist for himself, choosing instead to enter his paintings into the annual competitive Salon exhibitions of the academy. He was both a rebel and a traditionalist, and on the tour you\u2019ll learn about this tension and dive deep into what makes Manet such an intriguing painter of modern life.</p>\n<p>As with all of our tours, we recommend you take the stops in order; however, feel free to jump around using the numbers listed on label next to the artwork. Enjoy the tour, and thank you for listening.</p>\n",
