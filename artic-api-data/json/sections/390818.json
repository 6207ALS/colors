It was probably drawn a week or two after St. Anne\u2019s, Soho (cat. 162), when the arched branches of the trees in the enclosed churchyard were beginning to show the feathery foliage of early spring. We know from the final invoice submitted by the Way firm that the image was transferred and proved on 13 April 1896 (app II.4).\n\nLike St. Anne\u2019s, St. Giles-in-the-Fields is located in Soho. The church still stands on St. Giles Street, between Charing Cross Road and New Oxford Street. Designed by Henry Flitcroft, the structure was built between 1731 and 1733. Flitcroft\u2019s design depended heavily on James Gibbs\u2019s St. Martin-in-the-Fields and Sir Christopher Wren\u2019s plan for St. James\u2019s, Piccadilly. A photograph (fig. 167a) taken on the south side of the building from a vantage point approximating Whistler\u2019s own shows how faithfully the artist recorded the proportions and architectural details of the church. He used the stump extensively to record the budding foliage on branches, to soften drawn lines, and to add deep shadows to architectural elements. As a result the lithograph captures the change of season from late winter to spring.\n\nImpressions of this lithograph vary dramatically in effect. When the stone was lightly inked, the resulting proofs have a delicacy approaching that of a silverpoint drawing. When the ink was applied more heavily, impressions have almost the appearance of charcoal drawings. Impressions also vary due to inconsistencies in the printing of the stump work. Passages of stumping, especially those in the sky at upper right and along the wall behind the seated figures at lower left, often printed faintly, if at all. This is also the case in the majority of impressions printed posthumously.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (278 \u00d7 193 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (286 \u00d7 210 mm), signed.
