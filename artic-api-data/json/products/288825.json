    "description": "Avery Coonley commissioned Frank Lloyd Wright to build the Playhouse for his wife, Queene Ferry, after Wright built the main residence for the couple. Ferry had already built one smaller progressive school and was very interested in the education of children. The Playhouse features one of Wright\u2019s most playful art glass window designs with asymmetrical geometric designs and suggestions of flags, balloons, and confetti. The brightly colored windows bring to mind a parade that Wright referred to as a \u201ckinder symphony.\u201d Since the Playhouse was intended for children\u2019s education and performances, this fun theme was entirely appropriate.<br>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> 12oz</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.5 x 3.25 x 4.25 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> Double wall ultra insulated using high-grade stainless steel</li>\n<li><strong>BPA free</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Dishwasher safe</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Hot or cold for up to 12 hours</strong></li>\n</ul>",
