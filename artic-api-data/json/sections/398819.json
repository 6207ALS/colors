This group of lithographs can be dated with some certainty to the fall of 1897, when the Parisian printer Auguste Clot was editioning Afternoon Tea (cat. 173) for Vollard\u2019s second album of original prints and when he also must have printed Mother and Daughter (cat. 174). The few impressions printed of cat. 175\u201379 all share an experimental quality, suggesting that Whistler brought them to Clot as a group and perhaps lingered in the printer\u2019s shop to supervise as the images were quickly processed and proved. On a sheet now in The Art Institute of Chicago (1927.5875), an impression of the present portrait is printed on the verso, while the recto bears an impression of Portrait Study: Mrs. Philip No. 3 (cat. 178). On another sheet, also in Chicago (1927.5874), a counterproof of this image is printed underneath an impression of Portrait Study: Mrs. Philip No. 4 (cat. 177) and adjacent to an unfinished sketch of one of the Birnie Philip sisters.\n\nThe identity of the woman who sat for this portrait remains a matter of speculation. Whistler\u2019s youngest sister-in-law, [glossary:Rosalind Birnie Philips], has been suggested as the sitter. However, there was considerable family resemblance between Rosalind and her sister Ethel Whibley (despite a twelve-year age difference), and it is often difficult to distinguish them in Whistler\u2019s depictions. There is an intriguing body of evidence to suggest that the sitter was not a family member at all, but rather Fran\u00e7oise Genevi\u00e8ve St\u00e9phanie Mallarm\u00e9 (1864\u20131919), only daughter of Whistler\u2019s close friend, the symbolist poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Whistler painted Genevi\u00e8ve\u2019s portrait at the Mallarm\u00e9 home in Valvins on 20 October 1897 (fig. 176a [YMSM 485]). The widow\u2019s peak discernible in the lithograph was a distinctive feature of her appearance, and is clearly visible in the oil. Since Whistler had already produced a celebrated lithographic portrait of her father in 1892 (cat. 60; see also cat. 59), he may quite naturally have taken up his transfer paper when making his initial studies for the oil portrait of Genevi\u00e8ve. The Mallarm\u00e9 family had a proof of this lithograph (now in the Mus\u00e9e Mallarm\u00e9, Vulaines-sur-Seine), and family tradition holds the sitter to be Genevi\u00e8ve. A late-October dating of this image would also seem to mesh with Whistler\u2019s activities during the autumn of 1897. In mid-October he arrived in Paris to prepare for the appeal of the Eden verdict, and by early November he was printing lithographs with Clot (see cat. 173).\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory plate paper (362 \u00d7 252 mm) (the other side bears a signed impression of cat. 178); counterproof on ivory laid paper (220 \u00d7 355 mm), signed (printed with cat. 177).\n\nRemarks: Another impression is found in Vulaines-sur-Seine, Mus\u00e9e d\u00e9partemental St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9.  \nNesta R.

In this article Margaret MacDonald identified the sitter as Rosalind Birnie Philip and mistakenly gave Goulding as the printer. However, in subsequent correspondence MacDonald acknowledged the difficulty of differentiating the Birnie Philip sisters and also entertained the possibility that the sitter might be Genevi\u00e8ve Mallarm\u00e9. She no longer believes that Goulding printed this image after Whistler\u2019s death; letter of 4 April 1995 from Margaret MacDonald.\n\nThe image was identified as Genevi\u00e8ve Mallarm\u00e9 when a counterproof was reproduced as a \u201cdessin\u201d in the Mallarm\u00e9 issue of Le Point 29\u201330 (February\u2013April 1944), p. 27; and is maintained by the Mus\u00e9e d\u00e9partemental St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Vulaines-sur-Seine.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 176, only state.
