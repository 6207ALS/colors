A conical, tipped weathervane, planets and comets in orbit, and a flaming horizon line are interrupted by the abstract geometries of collaged circles of rust, brown, tan, and white paper.</p>\n<p>Untitled is one of 22 large-scale chromatically austere collages Mir\u00f3 made between July and November 1929. In these works, he kept his drawn lines to a minimum. Mir\u00f3 described his collages as \u201cdrawings with new explorations into substance,\u201d and as \u201ctraining exercises, shadowboxing, so as to hit harder and harder, in a tougher and more energetic way.\u201d</p>\n",
