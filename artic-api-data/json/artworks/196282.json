    "description": "<p>Alvan Fisher was a pioneering American landscapist whose work offered an important precedent for the Hudson River School. This painting depicts a subject from James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s 1827 novel <em>The Prairie</em>, the third of the five Leatherstocking Tales. In this scene, Natty Bumppo, the hero of the series, has created a firebreak to protect the story\u2019s protagonists. As a Romantic-era artist, Fisher preferred such dramatic episodes, which involved striking contrasts between light and dark. Unlike contemporaneous illustrations of the scene, which give little sense of setting, in this version the figures are dwarfed by nature, and the prairie grasses are exquisitely rendered, underscoring the landscape\u2019s beauty as well as its dangers. The work thus suggests the significance of the prairie in Cooper\u2019s text. Perhaps for this reason, the author declared that it was \u201cthe only good illustration he had seen from his books.\u201d</p>\n",
