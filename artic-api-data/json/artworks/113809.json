His nudes are mostly inspired by ancient sources, as in the hanging satyr with his arms raised (based on a famous Hellenistic sculpture of the flayed Marsyas), but Fuseli activates them with his dynamic line.<br>Drawing the human figure dominated artistic training in Fuseli\u2019s day. While sketching from a live model was part of conventional practice, copying ancient Roman sculpture was equally important. Fuseli\u2019s exposure to an abundance of ancient sculpture during his years in Rome (1770\u201378) became a visual catalogue he drew upon throughout  his life.</p>\n",
