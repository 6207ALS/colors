    "description": "<p>Hear from  Suzanne Jackson (b. 1944), whose career spans more than five decades. She has worked experimentally across genres including drawing, painting, printmaking, bookmaking, poetry, dance, theater, and costume design. In her lyrical work from the 1960s and 70s, figures and recurring symbols are built up through multiple layers of acrylic wash on canvas, creating ethereal paintings in which any firm distinction between depicted elements is dissolved.</p>",
