    "description": "<p><strong>This event is SOLD OUT, a standby line will start at 2:00 for tickets that become available.</strong></p><p>Gauguin specialist June Hargrove, University of Maryland, with curator Gloria Groom, discusses the relationship of Gauguin's sculptures and wood-carvings to his creative process. They explore how his radical experiments in three dimensions affect his overall approach to materials and techniques, resulting in deeply intertwined works of art that express profound meaning. </p><p><strong>About the Speaker</strong></p><p><strong>June Hargrove</strong> is professor of 19th-century European painting and sculpture at the University of Maryland. She focuses on European art, particularly French, from the 18th century to the early 20th century. Her scholarship investigates the historical context of art, with an emphasis on the impact of global transformations on style and content in painting and sculpture. In 2012 she received the Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters from the French Government for scholarship about the cultural heritage of France. Her 2014 exhibition <em>Albert Carrier-Belleuse: The Master of Rodin</em> for the Palace of Compi\u00e8gne, north of Paris, explored the marriage of art and industry in the artist\u2019s work, which ranged from sensuous Salon marbles to luxury objects in gold and modest utensils in zinc. The young Rodin collaborated with him intermittently over two decades.</p><p>Professor Hargrove has published a new book on the painting and sculpture of Paul Gauguin, reconsidering his final years in the Marquesas Islands. Her article \u201cPaul Gauguin: Sensing the Infinite\u201d appeared in <em>Sensational Religion: Sense and Contention in Material Practice</em>, edited by Sally Promey for Yale University Press.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
