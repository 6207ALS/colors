    "description": "<p>This event is SOLD OUT, a standby line will start at 6:30pm at the Michigan Avenue entrance for tickets that become available. </p><p>Join us as eclectic guitarist and composer Marc Ribot presents an intimate solo performance in response to the paintings of Ivan Albright. Presented in association with the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibition/flesh-ivan-albright-art-institute-chicago\"><em>Flesh: Ivan Albright at the Art Institute of Chicago</em></a>.</p><p>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p><strong>About the Artist<br></strong></p><p>Marc Ribot has released over 20 albums under his own name over a 35-year career, exploring everything from the pioneering jazz of Albert Ayler to the Cuban <em>son</em> of Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez. Marc's latest solo recording, <em>Silent Movies</em>, released in 2010, was described as a \"down-in-the-mouth near-masterpiece\" by the <em>Village Voice</em> and landed on several \"Best of 2010\" lists, including the <em>LA Times',</em> and received critical praise across the board. </p><p><em>Rolling Stone</em> points out that \u201cGuitarist Marc Ribot helped Tom Waits refine a new, weird Americana on 1985's <em>Rain Dogs</em>, and since then he's become the go-to guitar guy for all kinds of roots-music adventurers: Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, Elvis Costello, John Mellencamp.\u201d Additional recording credits include Soloman Burke, Neko Case, Diana Krall, Beth Orton, Marianne Faithful, Arto Lindsay, Caetano Veloso, Laurie Anderson, Susana Baca, McCoy Tyner, The Jazz Passengers, Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood, Cibo Matto, Jamaaladeen Tacuma, James Carter, Vinicio Capposella (Italy), Auktyon (Russia), Vinicius Cantuaria, Sierra Maestra (Cuba), Alain Bashung (France), Marisa Monte, Allen Ginsburg, Madeleine Peyroux, Sam Phillips, and, more recently, Joe Henry, Allen Toussaint, Norah Jones, Akiko Yano, The Black Keys, Jeff Bridges, Jolie Holland, Elton John/Leon Russell and many others. Ribot frequently collaborates with producer T Bone Burnett, most notably on Alison Krauss and Robert Plant's Grammy Award\u2013winning <em>Raising Sand</em>, and he regularly works with composer John Zorn.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
