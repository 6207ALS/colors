Frames made of wood and foam mimic the ribs and spine of a cow\u2019s torso. They are covered with a hide from a single cow, positioned exactly as it was on the animal. The benches do not feature heads or legs because these are the first parts removed in the slaughterhouse. As opposed to the unmarred leather used for most furniture, Lohmann\u2019s benches bear the unique marks\u2014such as scars and wrinkles\u2014of the cow used to produce them. Creating an even deeper connection with the viewer, each bench has its own name\u2014this one is called Janne.</p>\n",
