    "description": "<p>Born in Germany, the sculptor, printmaker, and photographer Arnold R\u00f6nnebeck studied art in Munich and<br>Paris, where he befriended the American artists Charles Demuth and Marsden Hartley. This work, executed in New York after R\u00f6nnebeck immigrated to the United States in 1923, combines a traditional subject with a Cubist abstraction of form. The artist also produced a sculpture entitled <em>American Wedding</em>, which may have been intended to form a pair with <em>London Wedding</em>. The photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz supported R\u00f6nnebeck\u2019s career and provided him with important connections in the American art world.</p>\n",
