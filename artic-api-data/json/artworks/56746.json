    "description": "<p>The grand scale of Titian\u2019s twelve-sheet woodcut (see 1957.12.1\u201312) mimics history paintings and large wall hangings. The assembled composition would fit only on a massive wall, a use confirmed by the total lack of early impressions. Only this 1549 state is known, printed from woodblocks studded with wormholes, which appear in the image as tiny white dots. The inscription at lower center of <em>The Submersion</em> describes the Israelites\u2019 persecution under the Egyptian pharaoh and his army\u2019s fate when they followed Moses into the Red Sea. The publisher opportunistically refers to the \u201cgreat and immortal hand\u201d of Titian in this legend, though the artist was still very much alive.</p>\n",
