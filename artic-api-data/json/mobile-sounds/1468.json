    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This charming expressive sandstone sculpture shows two lively monkeys, a mother and her young child.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: This sculpture is very simple image of a simian mother and child. But the affectionate bond between the mother and the child is particularly powerful. From the materials it is quite clear that this sculpture comes from Indonesia possibly from Eastern Java around the thirteenth century.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: It\u2019s difficult to be certain in what context the sculpture would be seen but most likely it would have been placed in the vicinity of a temple. You\u2019ll notice the sculpture was made to be viewed in the round, so it likely would have sat on some sort of pedestal rather than adorning a wall. We can\u2019t know if this humble carving was made for a Hindu or a Buddhist temple because at that time in Indonesia both religions flourished.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE:  It is the very ordinariness of the sculpture that seems to attract people and makes this monkey holding its child one of the most popular images in our galleries.</p>\n",
