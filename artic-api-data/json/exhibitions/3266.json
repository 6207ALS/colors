    "short_description": "For more than a decade, architect J\u00fcrgen Mayer H. has been collecting envelopes lined with patterns and codes designed to keep the contents private. Used by institutions to ensure that passwords and PINs sent in letters are only seen by the recipient, these data sheets are ubiquitous but largely overlooked. Nonetheless, they form a part of everyday life in a society that is increasingly fearful of identity theft and conscious of the need for data security.",
