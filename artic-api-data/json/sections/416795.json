None of these are signed or dated, although all but this one bear an estate stamp resembling a signature. None were exhibited or sold during the artist\u2019s lifetime, and, until the Art Institute\u2019s purchase in 1999, all remained in the family collection (see Provenance and Exhibition History). Some critics, like Joris-Karl Huysmans, made special note of Caillebotte\u2019s still-life paintings, yet they were less known than his cityscapes and interior views. And still lifes with a focus solely on raw meat are rarer still, with few narrative clues to help the viewer understand these jarring but exquisitely painted cuts of meat.\n\nThese paintings are thought to have been conceived after the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882, where Caillebotte showed paintings depicting modern life, and land and riverscapes at Trouville. The exhibition also included the startling still life Fruit Displayed on a Stand (fig. 3.4 [Berhaut 1978, no. 178; Berhaut 1994, no. 193]). Huysmans described the scene as \u201cextraordinary . . . this is conveyed with strict truthfulness, an absolute fidelity of tone.\u201d This veristic slice of life was unprecedented not only in Caillebotte\u2019s oeuvre, but also within the genre in general, causing Huysmans to further observe, \u201cThis is still life freed from its routine.\u201d In addition to its originality, this commissioned work was both decorative and appealing, whereas the meat paintings were radically disconcerting and uncommercial, focusing on a subject for experimentation rather than exhibition or sale.\n\nIn Fruit Displayed on a Stand, Caillebotte focused not only on the precisely arranged fruits, but also on how they were staged in \u201cwhite paper beds\u201d (as Huysmans described them) by an upscale shopkeeper for the delectation of the viewer-consumer. Likewise, in the two largest paintings of meat, Calf in a Butcher\u2019s Shop and Display of Chickens and Game Birds, the artist presents the way in which meat was displayed commercially, between the slaughterhouse and the bourgeois table. Within the still-life pictures that depict meat of various kinds, Caillebotte distinguishes among different types of vendors: between those that sold poultry and game that was in season (volaillers) (fig. 3.3); boucheries, which generally only sold the best cuts of beef, veal, and lamb (fig. 3.2); those specializing in the sale of pork (charcuterie); and those that sold offal (tripiers), such as the head and tongue depicted in the Art Institute\u2019s painting.\n\nElegantly arranged and hygienically presented, Caillebotte\u2019s depictions of beef on or above the counter have little to do with the descriptions of the wholesale markets of Les Halles, which contemporary novelist \u00c9mile Zola saw as crammed, hectic, and covered in a visceral mess. As with his paintings of Parisians on display, who are \u201cconsuming\u201d the recently developed streets of Haussmann\u2019s Paris near the Caillebotte family home in the eighth arrondissement (see cat. 2), the artist is here showing the reality of his upper-crust world, devoted to the consumption of luxury goods, which at that time included meat.\n\nOf the four paintings showing meat, Calf in a Butcher\u2019s Shop (fig. 3.2) is the most elaborate, showing the calf carcass on display against a curtain and decorative wall, itself a symbol of the new means of display employed in the city\u2019s wealthier neighborhoods. Trussed and garnished, the carcass is, as Douglas Druick pointed out, \u201covertly\u2014and disturbingly\u2014feminized, bedecked with flowers placed as if to both suggest an alluring d\u00e9colletage and create a decorative border for its gaping interior.\u201d Caillebotte scholar Michael Marrinan makes a distinction between the Art Institute\u2019s painting and the artist\u2019s depictions of meat in canvases such as Calf in a Butcher\u2019s Shop (fig. 3.2), showing a store that could have been located in the neighborhood of the boulevard Haussmann, where the artist and his brother had moved in 1879. By contrast, the Art Institute painting shows the interior of a tripier, a merchant whose wares were not allowed to be sold by butchers and vendors of higher-cut meats. Marrinan suggests that the boldness of Caillebotte\u2019s composition and palette comes from his discovery of and fascination with abats, or offal, sold in a neighborhood of very different socioeconomic status.\n\nIn the Art Institute\u2019s still life, Caillebotte sets the highly provocative and startling pairing of an ox tongue and calf\u2019s head against the same grayish-blue background as that in the diminutive Rib of Beef (fig. 3.1). Cleaned up, purified, and processed\u2014with skin, hair, and fur removed\u2014in both pictures the meat appears in a pristine and pleasing locale that belies its probable commercial setting. Marrinan has noted that Caillebotte depicts the calf\u2019s head seen in the Art Institute\u2019s picture after it has been blanched, rather than freshly butchered, which explains the absence of gore and its eerily pastel pinkish-white color. Despite these plausible explanations for the somewhat antiseptic way the meat is presented, the subject jars, first because it shows a head, rather than a fragment or cut of meat, and secondly because of the way it is treated by the artist. With eyelids closed, the calf\u2019s head does not appear to be in agony; indeed, it seems not to be dead but rather in a dreamlike state. This calm submission, as if it might be sitting for a portrait, can be likened to the pig\u2019s head \u201cposing\u201d for the painter in Thomas Couture\u2019s 1865 parody of the realist artist at work, La peinture r\u00e9aliste (fig. 3.5).\n\nThe jarring effect of the picture\u2019s subject is heightened by the contrast between, on the one hand, the artist\u2019s very plausible and practical \u201crealist\u201d representation of his subject and, on the other, the ease with which the unlikely pair seen in the Art Institute\u2019s still life takes on quite different connotations. It is not difficult to see the softly curved volumetric shape of the calf\u2019s head as existing in dialogue with the extracted tongue of the ox: its feminine form, whose gentle palette suggests soft flesh, in opposition to a fiery, muscular, elongated member that bears an irresistible resemblance to a penis. The grotesque quality of the ox tongue is mitigated by its extreme vulnerability, and, unlike the calf\u2019s head, it appears exposed and fragile. Although we cannot know the extent to which Caillebotte was aware of this reading, in these never-exhibited canvases he was surely testing out a new subject for paintings of modern life.\n\nBy insisting on an overall bluish-lavender palette for the meat, and on a radical framing and cropping of his composition, Caillebotte further subverted the realism of seventeenth-century Dutch masters (see, for example, fig. 3.6) and the realism of contemporaries like Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin and Th\u00e9odule Ribot (fig. 3.7, fig. 3.8, and fig. 3.9), who both specialized in kitchen and market scenes. Despite the distancing from traditional realism that his palette implies, Caillebotte\u2019s choices of meat are no less raw and visceral, and his renderings of his subjects are no less realist with respect to his anatomical observations. Caillebotte\u2019s depiction of the tongue in the Art Institute painting, for example, when compared to diagrams of actual bovine anatomy, proves to be surprisingly precise. He accurately described from top to bottom the root and epiglottal area inside the throat, the bulging bend that gives it a knee-like quality, and the body of the tongue down to the red tip, which the artist painted a darker red as if rendering pooling blood. Consequently, Caillebotte\u2019s treatment of the meat is both startlingly realistic and somewhat tempered by his preference for a pewter-blue backdrop. This treatment of his subject then can be seen to distance Caillebotte from the more traditional realism of his time, while in some way presaging the provocatively direct depictions of meat by twentieth-century artists\u2014such as Chaim Soutine\u2019s Carcass of Beef (fig. 3.10), Francis Bacon\u2019s beef carcasses, and Lucian Freud\u2019s fleshy nudes\u2014who distanced the rawness of the subject by drawing attention instead to their bravura handling of paint and color.\n\nThis odd pairing of calf\u2019s head and ox tongue then invites us to consider many interpretations of Caillebotte\u2019s \u201crealism.\u201d Is this his bourgeois response to the slaughter, filth, and blood associated with the abattoirs of La Villette? Or is it, as Paula Young Lee has posited, a sly wink at consumption in both a gustatory and sexual sense, gesturing to the female veau (which in the nineteenth century was also a slang word for young prostitute) and the phallic male tongue? Or, as Marrinan believes, is it like all of Caillebotte\u2019s still lifes, a testament to his engagement with a new territory, not, as in Monet\u2019s case for monetary (easily accessible for sale) reasons, but for the purpose of artistic innovation and as an expression of his persistent penchant for arranging observed objects, be they people on the streets or fruits in a stall, throughout his career.\n\nAlthough there are no known preparatory drawings or sketchbook pages related to the Art Institute\u2019s composition, a transmitted-infrared image of the painting (fig. 3.11) suggests that Caillebotte drew in the forms broadly and made few changes to the original composition. Among these were the addition of a second calf\u2019s head (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report) and a slight shifting of the principal head to a more frontal position; the previous placement of the head would have revealed more of the gaping neck, which, if the animal had not been blanched, would have included a bloody gash. This area is like the rest of the composition, painted thinly and touched on lightly, almost decoratively. Equally incongruous is the artist\u2019s treatment of the ear in the background. Although there is no evidence to show changes, it seems oddly shaped, trumpet- rather than petal-shaped like the foreground ear, with less of the latter\u2019s delicate luminosity (fig. 3.12). The third ear and partial crown of the unseen calf\u2019s head at far right seems to be a late addition and the major change to the original composition (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). It also reminds us of Caillebotte\u2019s interest in photography: his cropping and close-up framing creates a tension that counters the traditional expectations for still lifes (which are generally accessible and literal), and alerts us to the surface patterns and the compositional decisions he is making in the name of a decorative harmony and effect. For Michael Fried the tension sensed in Calf\u2019s Head and Ox Tongue\u2014which for him arises from the contrast between the \u201cbrutely corporeal subject matter\u201d and the artist\u2019s highly refined technique\u2014was intentional and demonstrates a continuing dichotomy between the artist\u2019s choice of subject matter and decorative execution.\n\nLike so many of Caillebotte\u2019s more provocative works, including his Man at the Tub (1884; Josefowitz Collection, Lausanne [Berhaut 1978, no. 267; Berhaut 1994, no. 286]) and Nude on a Couch (1882; Minneapolis Institute of Arts [Berhaut 1978, no. 184; Berhaut 1994, no. 201]), his meat series serves up a contradiction between bourgeois propriety and Zolaesque subject, between the thing depicted and the way in which it is painted in the service of both realism and decorative unity. In Calf\u2019s Head and Ox Tongue, he carried these contradictions to an extreme, conceiving an anthropomorphically suggestive yet graceful, decorative yet ambiguous image of offal that is imbued with multiple meanings, each of which is at the same time subverted by other meanings or aspects of the image. It is the painting\u2019s unsettling ambiguity that makes it so modern.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Caillebotte began this composition on a vertically oriented standard-size, no. 20 (paysage) landscape canvas with a gray-beige commercial preparation and the imprint of the color merchant Dubus on the verso. Starting with a sketch in charcoal or black chalk, the artist laid out his composition and largely painted within the existing sketch. Changes in the composition include the placement of the butcher\u2019s rail and its associated hooks at the bottom of the composition, the addition of the second calf\u2019s head at the far right, and possible changes to the position of the fully visible calf\u2019s head. The tonality of the background in the lower half of the painting was also modified from a cool, pale blue to warmer pinks and yellows. The artist varied the consistency and application of the paint to achieve a variety of textures ranging from smoothly blended to successive layers of impasto to wet-in-wet strokes with multiple colors on the brush at one time. The canvas is unlined and retains its original stretching; the painting is currently varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 3.13).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were probably very close to the current dimensions (73 \u00d7 54.1 cm). This closely corresponds to a no. 20 landscape (paysage) standard size (73 \u00d7 54 cm), turned vertically.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 19.3V (0.7) \u00d7 22.0H (0.4) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas shows light cusping on all sides corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. The warp-angle map (fig. 3.14) indicates that the bottom edge has very strong primary cusping associated with large-scale commercial canvas preparation. Although the canvas was not trimmed flush with the verso of the stretcher, any evidence of an unprimed edge or selvedge was probably removed from this side before or just after stretching.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tacks are placed 4\u20138.5 cm apart. Additional, more modern tacks have been added between the original tacks.\n\nOriginal stretcher: The current stretcher appears to be original. It is a five-member keyable mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a horizontal crossbar (fig. 3.15). Depth: 1.7 cm.\n\nStamp\n\nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: black stencil  \nContent: 60 Boul<sup>d</sup> M[alesherbe]s Paris / DUBUS / COU[LEU]RS FINES &amp; TOILES A PEINDRE / [RE]NT[OILA]GE [&amp; R]ESTA[URATION] (fig. 3.16)\n\nCross-sectional analysis indicates a thin brownish layer of material between the canvas and ground that closely follows the canvas texture. This material is organic, based on its characteristic bluish fluorescence in ultraviolet light, and estimated to be glue (fig. 3.17).\n\nThe ground is a double-layer, commercial preparation that extends to the edges of the tacking margins; it appears somewhat dry and smooth in stereomicroscopic examination. The lower layer primarily fills the deepest interstices in the weave and is extremely thin along the thread tops, while the upper layer moderately fills the weave. The priming is intermittently visible along the edges of forms but was largely covered by subsequent paint layers (fig. 3.18).\n\nThe preparation is a cool gray-beige with large black and yellow particles visible in both stereomicroscopic and cross-sectional examination (fig. 3.19). The natural warmth of the ground, due to the presence of translucent materials and pigments such as iron oxide yellow in conjunction with the aging medium, combines with the darker pigment particles such that it has an almost greenish cast in certain lighting conditions (fig. 3.20).\n\nThe lower layer of the ground is largely translucent and may contain a high proportion of calcium compounds such as chalk. The upper layer of the ground is predominantly lead white with traces of iron oxide earth pigments, barium sulfate, and calcium compounds. The binder of both layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination indicates Caillebotte outlined at least the major forms in dry media before beginning to paint. Since much of this media was subsequently swept up into the paint, the full extent of the underdrawing is uncertain.\n\nDry media trapped under islands of paint along the edges of forms suggests the artist used charcoal or black chalk to execute the underdrawing (fig. 3.21).\n\nThere are no obvious changes to the painting in the drawing stage; however, as much of the underdrawing is either not visible or has been swept up in subsequent paint layers, the possibility of changes in this stage cannot be excluded (see Paint Layer).\n\nThe painting was executed in a limited number of wet-in-wet campaigns, often with a wide variety of colors present within a small section of the work (fig. 3.22 and fig. 3.23); the underlayers appear to have been left to dry between campaigns. The composition was largely drawn before it was painted, but small details such as the meat hooks were added on top of the finished background paint. Finally, the second calf\u2019s head peeking in from the right edge also appears to be a late addition: blue background paint is visible amid skips in the paint layers associated with this second head (fig. 3.24).\n\nThe radio-transparent edges visible around the ox tongue and calf\u2019s head indicate that the artist drew his composition and largely painted within the drawn lines. While it is unclear whether he began with the background, leaving the still life in reserve, or with small touches of bright color to lightly indicate the objects, Caillebotte seems to have moved back and forth between the still life and background throughout the work\u2019s execution. The initial layers of the background, still largely visible in the top third of the composition, were thin, opaque colors applied with a stiff-bristle brush. The vigorous working of the surface\u2014Caillebotte pressed the brush into the surface hard enough that bristles fell out and became embedded in the paint\u2014combined with superimposed brushstrokes in different directions, and the marks left as the artist quickly lifted the brush from the surface, attest to its rapid execution (fig. 3.25). In much of the upper half of the background, the ground layer is visible amid skips and through the translucent areas where bristles scraped against the surface. In the middle and lower sections of the painting, the background is much more opaque and creamy, and appears to have been painted more than once. In the middle areas of the painting, the most opaque areas are adjacent to apparent adjustments to the outlines of the ox tongue and two calf\u2019s heads, and smooth out the object-ground transitions. This is especially evident in the space between the two calf\u2019s heads at right (fig. 3.26). Caillebotte varies the nature of his object-ground transition throughout the work, using a soft transition for much of the calf\u2019s head (fig. 3.27), or adding a darker stroke of color to accentuate the border for much of the ox tongue (fig. 3.28). With the latter, the slight bleed of red lake into the background paint along the edges of the ox tongue suggests Caillebotte stopped short of creating a hard line around his object; the additional background was added while the deep red lake of the ox tongue was still very wet (fig. 3.29). The repainting of the lower third of the composition may have had more than one purpose: to cover compositional changes and to change the tonality of the background. Originally, the artist painted much cooler tones throughout the lower half so that the overall background transitioned from a darker, grayer blue to paler blue rather than the warm pinks, peaches, and yellows now visible (fig. 3.30).\n\nAside from the addition of the protruding ear and crown from a second calf\u2019s head at the far right, changes to the composition appear relatively minor. The infrared and X-ray images suggest the butcher\u2019s rail was repositioned, perhaps more than once. In the X-ray, the rail appears lower, while the infrared suggests it was once higher; it cannot be excluded that at least one of these changes was simply to narrow the rail rather than reposition it. The faintness of these features in both images suggests they were short-lived considerations. The location of the hooks along the rail was also modified, and the position of the second hook from the left was moved further to the left to accommodate the calf\u2019s ear. The dark paint of the hooks was added wet-in-wet into the still-wet paint of the rail; the X-ray clearly shows the displacement of the rail paint by the application of the hooks (fig. 3.31). The angle of the hooks themselves appears to have been modified slightly, and traction cracks on the tips of the hooks suggests that the rail and the bases of the hooks were still soft when these features were added. Close examination of the long, linked, adjustable hook just to the left of center on the rail suggests that Caillebotte first indicated the connection between the fixed and adjustable hooks with a smaller link and simply added the larger structure around it, leaving the initial contours still visible (fig. 3.32).\n\nWhile the ox tongue seems to have retained its outline, with only minor adjustments to the edges, the main calf\u2019s head looks slightly different in many of the technical images. The X-ray and transmitted-infrared images suggest that Caillebotte added to the top of the animal\u2019s head (above the unseen eye) so that it originally appeared much flatter; additionally, the calf\u2019s snout was thinner. The transmitted and reflected infrared images also indicate changes to the animal\u2019s ears\u2014the left was larger and the right smaller. This, when combined with the flattened head, suggest the artist may have rotated the head slightly during the painting stages. A small damage is visible in the X-ray in the lower portion of the background; since the artist added opaque background paint to cover this loss, this damage probably occurred in the studio, possibly due to the removal of paint via scraping. In other areas, such as the calf\u2019s left ear, there appears to be evidence of wiping wet paint away (fig. 3.33). Just above this area, Caillebotte dug the back of the brush into the paint but subsequently painted over this feature. As all of these features are only visible in the X-ray, they hint at further, unknown changes to the lower paint layers.\n\nAs mentioned, the painting was largely executed wet-in-wet, and Caillebotte used a variety of brushes, paint consistencies, and blending techniques\u2014as well as a variety of strokes\u2014to add texture and depth to the work. The background, as mentioned, utilizes opaque paint of varying consistencies, a stiff-bristle brush, and multidirectional and crosshatching brushwork, resulting in a mottled appearance. The calf\u2019s head is largely blended with soft, fine brushes and directional strokes (fig. 3.34); toward the end of the process, the artist added touches of bright color such as the orange above the eyelid (fig. 3.35). The calf\u2019s ears and the inside of the neck are rendered in thicker, more pastel-like paint, with darker, more saturated colors and less blending (fig. 3.36). The edge of the calf\u2019s right ear has a strange comb-like texture, possibly caused by a scraping tool or a brush caked with dry paint (fig. 3.37). Each area of the ox tongue is handled individually, with short, directional, relatively unblended strokes and a fine brush for the tongue itself; here the artist often picked up two or more premixed colors onto his brush at one time. In the body of the tongue, the directional strokes are punctuated with short dashes from a brush with both blue and dark red paint (fig. 3.38), and an almost crusty impasto was employed for the orange and blue highlights near the back of the tongue (fig. 3.39). The root, back of the throat, and base of the skull are all painted very thickly with a wide variety of saturated colors. In several areas, the bright reds and deep reds near the edges of these forms were augmented and applied over the background (fig. 3.40). In some areas, the increased blending with each stroke of a new color cutting into the still-wet color beneath is readily visible (fig. 3.41). In others, the variety of colors present in a single stroke is clearly apparent (fig. 3.42). In many areas, there is a textural contrast between paint applied over dry strokes, where it catches and reinforces only the high points of the underlying texture, and wet-in-wet applications where paint of varying consistency is set into, cut into, and swept across still-wet paint. No matter the type of application, in many areas, the brightest strokes appear to be the final touches (fig. 3.43).\n\nPrimarily fine flat- and round-ferrule brushes with strokes up to 0.6 cm wide throughout the ox tongue, calf\u2019s head, and butcher\u2019s rail; isolated areas of wider strokes, up to 1 cm wide, in the background.\n\nXRF analysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, iron oxide yellow and/or red, vermilion, emerald green, chromium-containing pigments such as viridian, and cobalt blue.\n\nUV examination suggests the presence of fluorescing red lake in several areas of the painting, including the fleshy protrusions on either side of the ox tongue (associated with the root of the tongue and the base of the throat), based on the observation of characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence (fig. 3.44). Visual examination suggests there is a second, non-fluorescing red lake in other areas, such as the tip of the tongue and throughout the pale pinks of both the tongue and the calf\u2019s head.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an overall synthetic varnish that is not original to the painting. The lack of discolored natural-resin varnish in the depressions of the paint layer or evidence of previous cleaning, such as solvent penetration through the cracks to the canvas verso, suggests the painting was originally unvarnished.\n\nAdditional tacks were added along the tacking margins (between the original tacks), the keys were secured with paper tape, and the painting was lightly varnished in an undocumented treatment prior to acquisition. UV and stereomicroscopic examination suggest there was no retouching associated with this treatment.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition, unlined, and varnished. It is planar and retains its original stretcher and original stretching; additional tacks have been added between the original tacks for supplemental support. The corners of the stretcher are slightly out of alignment\u2014the ends of the vertical members are proud of the horizontal members at all four corners; these are areas of additional stress, abrasion, wear, and minor tearing. There are dark rubs and some abrasion from the frame rebate around the perimeter. As noted elsewhere (see Paint Layer), a small damage visible in the X-ray appears to have occurred in the artist\u2019s studio and was painted out with additional background paint. There is mild cracking through areas of impasto, localized wrinkling and drying crackle, a stretcher-bar crack on the right side, and a scratch in the upper left corner. There are localized accretions and brush inclusions throughout. There is no apparent retouching and there are no major losses.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1999): The current frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, nineteenth-century, plain molding scotia frame. The frame has water gilding over red bole. The outer treacle and inner fillet are burnished; the scotia and ogee sight molding have matte gilding. The frame retains its original gilding and glue sizing. The sides have been painted with buff-colored casein paint. The pine molding is mitered and joined with angled, sliding, dovetailed splines and has an independent half-lapped back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is scotia side; treacle molding ended high by a fillet on the outside edge; fillet; scotia; astragal; fillet; and ogee sight edge (fig. 3.45).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1994, removed by 1999): The painting was previously housed in what appears to be a Louis XIII convex frame with stylized acanthus-leaf ornament. The frame had water gilding with a burnished hollow and ornament.

I am grateful to Dr. Marrinan for pointing out that butcher shops would not have been allowed to have plate glass in the 1880s; see Michael Marrinan to Gloria Groom, Apr. 26, 2015, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDouglas Druick, \u201cStill Lifes,\u201d in Anne Distel, Douglas Druick, Gloria Groom, Rodolphe Rapetti, with Julia Sagraves and an essay by Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte: Urban Impressionist, exh. cat.

(Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), p. 316.\n\nSee Michael Marrinan, \u201cCommerce,\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte: A Painter in Paris, 1872\u20131887 (Getty Research Institiute, forthcoming): \u201cWhen Caillebotte ventures into the world of abats and triperies, he leaves behind a familiar world of the upper bourgeoisie to enter the land of low-cost meats and vulgar tastes. The shock and surprise\u2014perhaps even delight\u2014he finds there is registered in the picture as an overly vivid, gripping hallucination.\u201d My deepest thanks to Dr. Marrinan for providing me with an advance copy of this chapter.\n\nMichael Marrinan\u2019s extensive study of this painting notes that the contrasting white-and-red palette was aligned with the two types of material sold in a triperie: red (sold raw) and white (blanched before sale), explaining also the lack of \u201cgore\u201d in the calf\u2019s head.

Minsoo Kang and Amy Woodson-Boulton (Ashgate, 2008), p. 287: \u201cThe resemblance helps imbue the long, thin, flattened, slightly bent and pointed configuration of that red-tipped tongue with something of the grotesque, for it is dangling and impotent, challenging the viewer to view this most eloquent of organs as a mute and powerless object.\u201d See also Karin Sagner, \u201cGustave Caillebotte: An Impressionist and Photography,\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte: An Impressionist and Photography, ed.

Dr. McGwin was able to confirm the veracity of Caillebotte\u2019s depiction of an ox tongue.\n\nMy thanks to Dr. Julie A. McGwin, Veterinarian Specialist Senior/Program Manager, Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, for her expertise and assistance. Dr. McGwin further identified the shield-like shape above the tongue, into which the hook was inserted, as being formed by the stylohyoid bone. See Julie A.

Habel, Bovine Anatomy (Schl\u00fctersche, 2003), pp. 44\u201346.\n\nIn addition to the meat pictures, Caillebotte employed a silvery-blue backdrop in several portraits completed around this time. See, for example, Int\u00e9rieur, femme lisant (1880 [Berhaut 1978, no. 127; Berhaut 1994, no. 139]) and La femme \u00e0 la rose (1884 [Berhaut 1978, no. 262; Berhaut 1994, no. 287]). See also other still-life compositions from this period, such as Yellow Roses in a Vase (1882 [Berhaut 1978, no. 206; Berhaut 1994, no. 240]), which depicts a vase of flowers placed on a marbled blue-gray surface very similar to that seen in Rib of Beef (fig. 3.1).\n\nSee Stephen F. Eisenman, The Cry of Nature: Art and the Making of Animal Rights (Reaktion, 2013), pp. 171\u201372. La Villette, also known as the \u201cCity of Blood,\u201d was a centralized complex of slaughterhouses that opened in 1867 and was located \u201cfar from the other Paris of new grand boulevards and gilded facades, where the fashionable Parisian bourgeoisie passed their days and nights.\u201d See Kyri Claflin, \u201cLa Villette: City of Blood (1867\u20131914),\u201d in Meat, Modernity, and the Rise of the Slaughterhouse, ed. Paula Young Lee (University of New Hampshire Press/University Press of New England, 2008), p. 29.\n\nLee proposes that Caillebotte would have known of the alternate meanings for the word veau and that his four works of meat on display provide a veiled but knowing comment on the parallels between the marketplace (for meat produce) and the market for purchasable sex. See Paula Young Lee, \u201cStripped: Gustave Caillebotte and the Carcass of Modern Life,\u201d in Visions of the Industrial Age, 1830\u20131914: Modernity and the Anxiety of Representation in Europe, ed. Minsoo Kang and Amy Woodson-Boulton (Ashgate, 2008), pp. 278, 287\u201388.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination revealed small clusters of dark underdrawing material, possibly charcoal, trapped under islands of paint. See Compositional Planning in the Technical Report.\n\nMichael Fried, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Impressionism,\u201d Representations 66 (Spring 1999), pp. 34\u201336.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper-right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper-left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1999\\_561\\_Caill\\_calfs\\_head\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 19, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

This stamp for the color merchant Dubus was also found on four paintings by Caillebotte in the Wallraf-Richartz collection: The Plain of Gennevilliers, Yellow Fields (1884), Hills at Colombes (1890), Branch of the Seine, Autumn Atmosphere (1890), and Regatta at Argenteuil (1893).

XRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of mordant, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lake, including its fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.
