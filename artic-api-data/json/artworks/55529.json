    "description": "<p>In late 1921 the American Dada painter and photographer Man Ray produced his first photograms\u2014photographs made without a camera by placing objects on a sheet of light-sensitive paper, then exposing the arrangement to light. He claimed to have stumbled upon the process, which he dubbed \u201cRayographs,\u201d by chance; it turned out to be an appropriate method for an artist who looked to accidental and automatic occurrences for inspiration. With unexpected combinations of everyday objects, Rayographs articulated a key Dada interest in homemade, \u201canti-art\u201d reworkings of industrial and consumer society. Man Ray frequently used translucent items like glass bottles, filmstrips, and feathers, valuing their gradation of tones and illusion of three-dimensionality. \u201cThey looked startlingly new and mysterious,\u201d he later wrote. With these cameraless images, photography straddled the line between abstraction and representation. Dada leader Tristan Tzara called them \u201cpure Dada creations.\u201d</p>\n",
