    "description": "<p>This court sword, with its heavily gilded silver hilt, mother-of-pearl grip and gold inlayed blade, was intended for presentation to a diplomatic, civic, or military leader for ceremonial wear at court. It represents the final development of the eighteenth civilian smallsword, with its characteristic short blade and downturned kidney-shaped guard\u2014design features meant to make it less inhibiting to wear or less damaging to fine silk clothing.</p>\n<p>The reverse side of the guard is engraved with the name and address of Napoleon Bonaparte\u2019s official goldsmith, Martin-Guillaume Biennais of Paris. Biennais was responsible for executing <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25167/soup-tureen\">gold and silver table wear</a>, furniture, and even weapons for the Emperor and his court, much of which was designed by the architect Charles Percier. Watercolor drawings attributed to Percier for a nearly-identical hilt design\u2014complete with flanking winged horses, laurel leaves, and other classical ornaments\u2014are preserved in the Mus\u00e9e des Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris. These motifs reference the trappings of the ancient Roman empire to draw allusions to Napoleon and his rule.</p>\n",
