Robinson, 1949.414\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Colorless with a yellow-green tinge and opaque brick-red glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rim, rounded by reheating, flares out to form a funnel-shaped mouth on a cylindrical neck that spreads out and down into an ovoid body with a flattened bottom and slightly kicked base. There is no pontil mark. The rim, neck, and shoulder are decorated with a fine brick-red trail that is wound nine times under the rim. A second, slightly thicker trail is applied in a large blob at the base of the neck and wound down the shoulder onto the body, where the lower three trails were dragged down seven times, creating a feather pattern as the vessel wall was nipped or pinched to create a series of horizontal decorations. For a zoomable image, see fig. 136.1.\n\nThe bottle is intact; the rim and area around the trail decoration preserves a silvery, thick, iridescent weathering crust that either has fallen away or has been removed from the rest of the vessel.\n\nThe rim, the style of trail decoration, and the tooling or pinching on this vessel would suggest a Syro-Palestinian glass of the fourth or fifth century were it not for the brick-red trail decoration that is usually associated with later Byzantine and early Islamic glasses. If the trails were applied in transparent aquamarine or deep-blue glass, the vessel might be associated with those manufactured at the site of Jalame in Israel. However, the flattened bottom also suggests a somewhat later date.\n\nThere is a bottle blown of similar glass in the Princeton University Art Museum, with a series of pinched decoration repeated eight times and a single trail below the rim. The profile of the Princeton bottle is close to this vessel, but there is no contrasting trail decoration and the angles at the base and between the rim and neck are not transitioned as well; the Princeton bottle is dated to the sixth or seventh century.\n\nThere are few other parallels or related glasses, but one bottle in the Corning Museum of Glass is particularly interesting, as it is a shape also typical of a fourth- or fifth-century vessel from the Syro-Palestinian coast. It too has brick-red trails applied and tooled in a festooned pattern on the body, which was reheated and further inflated. There is a related bottle, unpublished, in the collection of the San Antonio Museum of Art. The contrasting opaque red or dark-reddish-brown trail was also used to decorate later Gallo-Roman and Frankish glass. A footed beaker, formerly in a French private collection, has opaque brown trails that are tooled downward as in this bottle but without the additional pinched decoration.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Weinberg and Goldstein, \u201cGlass Vessels,\u201d pp. 64\u201367, for jugs and bottles with trail decoration; pp. 82\u201384, for pinched decoration and especially a complete bottle illustrated as a parallel in the Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri\u2013Columbia, acc. no. 68.157, acquired in Jerusalem.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, pp. 156\u201357, no. 222.\n\nWhitehouse, Roman Glass 2, p. 213, no. 778.\n\nH\u00f4tel Drouot, Verres antiques, lot 513.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 136 Bottle, late 5th/late 6th century A.D.\n\nfig. 136.1 Bottle (late 5th/late 6th century A.D.).
