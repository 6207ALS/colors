Drawing upon his experience in jazz, rock, hardcore punk, classical, and klezmer, as well as film, cartoon, popular, and improvised music, he has created an influential body of experimental work that incorporates a range of styles and compositional formats. His experimental works in rock and jazz with bands such as Naked City, Painkiller, and Masada have earned him a cult following, and his music has been performed worldwide by rock bands, improvisers, jazz musicians, and classical ensembles alike. Zorn established the Tzadik label in 1995, opened the Stone performance space in 2005, and has published and edited five volumes of musicians' writings under the title Arcana. He is the recipient of commissions from the Kronos Quartet, the New York Philharmonic, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble, and pianist Stephen Drury, among others. In addition to a MacArthur fellowship, Zorn has been awarded the William Schuman Award for composition from Columbia University and the Cultural Achievement Award from the Foundation for Jewish Culture.</p><p>Visitors who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to email <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
