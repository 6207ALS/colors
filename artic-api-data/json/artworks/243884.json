The drawings, a series of images that capture precise military maneuvers and show the appropriate tackle for each type of soldier, were then engraved for publication.</p>\n<p>For A Soldier Loading a Musket, de Gheyn drew the figure clearly and confidently with thin brown lines, adding gray wash to suggest volume and texture. This clarity was necessary for the engraver who would copy it onto a copper plate. In the printed version, a command instructed the soldier to ram powder into their musket.</p>\n",
