In mid-August 1894 Whistler paused in the small place Furstenburg to make this experimental drawing, using a thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that he had obtained from Lemercier (see cat. 95 and cat. 96). Although in his correspondence of 1894 Whistler repeatedly referred to papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal as \u201cnew,\u201d he had in fact learned about a similar paper from Fantin-Latour by 1892, when he used it for the small image of Charlotte Williams (cat. 58) and for the two portraits of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 59 and cat. 60). Whistler had also employed a commercially manufactured transparent transfer paper to create the separate stones for the color lithographs he produced with the printer Belfond in 1891\u201393 (cat. 45, cat. 46, cat. 55, cat. 56, cat. 66, and cat. 67), as well as for a number of untransferred drawings (cat. 47 and cat. 57; dwg. II, dwg. III, dwg. V, and dwg. VI).\n\nWhen Whistler sent Rue Furstenburg to the Ways in London on August 14, he expressed the enthusiastic hope that the smooth papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal would \u201clead to many things!\u201d (letter 104). A few days later, eager to hear about the printers\u2019 progress with the new paper, he asked if once transferred to stone the image had retained \u201cthe sweet velvety quality\u201d that he felt he had obtained while drawing it (letter 106). Rue Furstenburg does indeed differ from the artist\u2019s lithographs drawn on papier viennois during the preceding weeks (cat. 86, cat. 87, cat. 88, cat. 89, cat. 90, cat. 91, cat. 92, cat. 93, and cat. 94). It is free from the pronounced mechanical grain imposed by the papier viennois, and with its soft lines and rich blacks it resembles a charcoal or chalk drawing. Whistler was pleased with the first proofs he received, finding them \u201cbrighter\u201d and richer than anticipated and attributing their \u201cinequalities\u201d to defects in the particular sheet of transfer paper (letter 107). He hoped to get even better results with future drawings, for which he intended to use a papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal more carefully prepared especially for him by Lemercier. He suggested that these drawings be transferred to grained stones in order to achieve the surface quality he desired.\n\nWhistler referred repeatedly to his pleasure in this small street scene, calling it a \u201cgreat favorite\u201d (letter 116). There was some delay before the twenty-five impressions he requested were printed, due to a shortage of appropriate papers; nevertheless, the Ways completed the order by 13 September 1894 (letter 117).\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (324 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 202 mm), signed; Palmer, golden-yellow Japanese paper (303 \u00d7 163 mm).
