    "description": "<p>Daniel Garber was one of the leaders of a group of American painters working in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who found ample inspiration in nature. <em>Hills of Byram</em> was executed in March 1909 in Point Pleasant, overlooking the river and the distant quarry on the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Bare trees, dead grasses, and the pale sky evoke a crisp spring day, freely painted with a flickering yet controlled touch. Although Garber\u2019s painting appears impressionistic, he prized form and structure, and carefully planned his compositions. He spent months observing the land in different conditions and making studies before embarking upon the final picture in the studio.</p>\n",
