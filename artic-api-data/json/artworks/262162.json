    "description": "<p>Sketchbooks, architectural drawings, photographic material, printed matter, and correspondence related to the career of Chicago architect, C. William Brubaker of Perkins &amp; Will. Charles William \u201cBill\u201d Brubaker was born September 28, 1926 in South Bend, Indiana. After several years in the United States Navy, Brubaker completed his undergraduate education at the University of Texas at Austin, where he received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture in 1950. From 1947 to 1950, he spent summers in Chicago interning at the Perkins &amp; Will firm, after which he was hired permanently. Brubaker became partner at Perkins &amp; Will in 1958, served as President from 1968 to 1974, and retired in 1998. While Brubaker designed a number of commercial projects for Perkins &amp; Will, including the First National Bank of Chicago, he was best known for his school designs. He authored many works on the topic of both school design and urban planning and received numerous civic and professional awards. He was elected to the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects in 1968. Brubaker died in Evanston, Illinois in 2002.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Brubaker,%20C.%20William,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Brubaker,%20C.%20William,%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Brubaker,%20C.%20William/field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">C.
