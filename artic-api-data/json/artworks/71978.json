    "description": "<p><em>Reclining Nude</em> depicts Mathilde Q. Beckmann (known as Quappi), the artist\u2019s second wife and a talented singer and violinist. During his early career spent in Germany, Max Beckmann criticized the French avant-garde; by the mid-1920s, however, he began to identify with artists working in Paris, and by 1929 he was living, painting, and spending the majority of his time in the city. This painting of Quappi, nude and in a traditional artistic posture of repose, evokes similar compositions by Beckmann\u2019s contemporaries <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Henri+Matisse\">Henri Matisse</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Pablo+Picasso\">Pablo Picasso</a>.</p>\n",
