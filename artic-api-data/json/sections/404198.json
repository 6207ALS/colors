The presence of Belfond\u2019s blind stamp on both sheets (see also dgw. V and dwg. VI) relates the drawings definitively to the lithographs produced in 1891 with the French printer, as does the resemblance of the model\u2014known only as \u201cTootsie\u201d\u2014to the woman depicted in the color lithographs completed with Belfond, Nude Model, Back View (cat. 45) and Draped Figure, Standing (cat. 46). Although the composition of Draped Model Leaning on a Rail (dwg. III) may be compared to that of the 1894 lithograph Figure Study (cat. 113), both it and Nude Model Pulling Drapery over Her Head (dwg. II) almost certainly date from 1891, the lithograph representing a later return to a favorite theme.\n\nBelfond provided the artist with a type of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that was probably handmade in his shop by brushing one side of thin sheets of wove paper with a gum coating designed to receive lithographic crayon or ink. These two transfer drawings were mistakenly executed in lithographic crayon on the uncoated sides of the sheets and were therefore untransferable, although the signatures indicate that the artist considered them to be finished, and the registration marks on Nude Model Pulling Drapery over Her Head further suggest that it was a candidate for use as the keystone for a color lithograph. When Whistler recognized his error, he reinforced both drawings with black ink on the gum-coated sides of the sheets, perhaps hoping to use them as templates for future drawings on the transparent French transfer paper that he was using at this time for his experiments in color lithography.  \nBritt Salvensen, Harriet K. Stratis, Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The ink and the crayon are almost certainly on different sides of the paper, although the extreme thinness of the paper and the fact that the sheets are edge-mounted makes this difficult to confirm.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">II.
