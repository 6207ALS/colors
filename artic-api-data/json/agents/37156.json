    "description": "<p>Maria Helena Vieira da Silva left her hometown Lisbon in 1928 with the intention to study sculpture at the Acad\u00e9mie La Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Paris. Amid the vibrant Parisian art scene, her interests extended to painting, which she studied with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35363\" target=\"_blank\">Fernand L\u00e9ger</a>, among others. In the mid 1930s, Vieira da Silva began working in increasingly abstract modes. Yet abstraction was never Vieira da Silva\u2019s only concern\u2014even earlier in her life, her excitement with the speed of modern life led to an interest in the dynamic pictorial strategies of the Italian Futurists, but she also reacted strongly against those artists\u2019 alliance with Fascism.</p><p>In 1936, as right-wing extremists were gaining influence in Europe, Vieira da Silva actively debated the merits of abstraction and realism with fellow politically aware artists, particularly the artist\u2019s group Amis de Monde, which met in a Paris caf\u00e9. It was in this context that she painted <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53001/composition?q=composition+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Composition</em></a><em> (</em>1936\u20131937), a significant early abstraction that demonstrates her diverse visual interests. The colorful planes of the painting\u2019s central mass suggest checkered textiles as much as they do the artist\u2019s favored <em>azulejos</em>, decorative ceramic tiles common in Lisbon, which Vieira da Silva collected from periods as early as the fifteenth century. This painting anticipates later shifts in her work towards abstracted urban space and the stark verticals of modern architecture and engineering, such as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/53004/rotterdam?q=rotterdam+silva\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Rotterdam</em></a><em> </em>(1956).</p><p>When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, Vieira da Silva and her husband, the Hungarian-Jewish artist \u00c1rp\u00e1d Szenes, left Paris to move back to her native Lisbon. Because of her marriage to Szenes, the Portuguese government revoked Vieira da Silva\u2019s citizenship, and the couple moved once again, traveling on documents issued by the League of Nations to Rio de Janeiro. They would stay there seven years, becoming friends with important Brazilian modernist poets such as Murilo Mendes, receiving federal commissions, and exhibiting at the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes.</p><p>After Vieira da Silva returned to Paris in 1947, the French government purchased important works from this period such as <em>La partie d\u2019\u00e9checs</em> (The Chess Game), 1943, now in the collection of the Centre Pompidou, which demonstrate her ongoing negotiations of abstraction and figuration that would continue through the rest of her life. As she saw it, abstraction, politics, and the everyday were all part of the experience of life: \u201cEverything amazes me. I paint my amazement, which at the same time is delight, fear and laughter. I do not want to exclude anything from this amazement. I want to paint pictures with many things, with all the contradictions . . .\u201d</p>",
