    "description": "<p>Born in Chicago in 1907, Aaron Bohrod became a nationally known artist during his own lifetime. He studied at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1927 to 1929, and later traveled to New York to attend the Art Student\u2019s League. He was profoundly influenced by the artist John Sloan (1871\u20131951), who taught him the importance of the urban American landscape. This drawing of a crowded city street corner and market exemplifies Bohrod\u2019s mature style and demonstrates his relationship to Sloan and the Ashcan school, with its emphasis on American daily life.</p>\n",
