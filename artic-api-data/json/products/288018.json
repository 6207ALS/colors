    "description": "Colorful mosaics, playful flowing forms, imaginative facades\u2014Barcelona shines with the buildings of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. How did the son of a Catalan blacksmith become a world-famous architect? The first years of Gaud\u00ed's life were challenging. Because of an illness, young Gaud\u00ed couldn\u2019t attend school and was often alone. Many of his days were spent out in nature, which he would later call his great teacher. Even during his training as an architect in Barcelona, his teachers were puzzled, wondering: is he a \u201cgenius or a fool?\u201d Many considered his unusual ideas eccentric, sometimes even crazy. But Gaud\u00ed was simply ahead of his time. His buildings are now a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) World Heritage Site.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 x 11 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 40</li>\n<li><strong>Grades:</strong> P - 3</li>\n<li><strong>Ages:</strong> 4 - 8</li>\n</ul>",
