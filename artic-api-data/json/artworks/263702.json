    "description": "<p>This statuette depicts Venus, the Roman goddess of love, sexuality, and maternity, with her hair in an elegant updo and wearing nothing but the diadem (crown) atop her head. Earlier images of Venus often represented the goddess modestly clothed, reinforcing her role as exemplary matron and mother of the Roman people. By the first century, Venus was regularly shown fully nude, reflecting body types associated with her Greek counterpart, Aphrodite, whose domain leaned more toward the pleasures of erotic love and seduction. In their respective cultures, both goddesses served as models for brides and matrons: nude forms such as this guided women to cultivate their sexual appeal, thereby fostering the production of children who would carry on society</p>\n",
