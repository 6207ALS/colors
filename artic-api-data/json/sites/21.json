    "description": "Science, Art, and Technology began as a year-long course offered by The Art Institute of Chicago to Chicago Public School science teachers interested in exploring the relationship between science and art within a museum setting. Throughout the year art historians, museum educators, conservators, artists, and scientists spoke to teachers on wide-ranging topics, from the physics of light and color to careers in science, art, and technology. Teachers used the information provided to create written guides for museum visits with their students and lesson plans for in-class instruction. The program's overarching goal was to show science teachers that an art museum may be used as a visual library to augment and to enrich established high-school science curricula in chemistry, earth science, or physics. With primary emphasis on the theme of light and color, the sessions, conceptually integrated with Illinois State Goals and Chicago Academic Standards, revealed how the scientific method is applied to the making, conserving, and exhibiting of art. This Web site is designed for all teachers, who are invited to make use of its contents as points of departure for their own explorations with their students of science, art, or technology.",
