    "description": "<p>Produced over the course of 12 years, this portrait depicts Isabella Wolff, one of Sir Thomas Lawrence\u2019s most intimate friends, contemplating a printed image of the Delphic Sibyl from <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33808/michelangelo-buonarroti\">Michelangelo\u2019s</a> famous Sistine Chapel ceiling. Wolff\u2019s serpentine pose cleverly echoes another Sibyl from that same work. The Sibyls were priestesses of Classical legend who made enigmatic judgments and prophecies. They were often pictured according to Western fantasies of the Near East, hence Wolff\u2019s elaborate turban here. Lawrence was famed for his ability to evoke the surface effects and textures of clothing; that talent is on full display in Wolff\u2019s shimmering satin gown.</p>\n",
