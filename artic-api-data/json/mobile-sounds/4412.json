    "transcript": "<p>Costa Petridis: I think very often that masks are the representation of the other world, that they are temporary incarnations or embodiments of the non-visible realm of the spirits.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator Costa Petridis.</p>\n<p>Costa Petridis: So the object we're looking at is a helmet mask from the Kuba people. They live in Central Democratic Republic of the Congo, as it is called today. Now, when important members of the Kuba royal elite come to die, elaborate funerals are organized. And for those funerals, mask performances are taking place. And it is in the context of these funerary mask performances that a helmet mask like the one that we're looking at will appear, will be danced with. It's important to note that this is not a wooden sculpture. It is, in fact, a mask made out of a variety of other materials, most notably, woven fibers and then an animal hide. Specifically, the face of the mask is used as the spotted skin of a leopard. Other notable materials are the various glass beads and also, the white cowry shells. And all these materials have meaning and they underline-- underscore the value of the object as a reflection of the power, the prestige, the authority of the man that they are commemorating through their participation in the funeral.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n",
