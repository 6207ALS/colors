    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The fruits, vegetables and game birds in this still life are painted with an extraordinary intensity. Framed by a stone window, they are illuminated by a penetrating light that reveals every detail of their surface and texture. The utterly black background throws their forms into even sharper focus. Against this darkness, the objects are arranged with an elegant sense of geometry and rhythm. The birds are hung, a traditional way to store them after hunting, in a row from smallest to largest. Their grouped bodies form a triangle within the window frame which is matched by another created by the fruits and vegetables. Notice how the artist increases our sense of the objects' presence by trompe l'oeil or tricking the eye, making it seem as though some of them extend out into our space.</p>\n<p>The painting was made around 1600 by Juan Sanchez Cotan, who lived and worked in the City of Toledo in central Spain. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: He's an extraordinarily gifted painter of still life whose works are very rare. And there's a wonderful insight into him to be gained from remembering that he left his worldly work as a painter when he was in his early forties and went and joined a Carthusian monastery as a lay brother.</p>\n",
