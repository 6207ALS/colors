    "short_description": "As opposed to their Edo-period predecessors, many 20th-century printmakers had complete control over the entire process, from initial sketch to carving and finally on to printing. Therefore, any changes made during a print run\u2014such as altering color choice, texture, or modifying the subject\u2014were done almost entirely for aesthetic reasons alone. Such changes resulted in works that look similar but have different details, and often different moods. This exhibition brings together examples of prints from the same edition that display subtle alterations.",
