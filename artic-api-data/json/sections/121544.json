For example, the military composition in sheet 6A is elaborated in this folio, which displays Ensor\u2019s technique of assembling composite forms from a range of sources. The phalanx of soldiers with skeletal or camel heads holding rifles transforms into a carnival crowd. The soldiers\u2019 bony legs were inspired by scientific illustrations of dinosaur and bird skeletons (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). The largest soldier wears the tall helmet and uniform of the Belgian civil guard, but his legs are those of a bird. In front of him stands an even more hybrid being: a naked, horned hermaphrodite with chicken legs that resembles ethnographic depictions of tribal peoples in journals like La nature (see fig. 3). Armed with rifles, the soldiers battle an opposing crowd, in the midst of undulating larval forms that rise upward from folios 7A/B and 7C/D.\n\nBehind the soldiers, a squat figure resembles Louis Dollo, the paleontologist who supervised the excavation of the iguanodon dinosaurs at Bernissart and in 1882 became an assistant at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences (see fig. 4, fig. 5, and fig. 6). The man also looks like Ernest Rousseau, husband of Ensor\u2019s close friend Mariette Rousseau and a professor at the Free University of Brussels and the national military academy who specialized in physics and geometry, with a focus on the practical applications of science (see fig. 7).\n\nOn the right, a nude infant with large eyes and a hooked nose grasps another serpentine larval form that emerges from the adjacent folio (6D/E). The baby alludes to Hilarion, a manifestation of the Devil in Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony, who reappears fully grown at the bottom of the drawing, reaching under Anthony\u2019s robe (folios 8E/F and 8G/H). Ensor worked over earlier drawing along the right side; at lower right there appears to be an architectural structure of some sort under the current image. Similarly, the conical form at center that extends into the sheet above was developed over preexisting drawing and is thus perhaps a later addition. Historical restorations are preserved at the center, bottom center, upper right edge, and bottom right corner. A small artist\u2019s patch formerly covered the infant\u2019s genitals; this now appears lighter than the surrounding paper.
