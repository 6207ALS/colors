    "copy": " Finding aids are inventories or indices that describe the contents and context of an archival collection and are the primary method of accessing information about any given group of records. Users should note that, because some archival collections are very large, finding aids will not necessarily describe every item or object contained within. In other words, description may sometimes only be offered at a broader box, series, or folder level (e.g., \"letters, 1940\"). In order to ascertain the full and exact contents of a collection, it may be necessary to review the materials in person at the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries\u2019 Reading Room. Finding aids are text documents and do not contain images or other digital content. To access digitized objects from the Archives\u2019 collections, please visit our Images and Media database.
