He spent his first months there familiarizing himself with the landscape\u2014its topography, plants, and trees\u2014and the life of native inhabitants. By the end of 1891 and into 1892, he had embarked on a series of bust- and full-length oil paintings of some of his new acquaintances, both indigenous and of European descent (fig. 49.2 [possibly W 479] and fig. 49.3 [W 423]). He considered drawing to be the critical means by which to become \u201cused to the personality of each thing and each individual.\u201d Thus, at the same time that he was working on oil portraits, Gauguin produced a distinctive group of drawn \u201cportraits\u201d in charcoal and black chalk (fig. 49.16, fig. 49.18, fig. 49.19, fig. 49.21, fig. 49.23, fig. 49.24) in what most likely was a concentrated effort to grasp the character of young Tahitians, especially females (the series includes only one depiction of a man [cat. 45]). He was fascinated by the ability of the women to remain still and totally self-absorbed for hours, and many sketches and more finished drawings indicate his desire to penetrate their elusive character. Gauguin portrayed his subjects close-up, in frontal and three-quarter views, sometimes coupling these with a head in profile, as in the verso of the double-sided drawing in Chicago (fig. 49.1). Here the larger head, in a three-quarter pose, is strongly delineated and more sculptural in appearance than the fainter, more tentative, linear profile at the left.\n\nOne can find juxtaposed heads facing forward and sideways not only in earlier art (see fig. 49.4), but also in the fields of anthropology and ethnography (see fig. 49.5 and fig. 49.6), as well as in criminology (see fig. 49.7). The single visible eye of the head in profile on the recto of the sheet under discussion here looks down or is closed. The eye sockets of the forward-looking head are blank\u2014they lack pupils and irises\u2014suggesting ancient sculptures (in which details such as eyes, added in paint, normally have disappeared over the centuries) and creating a sense of mystery. A similar absence of eyes can be observed in a wood head the artist carved at the same time (fig. 49.8 [Gray 98]). An 1892 oil-on-canvas depiction of a Tahitian female resembles the image of the woman on the Chicago sheet\u2019s verso, except that in the painting Gauguin provided the model with fully defined eyes (fig. 49.9 [W 1964 448;]). While almost all of the subjects of the drawing series lack delineated eyes, Gauguin shaded the eye sockets in most to suggest the direction of the subjects\u2019 glances (see, for example, fig. 49.10 and fig. 49.19, fig. 49.21, fig. 49.23, and fig. 49.24 below).\n\nThe primary head on the recto is similar in appearance to a painted limestone Egyptian sculpture that has been in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, since 1826. A black-and-white photograph of the sculpture was available through the Paris agency Adolphe Giraudon (fig. 49.11), the same company which produced photographic reproductions of the Egyptian fresco that Gauguin took with him to Tahiti and considered, along with other visual materials, his \u201csmall circle of comrades.\u201d Gauguin referred to drawings such as the one in Chicago as \u201cdocuments,\u201d an essential aspect of the visual fieldwork he deemed necessary to prepare the more synthetic images he created in oil on canvas. A number of the charcoal and black-chalk drawings not only served as studies for paintings Gauguin executed in 1892 but informed paintings created as late as 1901. The large head served as a model for the woman seated at the right in the 1892 painting Arearea (Joyousness) (fig. 49.12 [W 468]), as well as for a female at the left of a 1901 work, Et l\u2019or de leur corps (And the Gold of Their Bodies) (fig. 49.13 [W 569]).\n\nThe head in profile at the left of the Chicago sheet appears, in reverse, in the woman at the left of two similar compositions from 1892, Tahitian Women on the Beach (fig. 49.14 [W 434]), and Parau api (What\u2019s New?) (fig. 49.15 [W 466]). Gauguin gave the same head a very faint rendition in another sketch from the series (fig. 49.16).\n\nGauguin used the back of a photograph he owned by Gustave Arosa, Column of Trajan (fig. 49.17), to execute studies in graphite, one of which is a head in profile close to that in the Chicago sheet (and thus related to the paintings mentioned above), although the figure\u2019s left eye is open rather than closed (fig. 49.18). A similar profile appears at the left of another portrait drawing from the group (fig. 49.19); the principal head on this sheet has not been linked with a painting. On the other hand, a further example (fig. 49.20)\u2014which includes a frontal view of a female head with two heads in profile, one below her and the other to her proper left\u2014can be connected with an 1899 painting, Two Tahitian Women (Breasts with Red Flowers) (fig. 49.21) [W 583]).\n\nAn imposing charcoal of a female head in a three-quarter pose (fig. 49.22 [Pickvance 73]) functioned as a study for the head of Eve in the 1892 painting Te nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (fig. 49.23 [W 455]). Two sheets cannot be linked to specific paintings in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre: the model in one is seen a three-quarter pose, her hair swept behind her neck and over her proper right shoulder (fig. 49.24); and the other, a particularly compelling charcoal and black-chalk rendition of a female head that occupies nearly the entire surface of the paper support (fig. 49.25 [Pickvance 72]). Two late studies, both from Gauguin\u2019s 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After), can be associated with the images on the recto of the Chicago work. The bust of Eve in a scene related to the story of Adam and Eve resembles the large head (fig. 49.26 [Rewald 119]), and on another page from Avant et apr\u00e8s Gauguin once again juxtaposed the frontal and profile views of the same person (fig. 49.27).\n\nGauguin used the verso of the present sheet to depict a single head, looking directly out at the viewer (fig. 49.1). Executed around the same time as the aforementioned charcoal drawings, this image presents a more specific individual than do the masklike heads seen on other sheets. It is thought to portray the artist\u2019s young mistress, Tehamana, and to have served as a preparatory study for the oil portrait Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana) (fig. 49.28 [cat. 50]). In the painting, Gauguin rendered his mistress\u2019s eyes fully, giving her sight, but he spread behind her an array of heads of tupapau (spirits) that provides a sense of mystery.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">Among the most striking images created by Gauguin on his first trip to Tahiti is a group of large black-chalk or charcoal drawings of the heads of male and female Tahitians (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). Two of the most important can be found on the recto and verso of this sheet. Both are related to paintings: the figure in the foreground of the recto surely informed\u2014without being a preparatory study per se\u2014the 1892 oil Arearea (Joyousness or Jokes) (fig. 49.10 [W 468]), as well as the much later painting Et l\u2019or de leur corps (And the Gold of Their Bodies) (fig. 49.29 [W 596]). The female on the verso has been identified as a portrait of Gauguin\u2019s teen-age companion Tehamana (fig. 49.30). It could have served as a preliminary study for the artist\u2019s 1893 painting of her, Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana) (fig. 49.31 [cat. 50] [W 497]).\n\nWhile both head studies relate to figures in paintings, they are drawn with such authority and insight that they would seem to have been made for their own sake, as independent works of art. In addition to the foreground figure, the image on the recto includes a much fainter rendition of a head in profile. The principal head is both more seductive and alluring than some of the other likenesses in the group. Another model, with arched eyebrows and a broad nose, can be identified on two different sheets on which the heads have become more abstracted, protective and masklike (fig. 49.32 and fig. 49.33). Finally, in another double portrait, all expression has been drained from the iconic head that cooly gazes out with sightless eyes (fig. 49.34). The fact that Gauguin signed this double portrait PGO signals that he intended it to be a stand-alone drawing.\n\nWhether or not Gauguin intended the exercise of depicting individual Tahitians as studies or actual portraits, his ability to capture a sense of personality and the feeling revealed in a glance or the tilt of a head is a skill that he had been developing over time. Tehamana seems trapped within her missionary-style dress, like a schoolgirl wary of being closely observed and drawn yet again. Gauguin\u2019s head studies show that he turned to drawing not only to document fleeting images of Tahitian life in his sketchbooks, but also to become familiar, even intimate, with the native people whose world he had entered and wanted to understand.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Ambroise Vollard (1866\u20131939), Paris.\n\nEstate of Ambroise Vollard to Wladimir Walter, Quatre Chemins, Paris.\n\nSold by Wladimir Walter to James Lord (1922\u20132009), Paris, 1947.\n\nJohn L.

The verso, Portrait of Tehamana, could have been a preliminary study for the 1893 painting Merahi metua no Tehamana (The Ancestors of Tehamana or Tehamana Has Many Parents) (cat. 50).\n\nSee Georges Wildenstein, Gauguin, with Raymond Cogniat and Daniel Wildenstein, vol. 1, Catalogue (Beaux-Arts, 1964), cats. 416\u201324. One of these, Piti teina (Two Sisters) was included in Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Paul Gauguin (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Nov. 1893), no. 29, but did not sell.\n\nSee Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Museum/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), p. 19. See also Paul Gauguin to Mette Gauguin, summer 1891, The Writings of a Savage, ed. Daniel Gu\u00e9rin, trans. Eleanor Levieux (Viking, 1978), p. 55.\n\nGauguin would have known about these fields and the images associated with them through his reading of illustrated periodicals such as Le tour du monde: Journal de voyages (1860\u20131914) and La nature (1873\u20131920). Both were illustrated periodicals that presented, in a popular-press format, current issues in anthropology, ethnography, and science. Illustrated dailies, which Gauguin also perused, often included articles about sensational crimes accompanied by images of criminal perpetrators seen in the frontal/profile format pioneered by the French police officer Alphonse Bertillon. For Gauguin\u2019s fascination with a lurid underworld murder, which became known as the \u201cPrado Affair,\u201d see Douglas W. Druick and Peter Kort Zegers, Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South, in collaboration with Britt Salvesen, with contributions by Kristin Hoermann Lister and the assistance of Mary C. Weaver, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Van Gogh Museum/Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001), pp. 257\u201360, 265\u201366. The inventory of his studio after his death in 1903 in the Marquesas mentions the presence of Dictionnaire de sciences.

For more on Gauguin\u2019s dependence on the visual materials that accompanied him to Polynesia, see cat. 53.\n\nRichard S. Field suggested that this painting was executed in November\u2013December 1892; Richard S. Field, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, exh. cat. (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), cat. 50.\n\nThis drawing relates to three paintings from 1898 and 1899: Three Tahitians (National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh [W 573]), Motherhood (Women on the Shore) (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W 581]), and Maternity II (W 582).\n\nArosa\u2019s photograph was published in Wilhelm Froehner, La colonne trajane, d\u2019apr\u00e8s le surmoulage ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 a Rome en 1861\u20131862 (J. Rothschild, 1872\u201374). Arosa at one time served as Gauguin\u2019s legal guardian.\n\nRegarding the determination of which side of the sheet is the recto and which side is the verso, a former owner of the sheet, the writer and biographer James Lord, admitted that he had been responsible for designating recto and verso and that he had done so entirely arbitrarily.

Stuckey, Feb. 3, 1989, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOne can see the evolution of his ability when these head studies are compared to a stiffer rendering in graphite of the head of a Tahitian woman that has been dated to 1891 (Rewald 93) and that is related to one of the first paintings that Gauguin undertook in Tahiti, Les parau parau (Conversation) (W 435).\n\nJames Lord to the Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 25, 1960, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nJames Lord to the Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 25, 1960, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nJames Lord to the Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 25, 1960, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.
