    "description": "<p>Join the Sustaining Fellows for special Art&nbsp;+ Film presentation featuring artist, writer, and activist Gregg Bordowitz.&nbsp;</p><p>An early participant in New York's ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power) and currently a professor and director of the Low-Residency MFA program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Bordowitz has made formally experimental works that explore his Jewish, gay, and bisexual identities within the context of the ongoing global AIDS crisis since the late 1980's.&nbsp;His engagement with avant-garde traditions in theater, poetry, comedy, and television draws influence from feminist conceptual art, combining performance documentation, archival footage, recordings of protest demonstrations, and role play into his own visual language.&nbsp;</p><p>The evening bookends three decades of Bordowitz's prodigious career as a videomaker by pairing one of his earliest videos,&nbsp;<em>Some Aspect of Shared Lifestyle</em>&nbsp;(1986), with the Chicago premiere of his latest work,&nbsp;<em>Only Idiots Smile&nbsp;</em>(2017). Following the videos, Bordowitz will lead a discussion and Q&amp;A. This special event offers an insightful introduction to the artist in advance of his exhibition,&nbsp;<a href=\"/exhibitions/9170/gregg-bordowitz-i-wanna-be-well\" target=\"_blank\"><em>I Wanna Be Well</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>opening on April 4 and his accompanying performances on April 5, 6 and 7. The evening includes a cocktail and dinner reception.&nbsp;</p><p>To register for this event or for more information, please contact the Office of the Sustaining Fellows at (312) 413-3735 or&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:sustainingfellows@artic.edu\">sustainingfellows@artic.edu</a>.<br></p><p>Event Co-chairs: Lori Gray Faversham and Penelope Steiner</p><p>This event is exclusively for members of the Sustaining Fellows.
