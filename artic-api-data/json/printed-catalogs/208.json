    "copy": " This publication offers a definitive look at the artistic practice of Remedios Varo (1908\u20131963) following her emigration from Spain to Mexico City in 1941. Her work from 1955 to 1963 made a lasting contribution to modern art and the legacy of Surrealism. In Remedios Varo: Science Fictions , fresh historical and material findings establish the integral relationship between Varo\u2019s layered interests\u2014in alchemy, architecture, magic, mysticism, philosophy, and science\u2014and her beguiling technical approach to art making. Essays detail specific works\u2019 complex stories and spectacular surfaces. An illustrated taxonomy of Varo\u2019s artistic techniques, including automatic mark making as well as careful manipulation of materials and media, offers new insights into the artist\u2019s craft. An illustrated inventory of a major portion of Varo\u2019s library\u2014published here for the first time\u2014reveals the artist\u2019s engagement with a wide range of subjects. Stunning new photography of many of her artworks are presented within a dynamic geometric design inspired by the artist\u2019s work. Situating Varo as a woman working in midcentury Mexico City and living among a tight-knit community of local and \u00e9migr\u00e9 artists, poets, and thinkers, the catalogue illuminates the complex worldview that shaped her search for individual and collective transcendence.
