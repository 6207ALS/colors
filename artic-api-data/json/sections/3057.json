Late in the spring of that year, American critic Walter Pach visited Matisse on behalf of the Montross Gallery, eager to arrange a presentation in New York, and near the end of June, German curator Curt Glaser traveled to Paris to organize an exhibition for the Kunstsalon Fritz Gurlitt in Berlin. Just as Pach\u2019s visits resulted in a portrait (cat. 20), so did Glaser\u2019s: this drawing is an image of his wife, Elsa, who accompanied her husband on his business.\n\nThe work\u2014which has pinholes in the upper corners from being tacked to Matisse\u2019s drawing board\u2014is one of numerous portrait drawings and prints Matisse made while he was working on the imposing portrait of Yvonne Landsberg (June\u2013mid-July 1914; fig. 19.1) over the spring and summer months of 1914. The painting of Landsberg, a young Brazilian woman, required many sessions and Matisse radically revised the canvas each time. Glaser\u2019s portrait, on the other hand, was likely produced in a single sitting and may well have been a welcome respite from the long labor of his painting, as well as an opportunity for Matisse to refresh and refine his thoughts through a less onerous process and approach. While more spare, the portrait of Elsa Glaser shares a number of characteristics with the more worked image of Landsberg, especially in its simplification of facial features. Both works demonstrate Matisse\u2019s experience under the influence of Cubist experimentation in their severe reduction of detail and geometric approach to form.\n\nIn the drawing, the denser areas of the hair and eyes are made up of numerous, overlapping hatched lines. Their cumulative weight is counterbalanced by the more schematic neck and shoulders and the open areas on the sides of the composition. Matisse emphasized Glaser\u2019s firmly ovoid head; solid chin; asymmetrical, heavy eyebrows; almond-shaped eyes; and short, cap-like hairstyle. Her compact appearance (see fig. 19.2) likewise suited Edvard Munch, who had represented her strong and striking features in three canvases just the year before. Matisse likely started the composition with Glaser\u2019s eyes, which he repositioned several times before settling on their placement on the page; he used their erased former positions as well as those of his sitter\u2019s original, shorter jawline to add volume. In contrast, he used short, repeated strokes to create the thin contours of her face and features. The cumulative effect evokes a sense of Matisse almost trying to conjure or coax the form of Glaser\u2019s face onto the sheet.\n\nPortrait of Elsa Glaser holds a noteworthy place among Matisse\u2019s drawings at this time, a bridge between the spare, repeated line of some of his portrait etchings (see fig. 19.3 and fig. 19.4) and the softer volumes of his charcoals and pencil drawings (see fig. 19.5, fig. 19.6, and fig. 19.7). These latter works, generally from late 1914 and 1915, likewise share the repositioned eyes seen in the portrait of Glaser and two feature a head that continues past the top of the sheet. Here, in the Art Institute\u2019s work, Matisse challenged himself to push his spare approach and produced a sense of delicate volume with elegant results.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this portrait in graphite pencil on smooth, cream wove paper. He began by placing the sitter using faint lines such as those still visible within the collar and neck. Then he built up all the contours using sketchy, repeating marks. He employed parallel hatching to shade the sitter\u2019s face, neck, and hair. Using a stump, he subtly softened and blended graphite lines through the proper right cheek, across the chin, and at the juncture where chin and neck meet to model the form (see fig. 19.8). Matisse shifted the placement of the eyes and eyebrows upward. He used an eraser to rub out the previous version of the eyes, although their former position remains slightly visible (see fig. 19.9). He had to erase in the eyelid and eyebrow region to reposition the brows. The artist also erased preliminary lines along the round contour of the woman\u2019s chin and cheeks, eliminating marks that positioned the face higher. He used the eraser to pull out highlights along the nose as well (see fig. 19.9). These two changes, lowering the chin and raising the eyes, elongate the face and communicate an erect posture or bearing. The crop at the sitter\u2019s head is original. Microscope examination at 80\u00d7 of the top edge reveals graphite extends over it. The sheet was not trimmed.\n\nMatisse chose a smooth, hot-pressed paper to allow even, uninterrupted graphite lines. He used a relatively soft and dark graphite pencil, possibly switching to an even softer and darker one to reposition the eyes. The artist drew with light to moderate pressure; raking-light examination of the verso confirms his marks left no indention on the sheet.\n\nThere are pinholes at the top corners, which may indicate Matisse tacked the sheet to a board as he drew or to the wall after it was finished.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri-Matisse 1914 (lower left, in graphite) (fig. 19.10).\n\nGraphite with touches of erasing and stumping.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, cream wove paper with a surface sheen noticeable in raking light. The smooth surface is well sized, making the surface hard and the sheet rigid. (Examination at 365 nm shows a strong whitish fluorescence, likely generated by the paper sizing.) The edges are straight cut. There is no evidence that the sheet was trimmed after drawing. For an image of the verso, see fig. 19.11.\n\n28.5 \u00d7 22.9 cm (11 1/4 \u00d7 9 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThere is smudged media (likely from the artist) and light surface soil, particularly at the margins. There are a very few brown spots in the lower left quadrant. There is a semicircular dent located 5.5 cm from the right edge and 17 cm from the bottom edge. Other minor handling dents are scattered throughout.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from the artist by Curt Glaser (May 29, 1879\u2013Nov. 23, 1943), Berlin; Switzerland; Florence, Italy; and New York, 1914\u2013Nov. 23, 1943.\n\nBy descent to his wife, Maria Glaser (born Maria Milch, Jan. 27, 1901; died Maria Ash, Aug. 1981), New York, from Nov. 23, 1943\u2013by Dec. 11, 1963.\n\nSold to Thomas Grange, London, and E.

For Matisse\u2019s explanation of the events of 1914, see Pierre Courthion, \u201cConversations avec Henri Matisse,\u201d unpublished typescript (1941), pp. 111\u201312, Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, Archives of the History of Art, Santa Monica. The catalogue for the Gurlitt exhibition is reproduced in Kasper Monrad, ed., Henri Matisse: Four Great Collectors (Statens Museum for Kunst, 1999), p. 144. For loans, Gurlitt turned first, with the assistance of the artist, to Marcel Sembat and his wife, Georgette Agutte, who refused, likely due to the escalating hostilities in Europe. With the encouragement of Matisse and Hans Purrmann, however, he was able to borrow nineteen canvases from the collection of Michael and Sarah Stein, who agreed \u201cout of kindness\u201d for Matisse. The exhibition opened in mid-July, but it closed when the war broke out just a few weeks later and the Steins\u2019 works were unfortunately stranded in Germany. Oskar and Greta Moll, the latter a student at the Acad\u00e9mie Matisse, were living in Germany and took the paintings into safekeeping for the Steins. When the United States entered the war in 1917, the German government confiscated the works as enemy property. The Steins eventually succeeded in getting the works back, but only after prolonged negotiations. For more on these events, see Fiske Kimball, \u201cMatisse: Recognition, Patronage, Collecting,\u201d Philadelphia Museum Bulletin 43, no. 217 (Mar. 1948): p. 35; Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Matisse: His Art and His Public (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1951), pp. 177\u201378; Pierre Schneider, Matisse, trans.

In spite of their ongoing struggles to secure the return of their paintings, the Steins remained supportive of Matisse.\n\nElsa Kolker, cousin of the dealer Hugo Perls, married Curt Glaser in 1903. By many accounts she was a lively intellectual and strong personality, and she led the Monday Salons at the Glasers\u2019 home in the 1920s. Years after her death, Elsa Glaser was remembered rather unflatteringly by \u201cQuappi\u201d (Mathilde von Kaulbach) Beckmann, who recalled that she was \u201calmost deaf\u201d by the time her husband, Max Beckmann, painted Curt Glaser\u2019s portrait (1929; Saint Louis Art Museum) and wondered whether she \u201calready had that unfortunate ear-ailment when Matisse did the drawing. That searching look in the eyes made me think of it.\u201d Quappi Beckmann to Harold Joachim, Nov. 17, 1965, curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.
