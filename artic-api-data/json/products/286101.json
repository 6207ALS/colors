    "description": "<p>Blank State is more than a coloring book: it is an exercise in collaboration, inviting the participant to contribute to the act of creation. Architecture and urban planning impact our lives dramatically, dictating how we interact with our everyday environments, yet they are largely out of the layperson\u2019s control. This book allows everyone to make their mark through the use of color and value. Starting with prehistory and progressing through a re-imagined past, present, and future, this book reinvents an architectural legacy, a \u201cblank state\u201d ready to be colored in or not. All that is needed is imagination and a willingness to dream.</p><ul><li><strong>Soft Cover</strong></li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.25 x 11.75 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 55</li></ul>",
