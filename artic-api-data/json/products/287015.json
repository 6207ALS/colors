    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scarf developed from Paul Cezanne\u2019s <em>The Bathers</em>, 1899-1904, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Through his studies of groups of bathers outdoors, Paul C\u00e9zanne reconceived a classical subject in a modern, pictorial idiom. It is an independent, exploratory work painted with a more spritely touch. For all its compositional complexity, it retains the lightness of a watercolor, with thin parallel strokes and dashes and areas of white-primed canvas showing through the paint.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>33 x 40 in.</li><li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>100% polyester.</li><li><strong>Hand wash, hang dry.</strong></li></ul>",
