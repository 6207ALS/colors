    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In 1893, having spent two years in Tahiti in the South Pacific Gauguin returned to Paris eager to sell some of the work he had made there.  Although Gauguin's paintings made in the South Pacific mix reality and invention, here he is working in his Paris studio.  &quot;Day of the Gods&quot; is a brilliantly colored souvenir, a memory of his voyage, conjured up for a Paris audience.  The painting's composition is symmetrical and decorative and separates out the exotic cosmology of Tahiti from the natural world.  The three figures with the female bather in the center may represent birth, life, and death.  Behind them, women bring a tray of offerings to Hina, the ancient Polynesian moon goddess and co-creator of the universe.  The area to the right of the goddess seems devoted to love and sensuality.  Gauguin had gone to Tahiti in search of inspiration in the form of a simple, ancient culture.  He was keenly disappointed to discover that French Colonialism had all but erased the old beliefs.  Gauguin had to search anthropological texts for Polynesian legends and supplement his own sketches with images from books and photographs to create the mysterious, semi-imaginary world in his paintings.</p>\n",
