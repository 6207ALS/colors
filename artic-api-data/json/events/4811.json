The primary focus of her own work is Kente, a Ghanaian textile. She is most inspired by the way each strip is woven and how each cloth is worn to represent a person\u2019s individuality through color and pattern. In her work, she documents her personal experiences through color, materials, and pattern. Bryana is currently a resident artist at the Bridgeport Art Center in Chicago. She has also taught in fashion/textile programs in Chicago\u2019s After School Matters and recently joined the teaching artist faculty at the Evanston Art Center.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
