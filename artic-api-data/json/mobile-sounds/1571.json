    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: This is Madame Cezanne. It was the artist\u2019s former model whom he married, 1886. They had one child and she was really his favorite model, maybe because Cezanne was so reclusive and he didn\u2019t make friends easily, that he chose his wife, the easiest person he could find in his household to paint again and again and again. And what\u2019s wonderful about these portraits is that they\u2019re always sort of enigmatic, but at the same time object-like. She really takes the place of his beloved apples that he showed again and again in still lifes. And he shows her almost as geometric shapes that are connected in some way, but without any real personality. I mean, here\u2019s a woman with whom he\u2019s lived for years and years and yet she has a mask and her eyes are little slits and there\u2019s no way we can find out what she\u2019s all about or communicate with her, because that\u2019s not what he\u2019s interested in. He\u2019s looking at her as a series of formal shapes and contours. And, yet, she also has this wonderful roundedness to her. She\u2019s a series of ovals until you get to her fingers, which are sort of squid-like and writhing and they\u2019re agitated and they\u2019re nervous, in complete contra-distinction to the placidness of her expression. It\u2019s like all her energy is seeping down into her fingers as they clinch each other.</p>\n",
