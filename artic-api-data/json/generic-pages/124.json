This opportunity is open to all teenagers enrolled in Chicagoland high schools. Apply today to join us and activate the museum with your voice and perspective. \u201cWorking with the museum has been one of the most fulfilling activities I\u2019ve ever done. It has made me see that teens have a place here, and I can help make that place a little bit larger with every meeting we have.\u201d \u2014Mia, Teen Council member   Summer Internship June\u2013August Do you have a passion for art? Are you curious about museums? Apply for a summer internship to work with other teens at the Art Institute and support festivals, gallery tours, and workshops that serve thousands of local and international visitors.

These summer internships are open to Chicago high school teens who will be at least 16 at the start of the internship. Applications open in the spring through After School Matters . \u201cThis internship made me so much more extroverted. Learning interpersonal skills was pivotal to my life. Learning how to talk to people . . . I don\u2019t know where else I could have learned it. I never spoke in class before and I was able to find a voice in classes after being in this internship.\u201d \u2014Gus, Summer intern   Support for Summer Learning at the Art Institute of Chicago is generously provided by The Jane Wilson and David Mayhew Stone Charitable Trust.
