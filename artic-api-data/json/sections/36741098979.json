Aside from Edgar Degas, however, the Impressionists did not regularly take up this subject in their paintings of modern life; when the theme did appear in Impressionist work, it was typically \u201csubordinated to the atmospheric surroundings.\u201d The Laundress is indeed an anomaly in the oeuvre of Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Although he returned to the subject in the mid-1880s and later\u2014though only a handful of times\u2014this canvas is likely the artist\u2019s first and only incorporation of the motif during the time when he was actively engaged with the concerns of Impressionism.\n\nAs noted by Douglas Druick, Renoir probably made The Laundress\u2014which is signed, but not dated\u2014after completing his illustrations for \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s gritty novel L\u2019assommoir, a tragic tale centered around a laundress named Gervaise Macquart, which exposed the blight of poverty and alcoholism in contemporary working-class Paris. Originally published by Renoir\u2019s patron, Georges Charpentier, in 1877, the first illustrated edition of L\u2019assommoir appeared the following year. At Zola\u2019s request, Renoir created four illustrations for it. But while Zola could present his vivid narrative with words, Renoir had to find a way to visualize select scenes in a two-dimensional format. As the Art Institute\u2019s original drawing for one of the illustrations (fig. 6.1 (cat. 5) demonstrates, the artist\u2014using pen, brown ink, and black chalk\u2014combined areas of shading with a web of thin, scratchy lines in order to produce a vibrating surface that teems with an almost restless energy.\n\nBy the mid-1870s, Renoir was also creating similar effects in his paintings, as The Laundress exemplifies. Using a limited palette and a variety of techniques, he crafted a shimmering surface through a complex, built-up network of feathery brushstrokes. Combined with some areas of smooth modeling and heavy impasto, Renoir\u2019s brushwork and use of complementary-color contrasts construct a tapestry of textures to suggest space and form. Precise contours were dissolved and details of the background were obscured as the artist decreased the density of his web of brushstrokes around the edges of the painting, allowing more of the warm gray ground layer to peek through (fig. 6.2).\n\nThe casualness of Renoir\u2019s brushstrokes and the confidence demonstrated by his use of wet-in-wet paint and his juxtaposition of individual strokes of unmixed, bold color to create areas like the figure\u2019s hair (fig. 6.3) suggest that he executed this painting quickly. It seems that he actually developed it relatively systematically, however. The traditional triangular composition provides stability to the otherwise vibrating surface, and X-ray imaging indicates that the artist reinforced this form by straightening out the hemline of the model\u2019s skirt (fig. 6.4).\n\nRenoir also altered the posture of the model as he worked out his composition. In an earlier state of the painting, the figure was slightly more frontal, and her elbows projected out from her body more symmetrically. By adjusting her arms and both sides of her skirt, Renoir shifted her body ever so slightly to a three-quarter angle. The alteration he made to her left arm is still visible with the naked eye: flesh tones appear around the area where her wrist meets her awkwardly disproportionate hand (fig. 6.5). Renoir also lowered the height of her hair and the frothy pile of laundry beside her in order to achieve the exact balance that he was seeking.\n\nThere is something very deliberate and even disconcerting about the way Renoir constructed\u2014or rather, deconstructed\u2014his young laundress. The model for this painting was identified by Fran\u00e7ois Daulte as Nini Lopez, whom Renoir employed regularly between approximately 1874 and 1880. A resident of Montmartre, the Parisian quarter where Renoir moved in the summer of 1876, Nini was characterized by critic Georges Rivi\u00e8re as the ideal model, for she was \u201cpunctual, serious, [and] discreet.\u201d But while she can be identified in The Laundress, this is not a portrait; her features are generalized and dissolve into a frenzy of brushstrokes. Instead, Renoir depicted a Parisian type\u2014in this case, a young, working-class girl.\n\nRenoir also used Nini as his model in another, probably slightly earlier painting entitled First Step (Le premier pas) (fig. 6.6 [Daulte 347; Dauberville 250]). In this picture, however, Nini\u2014who appears to be wearing the same blouse and skirt that she wore when posing for The Laundress\u2014seems to embody a different type of Parisian woman. The figure that Renoir presented in Le premier pas is more refined and polished. Her facial features\u2014though still generalized\u2014are more delicate; using minimized brushstrokes, Renoir gave her skin a porcelain-like finish that glows like mother-of-pearl. Set in what appears to be the interior of a bourgeois dwelling\u2014as indicated by the richly patterned, colorful carpet underfoot\u2014she looks lovingly at a child, encouraging it to take its first steps. In many ways, Renoir made Nini a radiant, modern Madonna in this painting.\n\nBut, simultaneously, Renoir infused a degree of ambiguity in Le premier pas that makes us question this characterization. While both of Nini\u2019s shoulders are covered, the hint of cleavage revealed as she leans toward the child highlights her sexuality; she is both demure and provocative. Her garment is simple and pulled together with the red sash at her waist, but its silhouette is not of the period. As a result of her pose, the waist appears to be cinched higher than was fashionable at the time, recalling instead coquettish Rococo fashion. Moreover, a white garment and striped socks draped over the chair suggest two possible identities for the woman. Perhaps she is the child\u2019s mother and lady of the house awaiting the arrival of her laundress through the half-open door at right, or she might be a domestic caring for the child before undertaking her laundry chores, a woman who might even be sexually available. At this time, Renoir\u2019s audience would have been aware that working women were known to sometimes supplement their incomes with prostitution.\n\nAs part of the Impressionist group, Renoir was interested in depicting themes of modern life, but his worldview was much more tempered than those of Zola and some of his other Naturalist and Impressionist colleagues. Even in his own era Renoir was accused of viewing the world with rose-colored glasses. As John House has explained, \u201cEven in their original contexts, the vision of the world presented by Renoir\u2019s canvases was escapist; his smiling world-view was an attempt to erase the fundamental anxieties of the late nineteenth century, about the breakdown of order and of the sense of social and personal identity in a society that was rapidly changing, with the emergence of industrialisation and urban capitalism.\u201d\n\nBut however tame Renoir\u2019s imagery may seem, the subtle ambiguities that he infused into Le premier pas remind us of the disconnects between class and gender in modern life and highlight the difficulty of expressing these ideas visually on a flat surface. Such uncertainties are even more exaggerated in The Laundress. Despite its similarities to Le premier pas, The Laundress is radically different in execution. The artist\u2019s brushwork recalls the graphic, hatched quality of the drawings he made for Zola\u2019s novel, which he also employed in a painted portrait of his friend and fellow Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley (fig. 6.7 [cat. 4]).\n\nIn large part because of the nature of the paint handling, much of the painting is impossible to read. Aside from the laundress, very few details of the composition can be definitively identified: the model stands next to a half-open door, on the other side of which is a completely illegible space; to the left of the laundress, there is only a vague impression of a yellow table or chair in what appears to be a hallway or another room; shadows on the floor do not consistently correspond with the light source coming from the upper left; and the clothes in the laundry basket\u2014composed of swirls of paint\u2014are not identifiable (fig. 6.8).\n\nIt is also curious that although the surface of The Laundress pulsates insistently, no substantial action is being depicted in the scene. With her flushed face, reddened hands, and basket of unfolded laundry sitting on the floor next to her, the laundress\u2019s work is evident; this is perhaps the moment after the laundry was washed but before it was ironed, for the streaks of blue visible throughout the laundry pile may indicate that it has just been treated with bluing, a product used during laundering to enhance whitening. But in this particular moment, as Druick has observed, the laundress is not actively undertaking difficult labor, and there is no reason for her blouse to have slipped off of one of her shoulders. Renoir\u2019s depiction of the young woman with d\u00e9colletage\u2014a motif he would feature in many other paintings of young women throughout his career\u2014encourages a sexual, voyeuristic reading. At the same time that the young woman exhibits sexual and social vulnerability, however, she also conveys a sense of defiance. Solidly placed in the center of the composition with her hands on her hips, she has a certain resolve and confidence that suggests she is perhaps more in control of her own destiny than Zola\u2019s laundress, Gervaise.\n\nIn the 1880s, Renoir abandoned his pursuit of urban, modern-life subjects and his broken, textured brushwork for more timeless, idyllic imagery inspired by the French countryside and the more precise forms and techniques of the Old Masters. When he picked up the theme of the laundress again nearly ten years later, his model was not Nini Lopez but rather his future wife, Aline Charigot, holding their first son, Pierre (fig. 6.9). Although his 1870s depiction speaks to the modern life of the city, Renoir\u2014from the mid-1880s onward\u2014related the theme of the laundress to the country, nature, hard work, and maternity.  \nGloria Groom and Jill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began this work on a warm-gray, commercially primed canvas; the color of the priming is visible in many areas of the background and gives the work a unifying undertone. The original size of the composition is unclear; however, it appears that the work may have been slightly larger than a standard size. Unfinished edges and individual brushstrokes that pass onto the tacking margin complicate an assessment of the painting\u2019s original size. There is no discernible compositional planning, and the X-ray and infrared images show that the artist shifted the pose of the figure through a series of small alterations in the paint stages. Initially, the figure\u2019s gaze was more frontal, her hair pulled tighter toward the top of the head, her hips pushed slightly to the right, and the hem of her skirt shorter on the sides, making her appear longer in relation to her surroundings than she does in the final composition. Renoir also made slight changes in the placement of her arms, especially her left one, some of which are visible under normal viewing conditions.\n\nThe artist used a limited palette and varied the size and concentration of brushstrokes throughout the work. In the figure, areas of very fine strokes of unmixed color placed side by side while still wet contrast with smoothly modeled areas and heavy impasto created by dragging stiff paint with a fine, soft brush. These effects are seen in the figure\u2019s hair, skirt, and blouse, respectively. The flesh tones\u2014primarily lead white with some vermilion and red lake\u2014were modeled with a combination of these methods. As the artist moved from the figure to her surroundings, covering his compositional changes with strokes of background colors, the composition became less detailed, marked by broader brushstrokes and large areas of exposed ground.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 6.10).\n\nSigned (lower left, in warm blue paint): Renoir. (fig. 6.11 and fig. 6.12).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nAs there is no obvious painted edge, the original size of the canvas is unclear and depends largely on whether the stretcher is original. If this is the original stretcher, the dimensions appear to have been approximately 80.7 \u00d7 56 cm. The closest standard sizes are seascape (marine) 25 haute and basse, which measure 81 \u00d7 54 cm and 81 \u00d7 56.7 cm, respectively.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 16.4V (0.7) \u00d7 13.8H (0.4) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThere is mild cusping along the top and bottom edges corresponding to the placement of the original tacks and some variation in thread thickness in both directions. The thread-count weft-angle map also indicates two places in the upper right quadrant where there was a warp-thread repair, causing the perpendicular weft threads to distort around it (fig. 6.13).\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting was lined and restretched prior to 1956 (see Conservation History). It is unclear if the dimensions changed during this treatment. The X-ray indicates that although some of the old tack holes were reused at this time, cusping along the top and bottom edges does not correspond to current tack placement. Where the tacking margin is not obscured by paper tape, it appears the painting is currently attached with steel tacks through both the original and lining canvases.\n\nOriginal stretching: As the edges are largely covered with paper tape, it is not clear how many times the painting was stretched. Based on cusping visible along the top and bottom in the X-ray, tacks were placed approximately 5\u20137 cm apart. There is almost no discernible scalloping in the weft-angle map or the X-ray for the left side and very little information on the right. Along the right edge, there is a crease approximately 0.5 cm from the edge, and a corresponding set of extra tack holes appears just beyond the current foldover. These holes are not always visible but may correspond to the faint angle changes illustrating cusping on the right edge in the weft-angle map (fig. 6.14). If this crease represents an earlier foldover, the width of the painting would be about 56 cm. Gaps between stretcher members on the verso suggest that closing the members of the current, expanded stretcher (tapping in) would accommodate this 0.5 cm.\n\nWhile the height of this painting corresponds to a standard size, the width has a larger discrepancy. The edges of the composition are not clear, as they are often unfinished or have brushstrokes running over the foldover, but there is no physical evidence to suggest the work was ever smaller than 56 cm wide.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Six-member keyable mortise-and-tenon stretcher with vertical and horizontal crossbars.\n\nThe stretcher may be original to the painting, but this remains unclear, as the painting was lined, mounted to hardboard, and restretched (see Conservation History). The stretcher\u2019s structure and patina suggest that if it is not original to the painting, it was added early in the painting\u2019s lifetime (fig. 6.15). Depth: 1.7 cm.\n\nCross-sectional analysis indicates a thin brownish layer of material between the paint and canvas that closely follows the canvas texture. This material is organic in nature and estimated to be glue (fig. 6.16).\n\nThe preparation is a two-layered (or lisse), commercially applied ground that extends to the edges of the tacking margins. The lower layer of the ground has an approximate thickness of 10\u201360 \u00b5m, while the upper, toned layer is approximately 15\u201345 \u00b5m thick. It is smooth, somewhat fills the canvas weave, and is left visible throughout the background.\n\nThe upper ground layer is a warm gray, with black and yellow particles visible microscopically. Microscopic examination reveals the creamy white initial ground layer visible along the tops of some of the abraded threads (fig. 6.17).\n\nThe commercial ground is a two-layered preparation with a whitish first layer consisting of primarily lead white with small amounts of iron oxide yellow, associated silicates, barium sulfate, and calcium sulfate. The upper layer is a warm gray made of a complex mixture of lead white, bone black, and iron oxide red and yellow, with associated complex silicates, quartz, calcium sulfate, and a trace amount of Naples yellow (fig. 6.18). Both layers are estimated to be bound in an oil medium.\n\nNo compositional planning visible with infrared or microscopy.\n\nRenoir made many changes to the figure\u2019s posture in The Laundress. There are heavy strokes of underpaint above and to the right of the figure that may mask some changes (fig. 6.19); however, a number of small later changes can still be discerned on the painting\u2019s surface. X-ray analysis suggests that the skirt was originally placed slightly to the right, with a lower red waistband (fig. 6.20), as if the figure were shifting her weight slightly to one side. In response, the artist swung her left arm farther out to the side, while her right arm was placed slightly closer to her body (fig. 6.21). Some of the changes to the figure\u2019s arms and hands were made quickly and remain visible on the work\u2019s surface (fig. 6.22). The initial profile of the woman\u2019s left arm and hand were roughly painted out with fine background strokes. Close examination of the surface reveals flesh tones visible between these fine strokes along the outer edge of the arm and hand. From the infrared reflectogram (IRR) and X-ray, it appears that the artist may have moved the figure\u2019s left arm more than once, as the flesh tone extends under the background paint for a distance. Specific movements are difficult to discern, however. Renoir also quickly indicated an extension of the figure\u2019s blouse at the neckline, bringing up the top slightly near her left shoulder. Initially, the skirt\u2019s profile appeared thinner and the figure seemed to be turned more toward the viewer (fig. 6.10). Raking light and infrared examination also indicate changes to her hairstyle in the final version of the painting: her bun was higher on her head and more tightly held in place with a dark band. The general effect of these changes is that the figure appears bulkier, with a less defined waist. Renoir also reduced the laundry pile at the lower right, adding a bright red background to trim the upper edge of the pile.\n\nRenoir used wider brushstrokes toward the edges of the picture, in the laundry, and along the right side, which broadly contrast with the densely applied, finer strokes associated with the figure (fig. 6.23) and her immediate surroundings. After masking some compositional changes with heavy strokes of paint that tonally mimic the ground color, he continued changing the figure\u2019s posture. The composition\u2019s background wraps around the figure in fine, separate strokes, often directly covering later pentimenti. Renoir alternated individual strokes of unmixed, bold color placed side by side, as in the figure\u2019s hair (fig. 6.24), with more blended, softer transitions between colors and crisscross patterns, as in the skirt. In some areas, soft, fine brushes dragged stiff paint across the surface, leaving heavy impasto with small peaks from lifting the brush (fig. 6.25). The flesh tones appear to alternate between these three techniques; the artist began with a smoother modeling that he later textured with heavy impasto and directional strokes. In other areas, such as the laundry pile and the figure\u2019s blouse, he utilized stiff-bristled brushes, leaving a heavy texture in the paint surface.\n\nVery fine brushes, flat and round, up to 1 cm width.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, vermilion, two red lakes, chrome yellow, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, emerald green, iron oxide red and/or iron oxide yellow, and bone black.\n\nUV examination suggests the presence of fluorescing red lake, particularly in the flesh tones and limited portions of the background, based on the observation of a characteristic, orange fluorescence (fig. 6.26). Visible through microscopic analysis of the surface and cross sections of other portions of the composition, such as the background along the left edge, is a second, nonfluorescing red lake.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish was applied in 1969 and replaced a different synthetic varnish from the 1956\u201357 treatment. Application of this earlier synthetic varnish followed removal of a discolored oil-resin varnish. As the painting was already lined at the time of this treatment (1956\u201357), it is unclear whether the oil-resin varnish was original to the painting.\n\nThe painting has had two documented treatments since acquisition. The earliest notes on the painting come from a 1937 memo indicating that the canvas was in good condition and the frame miters were opening. By 1956 the painting was noted as lined and mounted to a board (either a thin wooden panel or a Masonite-type hardboard), with a secondary, unprimed fabric on the verso of the board, indicating previous undocumented treatment. Although lined, the painting retained its stretcher; the stretcher is either original or evidence of a very early treatment. In January 1957, the work was treated, and an oil-resin varnish was removed along with a heavy layer of grime using a combination of solvent and mechanical cleaning. The work was given a spray coat of synthetic varnish (n/butyl isobutyl methacrylate copolymer resin); retouching was not deemed necessary at the time. In 1969 the work was given a second aesthetic treatment during which the 1957 varnish was removed and replaced with three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe work is in good condition, aqueously lined to a secondary canvas and mounted to an unidentified thin panel. The panel features unprimed canvas on its verso and therefore cannot be positively identified. The panel is concave, creating a slightly dished appearance, but appears stable at this time. There are minimal localized losses to the paint layer, cracking throughout the sections of blue paint (including the skirt and the background left of center), and stretcher-bar creases corresponding to the horizontal crossbar. Along the foldover on all sides, there is abrasion and grime, in addition to localized cracking of both the paint and the support resulting from the lining process.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed after 1948): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, late-eighteenth-century, Louis XVI, scotia frame with acanthus leaves, beading, and leaf-and-tongue sight molding. The frame has water and oil gilding over red bole on gesso. The ornament and outer fillet are burnished. The frame sustained water damage and was subsequently painted with bronze powder paint. It retains most of the original gilding, except on the heavily damaged bottom section. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled, dovetailed splines. At some point in the frame\u2019s history, the original verso was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance, a back frame was added, and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; scotia side; stepped fillet; scotia with acanthus leaves and beaded fillet; frieze; fillet; ogee with leaf-and-tongue ornament; fillet with a cove sight edge; and an independent fillet liner with a cove sight edge that was added when the painting was paired with the frame (fig. 6.27).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1948): The work was previously housed in a late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, reverse ogee frame with cast plaster anthemia corner cartouches and shell center cartouches linked by foliate scrollwork (fig. 6.28).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, June 15, 1882.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Aug. 3, 1905, for 8,500 francs.\n\nSold by Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, to the Prince de Wagram (Alexandre Berthier, 4th Prince de Wagram), Paris, by Feb. 24, 1906.\n\nResold by the Prince de Wagram (Alexandre Berthier, 4th Prince de Wagram), Paris, to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Feb. 24, 1906, for 9,000 francs.\n\nPossibly sold by Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, to L\u00e9on Orosdi, Paris (died 1922), Mar. 2, 1906.\n\nAcquired by Gal\u00e9rie Barbazanges, Paris, by Jan. 4, 1923.\n\nAcquired by Meyer Goodfriend, New York and Paris, by Jan. 4, 1923.\n\nSold at the sale of Meyer Goodfriend, New York and Paris, New American Art Galleries, New York, Jan. 5, 1923, lot 109, to John Levy Galleries, New York, for $2,000.\n\nAcquired by Howard Young, New York, by Mar. 28, 1923.\n\nSold by Howard Young, New York, to Charles H.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that was given to the painting when it was first documented in Durand-Ruel\u2019s stock book for 1891. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\n\n1891: Blanchisseuse (Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1891 [no. 1520]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 5, 2010, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.)\n\nMay 1892: Laveuse (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Paris, Exposition A. Renoir, exh. cat. [Imp. de l\u2019Art, E. M\u00e9nard et Cie, 1892], p. 37, cat. 8.)\n\nAug. 3, 1905: Blanchisseuse (Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1901 [no. 1520]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 5, 2010, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.)\n\nIn Douglas W. Druick, Renoir, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1997), Druick redated the painting to 1877/79 to incorporate its possible connection to Renoir\u2019s illustrations for \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s novel L\u2019Assommoir, whose main protagonist is a laundress. Renoir made these illustrations in 1877 or 1878, when the illustrated edition of the book was published. See memo, July 31, 1997, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In the past, The Laundress was dated c. 1880 because of its similarity to Renoir\u2019s painting Le premier pas, which was long thought to be signed and dated 1880. In 2002, when that painting reappeared on the market, the 1880 date was refuted, and the work was published as signed and dated \u201cRenoir 76.\u201d See Christie\u2019s, London, Impressionist and Modern Art (Evening Sale), sale cat.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, coupled with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue with red lake. The presence of cobalt was confirmed with XRF. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 15, 2011; and Sonia Maccagnola and Francesca Casadio, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_Artax\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2011, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee chart of standard sizes available from Lefranc &amp; Cie in 1889 reproduced in Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 15, fig. 24. Original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, in addition to restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out of the canvas over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Pierre-Auguste Renoir, The Laundress (D348/1947.102),\u201d July 2011.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Pierre-Auguste Renoir, The Laundress (D348/1947.102),\u201d July 2011. Warp-thread repair feature was identified through e-mail correspondence with Don Johnson after his visit to Claessens Belgian commercial priming factory (www.claessens-va.be), Jan. 27, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nWhile the current measurements are very close to an available standard size (marine 25 basse), the closed stretcher dimensions reflect enough of a discrepancy to suggest the possibility of a nonstandard size. Tack holes present along the edges and cusping seen in the X-ray suggest the work was at one time approximately 56 cm wide.\n\nThe cross-section sample from the edge of the tacking margin was the only sample containing all layers, including the canvas. The sizing layer exhibits a bluish fluorescence associated with organic materials, such as glue. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of lead white, iron oxide pigments and calcium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also identified calcium sulfate, complex silicates, quartz and Naples yellow. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011; Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 15, 2011; and Sonia Maccagnola and Francesca Casadio, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_Artax\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2011, all on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nPigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, vermilion, chrome yellow, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, bone black, iron oxide red and/or iron oxide yellow (XRF, SEM/EDX); emerald green (XRF); two red lakes (optical microscopy, SEM/EDX). For more detailed results and specific conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Sept. 15, 2011; Sonia Maccagnola and Francesca Casadio, \u201cRen\\_Laundress\\_47\\_102\\_Artax\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2011; and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011, all on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. The Artax report represents an update with additional XRF analysis to specifically address the distribution and composition of cerulean and cobalt blues in the painting. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present.\n\nSEM/EDX analysis indicated that the substrate for both lakes is aluminum. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSEM/EDX identified the presence of magnesium-containing cerulean blue in samples taken from the edges of the painting. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_102\\_Renoir\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Aug. 29, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.

This report represents an update with additional XRF analysis to specifically address the distribution and composition of cerulean and cobalt blues throughout the painting.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lake, including its fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.
