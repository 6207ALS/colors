    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A poem by the Italian medieval poet Dante inspired this painting. The poem tells of Dante's great love, Beatrice, who dies young. We see Beatrice as she is about to enter the spirit world. She leans forward, transfixed, as a holy bird drops a white poppy into her lap symbolizing her approaching transformation. The painting's format echoes that of a medieval Italian church altarpiece with its main image above and smaller narrative panel below, all contained within a splendid gold leaf pane. In the lower panel, Dante finds Beatrice once again in the spirit world. The painting is by Dante Gabrielle Rossetti. Rossetti belonged to a group of young English artists called the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who wanted to return to pre-Renaissance ways of painting.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM:  But Rossetti was different because he really was a poet and he looked to literature and poetry for his subject matter and almost for his philosophy of life. So in a way, it's very poignant because his own life in some ways paralleled that poem in the sense that his model for this is his wife who had died ten years ago before he began painting this.</p>\n",
