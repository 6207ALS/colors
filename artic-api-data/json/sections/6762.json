As he wrote to the Surrealist poet Louis Aragon in April 1942, \u201cI finally found the object I have been seeking for more than a year. It is a baroque Venetian chair varnished with silver tints. Like an enamel . . . When I found it in an antique shop I was bowled over. It is splendid, I am possessed by it.\u201d As pictured in the artist\u2019s studio (see fig. 51.2), this stunning object had metallic scallop-shells for the seat and back, and green eel-like armrests with monstrous heads. It appears in many of his works, including Dancer and Rocaille Armchair on a Black Background (1942; fig. 51.3) and Rocaille Armchair (1946; fig. 51.4). While the chair is often depicted as a solid golden block of color with green or blue arms in his paintings, for his fluid 1943 colored-pencil drawing Blue Vase on a Venetian Armchair he used sweeping pencil strokes to capture its elaborate detail and slithering, animalistic armrests. The flattened form frames the blue vase, with its flowing green leaves and yellow flowers, augmenting the organic form and decorative elements of the chair.\n\nAround this time, Matisse began a series of line drawings, one hundred and fifty-eight of which were published in 1943 under the collective title Themes and Variations and divided into seventeen sequences according to subject. This colored-pencil study of a vase of flowers on an armchair is perhaps a direct descendent of the series. The drawing shares with the suite an economy of line and an emphasis on flat shapes. Blue Vase on a Venetian Armchair, however, differs from the deceptively simple drawings of Themes and Variations in the greater intensity of the parallel lines in the chair arms and the bouquet\u2019s blooms and leaves. It is further distinguished from drawings in the series by the composition\u2019s ornamental nature and the exaggeration of the linear components, which are more cursive and stylized.  \nBrandon Ruud and Marin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew the composition directly in colored pencils, with no preliminary marks, on ivory wove paper. He drew with his pencils held at an angle, using the side of the tip to lay in broad, colored strokes. The colored pencils recorded the fine screen pattern on the paper surface, leaving broken, textured lines (see fig. 51.5). Matisse used greater pressure to draw the yellow flowers, which yielded denser lines; microscope examination at 80\u00d7 shows a buildup of waxy binder along the yellow pencil strokes (see fig. 51.6). Where two dense strokes appear adjacent to one another they create the illusion of a white line drawn between them. This is only the white of the paper.\n\nThere are pinholes at all corners and at the center of the right and left edges, likely from pinning the paper to a support while drawing. There is a faint black residue on the verso in the region of the pencil lines, indicating that some black material was picked up from the surface of Matisse\u2019s drawing board by the pressure of his pencils. The sheet has not been cut down.\n\nSigned: HM (lower left, in graphite) (fig. 51.7).\n\nColored pencils.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The sheet has a very fine yet pronounced screen pattern. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left have an imitation deckle edge, indicating that the paper is moldmade. There is a watermark in the upper left corner: Arches (1 \u00d7 3 cm) (fig. 51.8).\n\n52.5 \u00d7 40.5 cm (20 3/4 \u00d7 16 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThe edges exhibit tight cockling. There are brown stains near each corner on the verso (fig. 51.9), likely from earlier adhesive.\n\nThere is minor black residue on the verso deposited along some drawn lines, suggesting the pressure from the pencils caused material to offset from the support used during drawing.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Probably Jacques Dubourg (1897\u20131981), Galerie Jacques Dubourg, Paris, by June 1962.\n\nUnidentified owner.\n\nSold, Sotheby\u2019s London, lot 420, to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (c. 1921\u2013Jan. 5, 2015), Brookline, MA, June 25, 1986\u2013June 19, 2013.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 19, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Jacques Dubourg, Henri Matisse: Aquarelles, dessins, June 1962, cat. 34 (ill.), as Vase bleu sur un fauteuil v\u00e9nitien, 1943.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K.

Most of the works are devoted to figures, but there are also several still-life motifs, such as series G (an array of Matisse\u2019s favorite props, including the blue vase), series H (a single vase with ivy), and series M (fruit and flowers). Themes and Variations includes sheets drawn in various media, including crayon, pen and ink, and pencil. Furthermore, Matisse made subtle changes to the compositions of each drawing in a sequence, a process he described as \u201ca cinematography of the sentiments of an artist.\u201d Henri Matisse, quoted in Francis Carco, \u201cConversation avec Matisse,\u201d in L\u2019ami des peintres (Gallimard, 1953), as translated in \u201cInterview with Francis Carco, 1941,\u201d in Jack Flam, Matisse on Art, rev. ed.
