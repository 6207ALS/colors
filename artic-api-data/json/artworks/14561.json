    "description": "<p>The table in this still life of flowers and fruit appears in several of Paul Cezanne\u2019s other paintings, although scholars do not agree about which of the artist\u2019s residences housed this piece of furniture. As is typical of Cezanne\u2019s work, the painting is carefully considered and the composition hard won: the traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left and near the vase attest to the artist\u2019s changing opinion as he struggled to make the arrangement work. Even in the final version, there remains a tense spatial relationship between the objects, which seem to float in the picture plane rather than being anchored to the tabletop.</p>\n",
