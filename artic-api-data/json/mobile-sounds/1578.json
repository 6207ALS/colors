    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Impressionist artist Gustave Caillebotte painted this picture in 1877. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: This is a wonderful view of modern life in Paris with this radiating intersection and these new boulevards that had just been constructed right around the neighborhood that Caillebotte lived in all his life. His family home was just a couple of blocks away. It\u2019s an amazing slice of life and slice is really the word you use because he\u2019s cropped the figures at the side. It has this sense of immediacy that makes it totally characteristic of Impressionism, which was about that transitory, that momentary, and the painting of modern life, which it certainly is.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: For instance, notice the fashionable new retractable umbrellas. But despite this interest in the momentary and modern, Caillebotte\u2019s approach also contains more traditional elements. He made numerous preparatory studies for this work whose scale is comparable to a grand history painting.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: Caillebotte was different from his Impressionist friends who mostly sketched with a much more open brushwork. His were firmly model forms and, yet, even though it\u2019s a much more readable way of depicting the scene the cobblestones that he shows us in the left foreground are so incredibly painterly that when you look at them you forget what they\u2019re trying to describe and you see them as these abstract shapes.</p>\n",
