    "copy": " This past year, the museum welcomed contemporary artists such as Mounira Al Solh, Peter Fischli, Andrew Lord, Cauleen Smith, and Xu Longsen into the galleries as we opened exhibitions of their work. A search through our archives yielded these images of five visitors from the past who lent their unique presence to the galleries.   Ivan Albright , in the flesh, invites comparisons to a self-portrait painted nearly 30 years earlier.   A self-possessed Georgia O\u2019Keeffe stands beside Blue and Green Music , Cow\u2019s Skull with Calico Roses , and Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth .   Though the model for The Praying Jew was dressed in the artist's father's prayer clothes, he was not related to Chagall.   The ever-dapper Salvador Dal\u00ed poses beside A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano.   Marcel Duchamp chats with curator Katharine Kuh, standing on, not descending, the Woman\u2019s Board Grand Staircase. One of the museum's most important recent acquisitions was Duchamp's Bottle Rack.
