    "short_description": "Douglas Garofalo is one of the country's leading voices in the digital pedagogy and practice of architecture. His work illustrates how these new frontiers are widening as practices fuse with other media to change the way architecture is fabricated, aestheticized, and perceived in the 21st century. Based in Chicago, Garofalo established his studio in 1987 and is one of the most prolific designers in this genre with a broad range of projects and completed works.",
