    "description": "<p>Print developed from Georges Seurat\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Final Study for \"Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\",</em> 1883, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p>The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work,&nbsp;<em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em>. Seurat\u2019s focus on a subject from modern life, his luminous palette, and his airy brushwork show how the young artist adapted characteristics of Impressionist painting for his own purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Image size:&nbsp;</strong>7.1875 x 11.5 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Poster size:&nbsp;</strong> 11 x 14 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Premium Cardstock</li>\n</ul>",
