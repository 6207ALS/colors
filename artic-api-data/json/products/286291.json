    "description": "<p><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Vasa Irregular Shape #2 is a large prismatic display of color, bright hued planes gleaming from every angle. Some years ago, Sculptor Vasa Velizar Mihich developed methods of sculpting with cast acrylic forms. Perfecting his technique over time, the artist has created a stunning, vibrant vocabulary all his own. He and his team create each piece by hand in Los Angeles CA. Signed by the artist.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>7 x 1.4 x 8 in.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">*Please note that due to the handmade nature, each product may vary in design/look/appearance.</em></p>",
