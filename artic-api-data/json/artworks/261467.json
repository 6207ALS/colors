    "description": "<p><em>[Lynching] is not the creature of an hour, the sudden outburst of uncontrolled fury, or the unspeakable brutality of an\u00a0 insane mob. It represents the cool, calculating deliberation of intelligent people who openly avow that there is an\u00a0 \u201cunwritten law\u201d that justifies them in putting human beings to death without complaint under oath, without trial by jury,\u00a0 without opportunity to make defense, and without right of appeal.</em>\u00a0<br>\u2014Ida B. Wells, \u201cLynch Law in America,\u201d 1900\u00a0</p>\n<p>Emergency calls to the police are built on lynch law. Calling the police is a request that someone be injured, arrested, incarcerated, or killed. Calling the police is participation in an authority that uses lynching as law enforcement. Descriptions given to the police provide the grounds for stops of anyone who matches them.\u00a0<br>The power of white people to enforce the law and invoke legal authority was the basis for colonial slave codes. The1740\u00a0 Slave Codes in South Carolina determined that if enslaved people did not submit to searches by white colonists, they\u00a0 could be lawfully killed. If any slave, found out of the house or plantation to which they were bound, \u201cshall refuse to\u00a0 submit or undergo the examination of any white person, it shall be lawful for any such white person to pursue, apprehend,\u00a0 and moderately correct such slave; and if any such slave shall assault and strike such white person, such slave may be\u00a0 lawfully killed.\u201d\u00a0</p>\n<p>The racist legal practice of matching a description has been practiced in the United States since its founding. Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution is known as the Fugitive Slave Clause. It dictates that any slave who absconds to a\u00a0 state that has abolished slavery does not become free, but legally remains the property of the master. The regular fugitivity\u00a0 of the enslaved caused the framers of the Constitution to prioritize the recognition, recapture, and return of enslaved\u00a0 property. The Fugitive Slave Clause was enhanced by the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793, which stipulated\u00a0 that:\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>it shall be the duty of the executive authority of the State or Territory to which such person shall have fled, to\u00a0 cause him or her arrest to be given to the Executive authority making such demand, or to the agent when he shall\u00a0 appear . . . .[A]nd upon proof to the satisfaction of such judge or magistrate, either by oral testimony or affidavit\u00a0 taken before and certified by a magistrate of any such state or territory, that the person so seized or arrested, doth,\u00a0 under the laws of the state or territory from which he or she fled, owe service or labour to the person claiming him\u00a0 or her, it shall be the duty of such judge or magistrate to give a certificate thereof to such claimant, his agent or\u00a0 attorney, which shall be sufficient warrant for removing the said fugitive from labour, to the state or territory from\u00a0 which he or she fled.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Enforcement of the fugitive slave laws allowed any Black person matching a description to be accused of being a fugitive,\u00a0 and to be drawn into or returned to slavery.\u00a0In the absence of formal slavery, the sharecropping system, the lynch mob, the Ku Klux Klan, and the professional police\u00a0 collaboratively formed a regime of racial terror intended to control the labor and life of Black people across the country.\u00a0 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, police facilitated and participated in lynch mobs. Police continue the practice of\u00a0 lynching as enforcement of the \u201cunwritten law.\u201d \u2014CR</p>\n",
