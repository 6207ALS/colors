    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A blue and white porcelain vase from China stands on a table covered in a Persian carpet in this still life by American artist Charles Dyer.  These objects display their owner's worldliness and familiarity with Eastern cultures.  Notice how the carpet has been carefully draped over the table in a decorative manner rather than laid flat on the floor.  Dyer titled this painting 17th Century Interior, perhaps an homage to 17th Century Dutch still life painters who often featured similar goods in their paintings.  But Persian carpets and Chinese porcelain remained a desirable commodity in the 19th Century.  By the 1870s, American collectors began to acquire porcelain and carpets as art objects in themselves rather than mere household furnishings.  A native Chicagoan, Dyer first worked as a diplomat in Beirut before becoming an artist, he later lived in Munich where he completed this painting in 1877.  Dyer also spend time working on his art in Syria and Egypt.  Here's Sarah Kelly, Associate Curator of American Art.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY: Dyer himself actually travelled extensively and so these are undoubtedly objects that he acquired in his travels.  This could be seen in some ways as almost a self portrait in that it shows his life as he's gathered it together.</p>\n",
