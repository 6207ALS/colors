    "copy": " Tarsila do Amaral (1886\u20131973) was a central figure at the genesis of modern art in her native Brazil, and her influence reverberates throughout 20th- and 21st-century art. This publication establishes her rich background in European modernism, which included associations in Paris with artists Fernand L\u00e9ger and Constantin Brancusi, dealer Ambroise Vollard, and poet Blaise Cendrars. Tarsila (as she is affectionately known in Brazil) synthesized avant-garde aesthetics with Brazilian subjects, creating stylized, exaggerated figures and landscapes inspired by her native country that were powerful emblems of the Brazilian modernist project known as Antropofag\u00eda. Featuring a selection of Tarsila\u2019s major paintings, this important volume traces her vital role in the emerging modern-art scene of Brazil, the community of artists and writers (including poets Oswald de Andrade and M\u00e1rio de Andrade) with whom she explored and developed a Brazilian modernism, and how she was subsequently embraced as a national cultural icon. At the same time, an analysis of Tarsila\u2019s legacy questions traditional perceptions of the 20th-century art world and asserts the significant role that Tarsila and others in Latin America had in shaping the global trajectory of modernism.
