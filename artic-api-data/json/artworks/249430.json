    "description": "<p>When Magnum photo agency member Susan Meiselas moved to New York\u2019s Little Italy in the mid-1970s, she was noticeably different from the neighborhood\u2019s existing residents: not Italian, single, and an artist. One day a group of neighborhood girls reflected sunlight into Meiselas\u2019s face while she was riding her bicycle. This small rebellious act led to a decades-long friendship and an extended photographic series, <em>The Prince Street Girls</em>. Meiselas documented the girls testing models of womanhood, as in this image of three posing in laced wedge sandals and jean shorts against a backdrop of graffiti and neglected buildings. Years later, the series stands as a testament to a grittier city in which children nevertheless roamed freely and an ethnic culture lost to assimilation and gentrification\u2014told through the particular experience of girls.</p>\n",
