    "description": "<p>Andrea Fraser is a performance and video artist who has been regarded primarily as a pioneer of &quot;institutional critique,&quot; since she structures her work around existing museum practices and protocols such as gallery talks and welcome speeches. Although they often begin rationally, her performances progressively unravel, frequently devolving into discussion of eccentric topics or performances of taboo behaviors. Spanning more than a decade, the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/106766\">five works in the Art Institute's collection</a> are among Fraser's earliest and most influential creations.<br><em>Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk</em> documents Fraser's use of an invented persona\u2014a formally attired, uptight docent named Jane Castleton\u2014to present a social history of the art museum that focuses, as one scholar described it, on the &quot;relationships between class and taste, private philanthropy and public policy.&quot;[1] The work was the first of its kind and remains a landmark in the recent history of performance art.</p>\n<p>[1]Yilmaz Dziewior, <em>Andrea Fraser: Works, 1984 to 2003</em>, exh. cat.
