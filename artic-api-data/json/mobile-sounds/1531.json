    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Does this little statue look familiar? It's the model for the much larger version, which stands 35 feet tall, on top of the historic Chicago Board of Trade building, on LaSalle Street. It's an example of the art deco style, a sleek, streamlined aesthetic of the 1920s. When the sculptor John Storrs received this commission, he recalled.</p>\n<p>JOHN STORRS: &quot;I had two major points to consider. First, I wanted my work to be in architectural harmony with the building. Second, I wanted it to be symbolical of the business. The first point I have accomplished through treating the subject in an extremely modern manner. The vertical lines of the building are retained in the lines of the statue. Because of the great height at which it will stand, the outline of a woman's figure is suggested, rather than rendered exactly.&quot;</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  To symbolize the business carried out at the Board of Trade, the artist chose Ceres, the Roman goddess of the harvest. In one hand she holds a sheaf of wheat, in the other a bag of grain. Both refer to the building's function as the world's most important food trading market. The larger statue, made of aluminum, stands 600 feet above the sidewalk. Until 1965, it was the tallest point in Chicago.</p>\n",
