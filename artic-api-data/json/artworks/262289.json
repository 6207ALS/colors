    "description": "<p>McNally and Quinn, a Chicago-based architecture firm, built its reputation designing elegant apartment buildings in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood in the 1920s. It managed to survive the Depression on very small jobs but the partnership dissolved in 1939. In the burgeoning years of highway construction after World War II, Quinn established his new firm as a leader in the design of highway bridges and expressways for the City of Chicago. The collection presents a comprehensive view of both of Quinn\u2019s partnerships, providing insight into the evolving practice of architecture through six decades. The collection includes correspondence, accounting and staff ledgers, architectural and engineering drawings documenting the complete design development and construction phases of numerous projects, product literature, reports, personal and professional photographs, and film.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/McNally%20and%20Quinn%20Records/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/McNally%20and%20Quinn%20Records/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/McNally%20and%20Quinn/field/creato;%20additi;%20contri/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Find all McNally and Quinn digital images.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
