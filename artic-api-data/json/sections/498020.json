With the right name recognition, Romans could improve their chances of being elected to high office. The celebration of the deeds of one\u2019s ancestors was therefore an increasingly common coin type from the Second Punic War (218\u2013201 B.C.) onward, when social disruptions caused by the war opened the way for increasingly volatile politics in Republican Rome. Commemoration of one\u2019s forefather\u2019s deeds and even \u201cportraits\u201d of those forefathers (with strong family resemblance to the living moneyer, naturally) were quite acceptable to Romans, whose religious beliefs included ancestor worship.\n\nThe obverse of this coin bears the \u201cportrait\u201d of the moneyer\u2019s ancestor Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who in 208 B.C. conquered the Carthaginian-held city of Syracuse in Sicily (symbolized by the triskeles behind his head). Marcellus was then consul for the fifth time in Rome, a fact blazoned on the reverse of the coin (COS QVINQ[ue]). The image on the reverse, however, celebrates an earlier great deed of this ancestor, the conquest in 222 B.C. of Viridomarus, chief of the Gallic Insubres, who were ravaging the Po valley in northern Italy. The defeat of the Insubres was deemed so valuable to Rome that Marcellus was allowed to emulate Rome\u2019s founder, Romulus, in dedicating the spolia opima (\u201cbest loot,\u201d the fallen chief\u2019s armor) to the god Jupiter. It was the third and final such dedication of spolia opima in Republican history. In this image, Marcellus carries the armor of the defeated Gaul into the temple of Jupiter Feretrius. Reflecting Roman piety, his head is draped in a fold of his toga.\n\nThe moneyer himself, P. Cornelius Lentulus Marcellinus (his name appears on the obverse) is not very well known. He was, however, a close relative of three politicians who agitated against Julius Caesar and who were consuls, in turn, in 51, 50, and 49 B.C.: C. Claudius Marcellus Major and M. Claudius Marcellus (brothers) and their cousin C. Claudius Marcellus Minor: the Marcellus depicted on this coin is their direct ancestor. The moneyer is also related by adoption to Marcellus Major\u2019s coconsul in 49 B.C., L. Cornelius Lentulus. It is unknown to what degree the choice of the events depicted on this coin was influenced by the political aspirations of these family members; this coin may be part of a campaign to win Sicilian support as tensions rose between Caesar and Pompey. It was at any rate a reminder to the Roman people that Julius Caesar was not the only Roman who could conquer the Gauls.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Romulus\u2019s defeat of an enemy king in single combat was the first, in 752 B.C.; Aulus Cornelius Cossus held the second honor, by killing the king of the Etrurians at Veii in about 428 B.C.; these two events are both more or less legendary: see Flower, \u201cTradition of the Spolia Opima,\u201d pp. 34\u201335.\n\nOriginally named Claudius Marcellus, he took the name Marcellinus after being adopted into the family of the Cornelii Lentuli; such adoptions for political or commercial purposes were common in Rome.\n\nKopij, \u201cPropaganda over Sicily?,\u201d esp. 176\u201377.
