Braude Memorial Collection, 2013.976\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew the composition directly in pen and glossy, black ink, with no preliminary sketch, on ivory wove paper. He used a metal-nibbed dip pen that held a limited amount of ink and chose to draw on the less-textured, felt side of the wove paper sheet, which provided a smooth surface for his pen to move across. Matisse captured the organic structure of the flowers and stems with fluid, sweeping pen lines made possible by the smooth paper surface (see fig. 44.1). There are very few long lines, such as the arcing pen stroke defining the tabletop, in this work. There is some variety in the depth and width of the black ink lines, resulting from variation in the pressure Matisse applied to his pen and the amount of ink it held. The darkest lines in the flowers at the center were drawn with the pen freshly dipped in ink. Finer, fainter lines, such as those describing the pattern in the sitter\u2019s top, were drawn as the ink ran low. Matisse established the composition right up to the edges of the sheet. The sheet dimensions are original. There are multiple pinholes at the top corners, which likely indicate he tacked the paper to a board as he drew or to a wall afterward.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri Matisse 37 (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 44.2).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. The ink is dense and glossy, indicating the presence of a resinous binder. The gloss is accentuated when viewed at an angle.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper (discolored to cream). There is a fine screen pattern on the verso (fig. 44.3). The top and bottom edges have deckle edges. The right and left edges are imitation deckle edges, indicating that the paper is moldmade. This sheet retains its original dimensions and was not cut down. There is a watermark in the upper right corner: Arches (1.5 \u00d7 5.5 cm) (fig. 44.4). There is a countermark located at the upper left corner of the intertwined initials: \u201cM\u201d and \u201cB\u201d (2.5 \u00d7 2.4 cm) (fig. 44.5).\n\n56.5 \u00d7 45.3 cm (22 3/8 \u00d7 17 7/8 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2015 to reduce mottled discoloration, foxing, mat-burn stains along the perimeter, and surface soil.\n\nThere is faint mottled yellow discoloration throughout. The ink is in good condition.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from the artist by Williamina Meyer de Schauensee (n\u00e9e Williamina Wemyss Wentz, Dec. 26, 1905\u2013Dec. 1989), Devon, Penn., 1948 (after Apr. 3)\u2013Dec. 1989.\n\nBy descent to the Estate of Williamina Meyer de Schauensee, from Dec. 1989.\n\nAcquired by unidentified private collector.\n\nSold at Sotheby\u2019s New York, lot 311, to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (c. 1921\u2013Jan. 5, 2015), Chicago, May 12, 1994\u2013June 19, 2013.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 19, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, International Water Color Exhibition: Eighteenth Year, Mar. 23\u2013May 14, 1939, cat. 48 (ill.), as Girl and Flowers.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Henri Matisse: Retrospective Exhibition of Paintings, Drawings, and Sculpture, Apr. 3\u2013May 10, 1948, cat. 137 (ill.), as Study for \u201cAnemones and Woman, Harmony in Blue,\u201d 1937.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia Collects 20th Century, Oct. 3\u2013Nov. 17, 1963, no cat. no., as Study for \u201cAnemones and Woman, Harmony in Blue,\u201d 1937.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K.
