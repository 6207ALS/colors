The images were drawn on transfer paper, and upon Whistler\u2019s return to Paris in early September, they were sent to London to be put on stone and printed by the Ways. Like Vitr\u00e9: The Canal (cat. 63), this lithograph is an early instance of Whistler\u2019s use of a stumping pencil to apply crayon estompe directly to transfer paper. Here the artist used the technique to suggest wisps of cloud in the sky. Overall, the image\u2014like the other Brittany subjects\u2014displays a boldness and vigor that distinguish it from Whistler\u2019s earlier lithographs as well as from etchings of the late 1880s of similar rustic subjects (such as K 380, 384, 394), demonstrating the relative ease with which the artist could use the lithographic crayon to suggest nuances of texture, light and shadow, and atmospheric effect.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (368 \u00d7 245 mm), signed.
