    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This 17th century cabinet is a marvel of fine craftsmanship with many surprises inside.  Behind the elaborate external, with its graceful flourishes of carved ivory, lie even more exquisite wonders awaiting discovery by the curious viewer.  Take a moment to walk around the cabinet.  As you do, remember that this usually would have been seen with its doors closed, not open, as it is here.  The decoration becomes richer the deeper you go.  The front doors open to reveal carved figures on pedestals, bronze drawer pulls shaped like lions' heads, and ivory pictures depicting hunting scenes.  The dominant theme is hunting with falcons using 17th century weaponry such as crossbows, nets, and firearms.  There are also mythological scenes.  The central panel shows Icarus, the mythical Greek boy who tried to fly to the sun on wings held together by wax, only to fall to his death when the wax melted.  At the very top of the cabinet, look for the ivory figure which represents the Christian virtue of charity.  Constructed in Augsburg, Germany around 1660, the cabinet is a highly functional object as well as a beautiful one.  With all its hidden drawers and compartments, it served as, among other things, a safe deposit box, a medicine cabinet, and a jewelry box.  The nobleman or wealthy merchant who owned such a lavish cabinet would have invited fellow connoisseurs to explore its inner riches with him.  You can discover all the secrets of the interior virtually through the iPad in front of the case.</p>\n",
