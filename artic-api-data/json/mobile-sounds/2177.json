    "transcript": "<p>NEWS CLIP:  Racial and religious intolerance has become a critical problem. Even in this land so blessed in its doctrine of equal human rights.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  Joe Jones shows us that the great migration was not the salve for all of society\u2019s woes and that a hatred and the racism of the era were going to follow some of those families as they moved up north.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  Joe Jones\u2019s \u201cAmerican Justice\u201d shows a house being torn down, an African-American woman who\u2019s probably been raped and hanged and the Ku Klux Klan. In 1932 the number of lynching\u2019s in this country rose to an all-time high.</p>\n<p>ANNELIST MADSEN:  So this lynching scene takes place in Indiana.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  One of the other kind of hard truths of the picture is that at least Americans in the north can\u2019t dismiss this kind of activity as something that happens in the South.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  The Ku Klux Klan was the strongest in border states like Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Missouri. And that\u2019s because in those areas blacks and whites were competing for unskilled jobs and the whites were threatened by that.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY OEHLER:  If Aaron Douglas is all about the aspiration of his people Joe Jones point out the reality of the existence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  People were horrified by Joe Jones\u2019s painting. They found that such violence they didn\u2019t think that was appropriate for art. And Jones, of course, said, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d  He said, \u201cLook at all of the crucifixions and the violence in religious painting that we accept as beautiful and yet they\u2019re depicting horrific events.\u201d So he wasn\u2019t having it.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY OEHLER:  Like the Ben Shahn, like a number of paintings in this in this exhibition, it represents how artists channel their anger through their art, how they channel their anxieties about American society. And had very blunt and straightforward ways of dealing with it in their painting.</p>\n",
