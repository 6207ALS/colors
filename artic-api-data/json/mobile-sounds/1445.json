    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This remarkable granite sculpture depicts Shanmukha, a form of the Hindu god Kartikeya. Madhuvanti Ghose.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: We know Kartikeya by various names. He is sometimes called Kumara because of the fact that he was a young prince. He was the son of the goddess Parvati or Durga and the great god Shiva. And his brother was the elephant-headed Ganesh. Kartikeya had a complicated childhood where he was brought up by six mothers, the Krttik\u0101\u2019s or the Pleiades and that is why in order to drink the milk from these six mothers he has six heads which you can see by walking around the sculpture. The sculpture is in the round and it\u2019s worth taking a walk around it to view it from all sides.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The god also has six pairs of arms.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: And his various arms which hold these weapons indicate that he was a great warrior. In fact, he was the commander in chief of the armies of the gods. Shanmukha sits in the royal posture with one leg raised. He rides on his traditional vehicle a peacock. The bird holds a snake in its mouth symbolizing victory over evil.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE:  His right hand is raised in the \u201cdo not fear\u201d or Abhaya mudra while his left is lowered in the Varada mudra or the hand gesture that denotes \u201cgiving\u201d to his worshipers. It\u2019s a gesture that indicates that he is granting people\u2019s requests.</p>\n",
