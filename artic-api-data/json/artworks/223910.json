    "description": "<p><a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/20027/gordon-parks\">Gordon Parks</a> relocated from Minnesota to Chicago\u2019s South Side in 1940, immersing himself in the local art community while operating a portrait studio out of the South Side Community Art Center. In 1941 he was awarded a Rosenwald Fellowship for a portfolio of photographs he created on the South Side; the award gave him the means to move east to Washington, DC. By 1948 <em>Life</em> magazine hired him as its first African American staff photographer.</p>\n<p>In 1963 Parks returned to Chicago on assignment for <em>Life</em> to report on the Nation of Islam, newly headquartered in the city. Parks gained unprecedented access to this radical civil rights movement through his friendship with Malcolm X, who arranged a meeting with Elijah Muhammad, the group\u2019s leader, so that Parks could obtain permission to proceed with the story. Parks spent weeks with the Black Muslim community, documenting a range of its activities\u2014from self-defense training to religious services led by Malcolm X.</p>\n<p>Parks\u2019s photo-essay ran in the May 31, 1963, issue of <em>Life</em>, along with an essay by Parks that reflects on his dual status as insider and outsider. The text begins with his return to Chicago after nearly a decade and his memories of \u201cthe hopelessness that seeped into the black souls of that jungle.\u201d Parks goes on to describe his current position: \u201cI was a Black Man in White Man\u2019s clothing, sent by the very \u2018devils\u2019 [Elijah Muhammad] criticized so much. . . . I wondered whether or not my achievements in the white world had cost me a certain objectivity.\u201d He concludes, \u201cI sympathize with much of what they say, but I also disagree with much of what they say. . . . Nevertheless, I acknowledge that the circumstance of common struggle has willed us brothers.\u201d</p>\n",
