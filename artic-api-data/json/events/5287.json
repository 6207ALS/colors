Galvanized by Locks\u2019s conceptualizing, poeticizing, and guiding vision, the contributors come from all facets of the diverse wellspring of Black artistic excellence in Chicago, bringing their unique perspectives and experiences to uplifting, anthemic, and highly animated musical performance.</p><p>&nbsp;Damon Locks and Black Monument Ensemble\u2019s new album <em>NOW</em> was created in the final throes of Summer 2020, following months of pandemic-induced fear and isolation, the explosion of social unrest, struggle and violence in the streets, and as the certain presence of a new reality fully settled in. Set up safely in the garden behind Chicago\u2019s Experimental Sound Studio, the music was recorded in only a few takes, capturing the first times members of BME had ever played or sang the tunes. For Locks, the impetus was more about getting together to commune and make art than it was about producing an album. In his words: \u201cIt was about offering a new thought. It was about resisting the darkness. It was about expressing possibility. It was about asking the question, \u2018Since the future has unfolded and taken a new and dangerous shape ... what happens NOW?\u2019\u201d</p><p><strong>About avery r. young</strong></p><p>Interdisciplinary artist @avery_r_young is also an award-winning teaching artist who has been an Arts and Public Life Artist-In-Residence at the University of Chicago.
