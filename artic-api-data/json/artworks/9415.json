At a time when shoddy manufacturing characterized textile production in the wake of the Industrial Revolution, this richly colored and beautifully designed panel which was created by the newly invented technique of roller-printing, attests to the high standards of design and fabrication achieved at the Lancaster works.</p>\n",
