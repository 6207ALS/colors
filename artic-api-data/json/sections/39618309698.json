Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat. (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, 2013), pp. 195\u201398, 221, no. 20. Also see Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Salon d\u2019Automne, Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, dessin, gravure, architecture et art d\u00e9coratif, exh. cat. (Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des Papiers-Monnaie, 1906), cat. 149.\n\nWhen Durrio loaned his Gauguin collection to the 1928 Kunsthalle Basel exhibition (see Exhibition History), he received a deposit of 100,000 francs as a guarantee for the return of his collection. Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

Tahitian Idol\u2014the Goddess Hina appears in the inventories of Geiser (no. 86-106, Jan. 18, 1931, Holzschnitte, and no. 68\u201389, Dec. 24, 1931, as Gravures sur bois, all listed as a set of woodcuts); photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. The collection was purchased in Basel after Durrio failed to return the cash deposit on the works loaned for the 1928 exhibition. Walther Geiser\u2019s collector stamp on verso (not in Lugt).\n\nGeiser, who purchased the collection, consigned it to Lucas Lichtenhan for sale on January 18, 1931, as written out in a signed contract; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGeiser, as owner of the collection, consigned it to Lucas Lichtenhan for sale on January 18, 1931, but the print did not sell so it was returned to Geiser after they terminated their contract in 1936. Photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe Paco Durrio, and later Walther Geiser, woodcuts in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago have inscriptions on the verso that were deciphered as the order they were exhibited and presented in the catalogue for the 1906 Salon d\u2019automne exhibition at the Grand Palais de Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. This print is inscribed with the number 14, the fourteenth print in the \u201cGravures sur bois\u201d section of the exhibition, which corresponds to entry no. 149, \u201cNoa-Noa.\u201d\n\nThere are two editions of this exhibition catalogue. In the first edition, the exhibition dates are listed as July\u2013August 1928, and the Art Institute\u2019s painting is given as cat. 103.
