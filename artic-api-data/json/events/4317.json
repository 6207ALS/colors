    "description": "<p><strong>The topic for this month's Intersections is Justice.</strong></p><p>The Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was recently closed. Since 2017 the investigation has sparked intense debate about the complex, and often troubling, relationship between power and justice in America. This month\u2019s Intersections conversation will reflect on artwork that asks its own questions about justice: what it is, what it means to each of us, and when it matters.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.</p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs, offered on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
