    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Spanish artist Joaquim Sorolla's &quot;Images of Children on the Beach&quot; were among his best-loved paintings.  Here, the older girl shades her eyes from the brilliant Spanish sun, which reflects rosily on her face.  Her younger sister, clutching her shift, looks down with the light at the water swirling around her feet.  Drawing upon Impressionist techniques, Sorolla fills the painting with light and movement.  The older girl's gown billows in the wind and catches the sun dazzlingly, and the rushing waves of the Mediterranean are evoked with large, swift, paint-laden brushstrokes.  They brighten almost to translucency in the foreground, where a reflective layer of shifting water covers the sand.  Joaquin Sorolla's work was well known in the United States as well as in Europe.  In 1907 he met Archer Milton Huntington, a notable art patron.  With his help, Sorolla's work was exhibited in many major American institutions.  These instituted the Art Institute to Chicago, where his work was shown in 1911.  This painting was acquired from that exhibition by a museum patron and has been here at the Art Institute ever since.</p>\n",
