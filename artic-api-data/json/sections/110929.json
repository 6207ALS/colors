At some point the crown of thorns was rubbed away; the shako (the military hat worn by the Belgian civil guard) is a later addition, added in a slightly darker black colored pencil or crayon (possibly Cont\u00e9; see fig. 2; see \u201cEnsor\u2019s Panache\u201d for more on the shako and other military headgear of Ensor\u2019s time). Although difficult to read under normal conditions, the crown of thorns is identifiable with the aid of infrared reflectography (see fig. 3). Additional strokes emphasize the beard and some outer strands of hair. A monstrance, or ostensorium (used to display the consecrated host), extends to either side of Christ\u2019s face (sheets 3D and 3F).
