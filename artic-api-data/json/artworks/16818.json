    "description": "<p>Philip Beam has identified the site for <em>Prout\u2019s Neck, Breaking Wave</em> as \u201cthe shoreline a little above water\u2019s edge in the vicinity of Cannon Rock, looking toward High Cliff,\u201d adding that Homer \u201cfished from this point almost daily during the summer and fall and must have seen such waves &quot;a thousand times&quot; (Beam 1966, n.p.). Homer\u2019s familiarity with the site is born out by the techniques that he used to capture the relentless churning movement of the massive wave. Although he used very little graphite in this work, he mapped out the frothy whites of the wave by making staccato marks with <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#resist\">resist</a>, probably using <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#chalkresist\">chalk</a> for this purpose. Homer used almost every trick he knew to achieve the varied textures of water, shore, and sky, including layering, blotting, rewetting, and scraping. Although carefully planned and carried out, the final effect is vigorous and immediate.</p>\n",
