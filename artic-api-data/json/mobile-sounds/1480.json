    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the mid-1960s Donald Judd began making what would become his signature sculptures commonly referred to as \u201cStacks\u201d. He created this stack in 1968 after he had firmly established the compositional rules of his series.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: Each stack includes ten identical units, these sort of box like forms. The boxes are always the exact same size. And the distance between them is always equal to the height of each box unit itself. So there\u2019s a real exactitude here, a real meticulousness of installation.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: To eliminate all traces of the artist\u2019s hand Judd had them commercially fabricated. The boxes are made from stainless steel with amber Plexiglas tops and bottoms. Subtly shifting effects of light lend the work a mysterious jewel like appearance.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: You can see shadows scattered almost 360 degrees around this kind of columnar or spine-like form across the wall filling in the space in between the boxes and expanding the stack outward against the wall. The shadows, if the light is strong, can be particularly orange. They can be much paler. They can almost seem to push towards a kind of yellow or pink, again, depending on the quality of light and depending on how you approach the work. To experience this work is to have a really physical encounter with it and to appreciate the lushness of the materials that he\u2019s chosen, even the sleekness of industrial fabrication contributes to that sense of lushness.</p>\n",
