Energetic and fluid, they record unexpected poses and unusual viewpoints that depart from any established European art-historical precedents.</p>\n<p>A contemporary described Rodin\u2019s method: \u201cEquipped with a sheet of paper . . . and a graphite pencil . . . he gets his model to strike a more or less unstable pose, then draws quickly without taking his eyes off the model. The hand roams haphazardly, the pencil often runs off the page. . . . Not once does [he] look at it. This snapshot of movement is taken in less than a minute.\u201d</p>\n",
