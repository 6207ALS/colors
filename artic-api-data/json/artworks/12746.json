    "description": "<p>The standing male figure is found throughout Songye statuary art. The <em>mankishi</em> (singular <em>nkishi</em>) served both as community guards and as private devotional objects. The community-based <em>mankishi<em> are generally larger in scale and relatively consistent in their stylistic qualities, whereas the personal ones are quite small\u2014ranging between four and forty centimeters\u2014and are aesthetically diverse. Despite such heterogeneity, there are several features that are nonetheless found in many of the personal <em>mankishi</em> and that are evident in the example here, including a protruding or swollen stomach on which the figure\u2019s hands rest, a large head in relation to the body, and copper or brass nails embellishing the face and head.</p>\n<p>This nkishi is barely 16 centimeters in height, but with its powerful expression and the emphasis on the head and abdomen, it appears much larger through its visual impact. The carved genitals indicate that this is a male figure, despite the small breasts. The breasts, in addition to the swollen stomach, may suggest the relevance of these objects to fertility. Alan Merriam has suggested that the explicit carving of genitals may have indicated the desired gender of the owner\u2019s first-born child. These personal sculptures were intimate expressions of individual hopes, anxieties, and life goals. The holes bored into the figure\u2019s face, head, and stomach were most likely plugged with copper or brass nails or tacks, as demonstrated by other examples. The cavity in the stomach was the site for the insertion of medicinal or ritual substances. Once they are commissioned and carved, a ritual specialist called an <em>nganga</em> would activate the <em>mankishi</em> (see also 1957.289).</p>\n",
