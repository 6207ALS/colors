    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: The shapes in this painting are very similar to some of the shapes that we see in the rest of this gallery. They\u2019re forms that are abstract and unusual. They have an organic quality to them. They come from the imagination. They almost seem to be growing.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This painting is by the Spanish surrealist artist Joan Mir\u00f3.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: It\u2019s a picture that in many ways is not that lyrical and not that beautiful and that was okay for Mir\u00f3. This was a moment in surrealism and in Mir\u00f3\u2019s painting where he really wanted to destroy the tradition of painting. In fact, he used the word \u201cassassinate\u201d. He wanted to assassinate painting, meaning he wanted to start fresh and make something that came from a new place. He used the idea of automatism, meaning actions that are done automatically, just like we doodle when we\u2019re maybe talking on the phone. Mir\u00f3 didn\u2019t just look to the unconscious to be the source of a work like this, he also sought out the untraditional in terms of techniques and media. What we\u2019re looking at is a piece of Masonite. It\u2019s a rough man-made material and on that background he painted this image and added to oil paint gravel and dust and stones. And that rough, unexpected quality is very much what Mir\u00f3 was after. And how ironic then that he would call it \u201cpainting.\u201d</p>\n",
