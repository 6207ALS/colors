Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThis wood-block print is part of a series of fifteen thematically related works inspired by works that Gauguin did previously in Brittany and Tahiti. They include individual images that can be displayed in a narrative sequence and/or presented edge to edge in a frieze-like arrangement. Gauguin left no instructions as to how to display the fifteen prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after the artist\u2019s death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \u201cHouse of Pleasure\u201d in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Thus Gauguin seems to have used three sets of the suite to embellish his living quarters. The repetition of images this allowed reflects a time-honored principle of interior decoration exemplified by the repeats found in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThis print depicts the interior of an elliptical Tahitian building intended for communal gatherings (see fig. 92.1). The structure\u2019s large scale is underscored by the cluster of small figures gathered at the center of the distant wall, in contrast to the large figures in the foreground. Streaks of light penetrate the space\u2019s bamboo walls. A brilliant shaft of light, pouring through an unseen opening at the right, separates near from far. In the right foreground, a squatting figure leans toward a dog that turns its head in her direction. Extending across the bottom of the image is a hooded, sleeping figure lying on a form that is too large to be read as a conventional pillow. It bears Gauguin\u2019s monogram, while the oval shape below contains the number of the impression (23 in cat. 92.1 and 7 in cat. 92.2). An unidentifiable form, perhaps crumpled fabric, lies next to the sleeper.\n\nThis wood-block print is a direct translation, albeit reversed by the printing process, of a watercolor, House of Songs, pasted onto page 63 of Gauguin\u2019s 1893\u20131901 bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 92.2). The components of both images are nearly the same, except that the print includes a dog not in the watercolor, the watercolor includes a small seated figure at the upper right not in the print, and the space between the figures in the foreground and background differs. Finally, the large shape in the watercolor on which the recumbent figure rests is not as articulated as its counterpart in the print, and the heap of what may be cloth in the foreground of the print is absent in the watercolor. Despite the challenges of transferring the various elements of watercolor into a wood-block print, the artist achieved an almost one-to-one relationship between the two works, as confirmed by tracings of the individual parts of the former superimposed over the latter (fig. 92.3).\n\nGauguin first took up the theme of the watercolor and print in the 1892 oil painting Te fare hymenee (House of Songs) (fig. 92.4 [W 477, Field 1977 22]), in which a large number of Tahitians sit, stand, and sleep in an expansive interior with walls and a ceiling similar to those of the later print. The print\u2019s reclining female, draped in white, is found in the bottom center of the painting, while the squatting figure appears behind the standing male at the left. Two sleeping people are the subject of a painting of the same year, Moe moea (The Dream) (fig. 92.5). A single sleeper appears in yet another 1892 painting, Reclining in Candlelight.\n\nGauguin\u2019s recumbent females were informed by a figure in a fresco by a follower of Giotto, of which Gauguin owned a photograph (fig. 92.6). Such a recumbent woman features prominently in Te po (The Night), plate 2 of the 1894\u201395 Noa Noa Suite (see fig. 92.7). The artist pasted a fragment of Te po onto page 60 of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 92.8).\n\nGauguin\u2019s 1891\u201393 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook) features two studies in graphite related to the squatting figure at the left of the watercolor House of Songs (fig. 92.9). The same sketchbook contains an image in graphite, heightened with watercolor, of a group of seated figures not unlike those in the watercolor (fig. 92.10). Another page in this sketchbook depicts figures in repose that relate to both the watercolor and the painting Te fare hymenee (House of Songs) (fig. 92.11). An independent watercolor records a similar reclining group (fig. 92.12).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.
