Robinson, 1949.1129\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent amethyst and colorless glass with a brown tinge. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rounded rim tapers to a solid horizontal rib forming a vertical collared rim then constricts to create a short, inward-tapering neck. The neck spreads out into a globular body with a flattened base that retains a pontil mark. A trail of colorless glass with a brown tinge is pulled up and down from shoulder to rim ten times. For a zoomable image, see fig. 134.1.\n\nThe vessel is unweathered with a small chip in the rim and a segment of missing trail.\n\nThis color was a favorite of late Roman glassblowers along the Syro-Palestinian coast, but it must have been a more expensive jar, as amethyst glass was usually employed only as a highlight. Many more examples in the typical transparent olive-green to greenish-blue glasses are known.\n\nThe jar and its applied shoulder decoration are well-known at sites along the Syro-Palestinian coast. The color combination is more unusual. There are examples in the Princeton University Art Museum, in one of which the colors are reversed: the vessel is light green and the zigzag decoration is amethyst glass. A jar fashioned entirely of amethyst glass is in the Newark Museum, and a similar one was recently offered on the American market.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Crowfoot, Crawfoot, and Kenyon, Objects from Samaria, p. 413, no. 17, fig. 95.
