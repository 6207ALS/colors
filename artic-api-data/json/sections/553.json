Most were written to his scattered sons and to his wife and daughter at home, and they document a complex life made up of, among other things, reading, painting, printmaking, visiting exhibitions, haggling with his dealer, keeping up with old friends, visiting new ones, and writing letters. The year 1893, in which this bustling urban landscape was painted, is especially well documented, and Pissarro even referred to this particular picture in at least one of the more than thirty letters that survive from his lengthy stay at the H\u00f4tel de Rome from February 27 to May 15, 1893. A letter written on February 22 from his home in \u00c9ragny-sur-Epte, before his departure for Paris, announces his intention to paint two views from his window at the hotel, making it clear that he planned a small campaign of urban pictures even before arriving in the capital. The second letter, written the day he arrived, informs his wife that he had already begun making one work\u2014a testament to his eagerness to capture the views from his window. \u201cWhile waiting [to see Durand-Ruel] I will begin a study of the place du Havre, it\u2019s really quite beautiful.\u201d Another letter to his wife, written just days later on March 3, tells her that he has begun the second view (fig. 13.1 [PDRS 984]). These two canvases, one horizontal and the other vertical, are crucial works in Pissarro\u2019s oeuvre, because they are the formal announcement of a commitment to painting urban views that would consume almost half the artist\u2019s attention in the last decade of his life. With these two pictures Pissarro turned a corner in his career toward a pictorial embrace of the modern city, a subject that had played only a minor role up to this point in his career. The artist was then sixty-three years old.\n\nFew paintings in Pissarro\u2019s career demonstrate more vivacity than this particular work. Virtually everything, even the ordinarily stable facades of the limestone and stucco buildings, quivers in the light, and the traffic moves with liveliness. On this bright and cold day in late February, the artist observed all as they rush to their destinations. A letter of February 22 suggests that Pissarro had already inspected the hotel and chosen his room (he had stayed there many times before) for the combination of views north toward the place du Havre and east along the rue Saint-Lazare. This Second Empire street cut through northwestern Paris, linking the Gare Saint-Lazare (across the street from the hotel) with this posh, fashionable, and newly reconstructed area of Paris. The train station, already immortalized by Claude Monet in his 1877 series of paintings (fig. 13.2 and fig. 13.3; see also Monet\u2019s Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare (1877; see cat. 16 in Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago), connected Paris with the northern French regions of Normandy and Brittany, particularly the port cities of Le Havre and Dieppe\u2014all places where Pissarro had already been painting, or was about to paint, some of his last series. He had caught a train (on the Dieppe line) from the local station of Gisors, less than three miles from his comfortable house in \u00c9ragny. This journey to Paris took several hours then; it would take less than an hour today. The choice of this first setting for his cityscape series was evidently most convenient: all he had to do was to walk across the place du Havre to his hotel, greet its owner, Madame Garnier, and go to his room to paint.\n\nPissarro had made important representations of Rouen and Paris prior to 1893, but these are such rarities in his oeuvre that they still startle knowledgeable viewers familiar with his profoundly rural art from the 1870s and 1880s. One precedent for The Place du Havre, Paris\u2014and the only one in a public institution that has received ample attention\u2014is a major pastel of 1880 that is of the same size, and that appeared in the 1881 Impressionist exhibition (fig. 13.4). These two works are, in effect, representations of similar subject matter. Although they depict different parts of Paris, differ in medium, and were created during two distinct phases of Pissarro\u2019s career, both The Place du Havre, Paris and Boulevard Rochechouart represent light on an urban boulevard on a cold winter day. The latter work is among Pissarro\u2019s largest and most ambitious pastels from the first decade of Impressionism, and it is so accomplished that one wonders why the artist didn\u2019t pursue this medium further. Painted from the garret apartment he rented as a pied-\u00e0-terre, it is a work that, despite its gestural assurance, represents long hours of observation and adjustment. The view is so accurately depicted that one gets the sense of leaning on the window ledge looking down at the busy street. It lacks the vivacity of the later painting but also projects a wonderfully accurate sense of a slightly damp winter day in Paris. Pissarro shows an omnibus, a horse cart, and two horse-drawn (or Hassam) cabs, as well as a small group of pedestrians making their way across and around the median of the boulevard Clichy in the frigid air.\n\nWhen Pissarro tackled this view from his winter perch in his hotel, he looked down on an intersection with so much more traffic of every kind than the boulevard Rochechouart that it must have been a challenge for him to compress his observations into a single image. Though one can identify as many as twenty figures in the 1880 pastel, one quickly tires of counting in the Chicago painting, so numerous, tiny, and summarily drawn are the figures and vehicles. In addition, if Pissarro managed to make the boulevard Clichy seem slightly smaller than it is, his place du Havre seems larger in representation than it is in reality. By dramatically reducing the scale of all the elements in both the foreground and background of the picture so that they are smaller than they would appear if one were actually looking out the window, Pissarro managed to make the city appear even larger and more action-filled than it was. He was also struggling\u2014but in a good sense\u2014with his technique. He had already abandoned Pointillism by 1890, but he still grappled with incorporat his knowledge of Neo-Impressionist color and light theory into his painting without being a slave to the dot. The artist\u2019s newly relaxed facture combines the gestural liveliness of his painterly approach of 1881\u201383 with the chromatic variety of Neo-Impressionism, creating a pictorial field that could never have been achieved with pastel and far surpasses in visual excitement his chromatically simple colored chalk work of 1880 (see fig. 13.5).\n\nAstoundingly, The Place du Havre, Paris, unlike many Impressionist paintings in public collections, survives on the same pre-primed canvas and stretcher on which it was made (see Support in the technical report). Given by its first owner, Bertha Honor\u00e9 Palmer, to the Art Institute, its surface was spared the more radical measure of wax or glue lining, although it has been cleaned (see Conservation History in the technical report). It quivers with life. One can see that Pissarro used a small brush and blue paint to create what can only be described as a dancing drawing, defining several static features of the composition, such as the buildings and plaza details (fig. 13.6) and a few of the larger moving elements, including the horses and carriages (see Underdrawing in the technical report). As Pissarro observed and worked from his window, he observed the theater of the city, and he added this figure, that cab, that horse, that omnibus, as the population of the urban space evolved and shifted. As he worked on the figures Pissarro went back into the setting and added touches of local and complementary colors to bring the entire picture to life. Today the place du Havre looks much the same as it did in the late nineteenth century; only the small buildings on the rue d\u2019Amsterdam have been replaced by a larger structure (see fig. 13.7 and fig. 13.8). The H\u00f4tel de Rome itself still stands (although it is now called the H\u00f4tel de Londres et de New-York), and it is even possible to ascertain from which window on the third floor Pissarro painted.\n\nWhile in Paris, after several days of running around, going to exhibitions, seeing friends, even attending the Impressionists\u2019 regular dinner with his son F\u00e9lix, Pissarro\u2019s eye began to inflame in an episode of his recurring problem with a tear-duct infection. This, combined with the flu, confined him to the interior of his hotel, as his faithful and somewhat long-suffering homeopath, Dr. Parenteau, cautioned that the cold, wind, and pollution would exacerbate his eye infection. This enforced seclusion irritated Pissarro, but it was surely good for his work, because, in addition to the two paintings he had already planned to do from his room (The Place du Havre, Paris [the Art Institute\u2019s painting; PDRS 986] and Rue Saint-Lazare: Bright Weather [fig. 13.1; PDRS 984]), he created two additional urban views. One is a tiny painting showing only the place du Havre and no architecture, one of the gems of his oeuvre (fig. 13.9 [PDRS 985]). His wife, children, and niece came to visit him, but he suffered enormously and was given silver nitrate injections as well as various chemical baths that he detailed in his letters to his wife and oldest son, Lucien.\n\nAlthough these health problems might appear to be trivial in the larger history of Pissarro\u2019s art, they are most certainly not. Indeed, his eye infections persisted to such an extent that the majority of his paintings from the last decade of his life were painted not en plein air, but from the protected vantage points of windowed interiors. For an Impressionist who valued above all the quality of immersion in the landscape, this was very difficult. He adapted well to the traditions of \u201cwindow painting\u201d that have such importance in European art but nonetheless felt as if he lost a good deal of the particularity and vivacity of observation that comes from being immersed in a scene. Pissarro also painted so many urban scenes because the views from his studio and home and in \u00c9ragny eventually became too limiting and repetitive (see fig. 13.10 [PDRS 1072] and fig. 13.11), so he sought new visual stimulus by painting in rented rooms in Dieppe, Knocke, Le Havre, Paris, Rouen, and Varangeville, among other places. His images of the rue Saint-Lazare and the place du Havre are harbingers of his new kind of painting\u2014a painting necessitated by his physical limitations. In fact, this restriction enabled Pissarro to brand a new type of \u201cseries painting\u201d with his distinct signature, possibly even offering, in his mind, products to compete with Monet\u2019s own urban series, by recording human activity in the urban realm. Rather than focusing on the symbols of industrialization as Monet had in his series by placing the train center stage in his works, Pissarro captured all of Paris\u2019s elements in equal measure, as if to say that human life itself was the essential driving force of the modern city. Both this painting and Rue Saint-Lazare: Bright Weather (fig. 13.1) made their debut at the large Pissarro exhibition at Durand-Ruel that ran from March 15 to March 30, 1893, while the painter was still in Paris. As some of the last items listed in the forty-six-painting catalogue, they were surely added at the eleventh hour.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro began with a commercially prepared support with a smooth, off-white ground. Stamps on the verso of both the stretcher and the canvas indicate the stretcher was purchased from the manufacturer Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9, while a local color merchant, P. Contet, stretched the canvas. Primary cusping seen in the weave-angle map of the vertical warp threads corroborates that the canvas was prepared in a larger, commercial setting, probably as part of a roll measuring 10 \u00d7 2 meters. With a steady hand the artist very lightly outlined the major and minor features of the composition in thin, dark-blue paint, hitting only the tops of the weave. Infrared and microscopic examination indicate that the architectural features, buggies, carriages, horses, and lampposts were all drawn prior to the painting stage, while most of the figures and details were added in the painting stage. The painting is marked by wet-in-wet application throughout, but Pissarro used fine brushes with limited mixing and working on the surface of the painting itself to avoid a muddy appearance. He executed the work in a limited number of wet-in-wet campaigns and may have used taquets bois, or spacers, to transport the work and a companion face-in to and from the spot where he worked on them. Changes, most visible in transmitted-infrared, are limited to the carriage at the lower right just above the signature (now painted out) and the entrance gate to the train station just left of the foreground lamppost. The work is currently unvarnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 13.12).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro / 93 (lower right, in green and white paint) (fig. 13.13). The signature appears to have been executed wet-in-wet with the upper layers of the background (fig. 13.14).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen.\n\nThe original size of the canvas was likely very close to its current measurements, 59.9 \u00d7 73 cm. This corresponds to a no. 20 portrait (figure) standard size (73 \u00d7 60 cm), turned horizontally. This is also the size stamped on the verso of the canvas (fig. 13.15).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 30V (0.5) \u00d7 24.1H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nAll sides of the canvas show slight cusping corresponding to original tack placement. Additionally, the weave-angle map of the vertical (warp) threads shows primary cusping, associated with commercial priming, along the left side (fig. 13.16).\n\nCurrent stretching: The work appears to have been restretched using some of the old tack holes. Additional copper tacks were added between the metal tacks at a later date for support.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The stretcher appears to be original, and is a five-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a horizontal crossbar, or a chassis \u00e0 cl\u00e9s. The mod\u00e8le d\u00e9pos\u00e9 B stamp on the crossbar is the registered trademark and patent mark of Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 (fig. 13.17). Depth: 2.0 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: black stencil  \nContent: TOILES \u00e0 PEINDRE \u00e0 COULEURS FINES / P. CONTET / PARIS / 34, Rue Lafayette, 34 (fig. 13.18)\n\nNumber  \nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: black stencil  \nContent: 20 (fig. 13.19)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: black stamp  \nContent: MOD\u00c8LE D\u00c9POS\u00c9 / &lt;B&gt; (fig. 13.20)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe commercial ground is very smooth, fills much of the weave texture, and ranges in thickness from approximately 20\u201380 \u00b5m. Cross-sectional analysis reveals that the ground consists of three layers of similar composition, probably applied in very quick succession (fig. 13.21). Pissarro left the preparation visible in select areas of the composition, especially the foreground (fig. 13.22).\n\nThe preparation appears slightly off-white, with dark particles visible in stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 13.23).\n\nAnalysis indicates the main component of the ground is lead white, with minor and trace components associated with the individual layers. The top layer contains small amounts of barium sulfate and iron oxide (brown-orange in color) with associated silicates; the middle layer, silica, silicates, and chalk (calcium carbonate); and the lower layer, silica and silicates. The binder of all layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nVery fine underdrawing in blue paint mostly visible under microscopic examination outlines the architecture and larger features, including the buildings, windows, signs, buggies, and some of the horses (fig. 13.24). The artist often painted almost to the edges of the forms, leaving the underdrawing visible in many areas. The smallest elements of the work, including most of the figures, were executed in the painting stage.\n\nThe underdrawing was executed with translucent paint and a fine brush; despite the smooth ground the drawing material only hits the tops of the weave (fig. 13.25).\n\nNo changes noted in planning/drawing stage (see Paint Layer).\n\nThe painting appears to have been executed in a few wet-in-wet campaigns. The sureness of the underdrawing led to few changes in the painting stage. The X-ray and microscopic examination indicate that each element of the drawing composition was distinctly painted, often with a small margin of exposed ground or underdrawing between the edges of forms (fig. 13.26). In some areas the particular order in which elements were painted can be discerned. For example, Pissarro summarily executed the vertical forms of the lampposts before bringing in the surrounding foreground and crowds. Even the carriage at lower center breaks around the post (fig. 13.27). The final touches and thicker impasto were added later, to visually separate the lamps and posts from the ground.\n\nThere are two areas of compositional change, most visible in transmitted-infrared. A small section of the gate around the entrance to the Gare Saint-Lazare at the far left appears to have been moved up and to the right (further back in space) of the figure and carriage. At the lower right corner changes are visible in both normal and raking light conditions (fig. 13.28). The transmitted infrared image indicates a rectangular form, likely a carriage that appears to be diagonally exiting the scene. At this stage the painting would not have featured the carriage to the left of the signature, or the figure and carriage above the signature near the left edge. The carriage heading toward the center of the scene from the right just above these features seems to have been largely present in this previous orientation, although much of the wheels and horse\u2019s hind legs were obscured. After deciding against this earlier compositional element, Pissarro painted out the diagonal carriage, adding additional background, the carriages to the left of and above the signature, the female figure, the wheels, and the horse\u2019s legs. This lower corner appears to have been changed as an almost last step, as the artist signed the work wet-in-wet with the cross-hatched background.\n\nThere are two or three holes at each corner that appear to have been created while the work was still wet (fig. 13.29). Sometimes, such holes indicate that the artist tacked the canvas to a board during execution. The color merchant stamps on the verso of the canvas and stretcher indicate a commercially prepared support, and the edges of the composition are quite cleanly executed, suggesting it was painted on the current stretcher. Holes in the corners may also indicate the use of taquets bois, or similar spacers, while painting this work. Marks left by these spacers usually appear as a round depression with a puncture at the center. In this case, it is possible that Pissarro placed his spacers so that the cylinders did not contact the paint surface. The number of pinholes, up to three in each corner, may be a rough indication of the number of painting campaigns.\n\nRelatively fine brushes overall, round and flat, with strokes up to 0.5 cm.\n\nXRF analysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, vermilion, emerald green, chrome yellow, cobalt blue, and cobalt violet.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work is currently unvarnished, in keeping with the artist\u2019s preference. A natural-resin varnish was applied in 1922 and removed in 1985; it is unclear if the work was varnished before that date. There are very light residues of natural-resin varnish in areas of impasto, and the verso has some staining from liquid or solubilized varnish seeping through cracks in the paint layer, either during application or removal.\n\nThe painting was cleaned and varnished during a 1921\u201322 treatment. The painting was examined in 1956, when it was noted to be fraying along the top edge. The work was examined again for a 1957 request for loan and noted to be varnished. The examination also recommended that the painting be lined and backed with Masonite. The work was examined again for loan in 1979; this report notes, \u201ccanvas becoming weak; should be relined.\u201d The corners were reinforced with Beva film and tissue, and tacks were added to the edges in an undocumented treatment prior to 1985. The painting was treated that year; measures included removal of a natural resin-varnish. The work was consolidated in the lower-left corner while on loan in 1993. In 2008 it also received a padded insert backing to reduce vibration in transit and support the unlined canvas.\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition, is unlined, and maintains its original stretcher. Local reinforcements to the corners (Beva and tissue) appear stable and there is no planar deformation. Small holes in the corners of the composition appear to be part of the artist\u2019s technique (see Paint Layer) and probably occurred during the painting process. There are few notable losses and some vertical cracks throughout. The work is currently unvarnished; however, residues of varnish are still present in areas of impasto. Additionally, some varnish has seeped through cracks during application or cleaning, staining the reverse (fig. 13.15). There is limited retouching, and some cotton fibers adhered to the surface of the work, presumably from the most recent cleaning, in 1985.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1998): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, Louis XIV, straight-sided ogee frame and projecting lambrequin corner and fleur-de-lis center cartouches connected by foliate scrolls with floral-bunch centers. The frame has water gilding over reddish-brown bole and recut gesso and retains its original finish with small areas of in-gilding. The ornament and cartouche fields are burnished. The carved oak moldings are mitered and joined with angled, sliding, dovetailed splines. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; ovolo with dentil; scotia side; fillet between the cartouches; ogee face with projecting lambrequin corner cartouches on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers, and fleur-de-lis center cartouches on a single-lined diamond bed with punched centers, connected by foliate scrolls with floral-bunch centers on a quadrillage bed; fillet; sanded frieze; fillet; and ogee sight molding with leaf-tip ornament on a straight-lined bed (fig. 13.30).\n\nPrevious frame (installed after 1960, removed 1998): The work was previously housed in an American, 1960/80 reproduction of a Louis XIV straight-sided ogee frame with shell center and lambrequin corner cartouches. The frame had water and oil gilding over red bole on cast plaster and gesso. The cast ornament was low in profile and rough in quality; it was cast in sections with gesso fields recut to connect the cartouches. The gilding was rough and heavily abraded and toned. The poplar and basswood moldings were assembled from premade sections and corner cartouche miters and centers, and lap-jointed and assembled on a mitered and nailed poplar back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ovolo with dentil; scotia side; fillet; three-quarter-round rail between the projecting cartouches; ogee face with shell center and lambrequin corner cartouches on double-lined diamond bed connected by a quadrillage bed; fillet; sanded frieze; fillet; and ogee sight molding with leaf-tip ornament on a straight-lined bed.\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1960): The work was previously housed in a French or American, late-nineteenth- or early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV Revival, ogee frame with deeply recessed cast plaster strapwork and floral and foliate ornament and acanthus leaves at the miters. The frame had water and oil gilding over bole on gesso and cast plaster. The molding was mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ogee with leaf-tip ornament; scotia side; ogee with strapwork and floral and foliate ornament and acanthus leaves at the miters; hollow frieze; ogee with leaf-tip ornament; cove; and fillet with a cove sight edge. This frame was similar to other frames in the Potter Palmer collection and probably dates close to when Palmer acquired the work from Durand-Ruel in 1894 (fig. 13.31).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Mar. 17, 1893.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, June 28, 1894, for $1,200.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro, Mar. 15\u201330, 1893, cat. 40, as la Place du Havre, 1893.\n\nParis, Galerie Durand-Ruel, Exposition Camille Pissarro: Tableaux, Aquarelles, Pastels, Gouaches, Mar. 3\u201321, 1894, cat. 8, as Cour du Havre.\n\nRenaissance Society of The University of Chicago, Paintings of Sea and Land and City Streets, June 8\u2013Aug. 30, 1933, cat. 3.\n\nArts Club of Chicago, Paintings by Camille Pissarro, Jan. 8\u201330, 1946, cat. 5.\n\nMontreal Museum of Fine Arts, So This Is Paris: Exhibition of Paintings (Voici Paris: Exposition de tableaux), Oct. 4\u201329, 1950, cat. 35.\n\nChicago, College of Jewish Studies, Loan Exhibition, Jan. 12\u2013Feb. 2, 1953.\n\nPark Forest (Ill.)

The Art Institute currently uses a title that is based on the one that was given to the painting when it was exhibited in 1893 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, in Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nMar. 15, 1893: La Place du Havre (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro, exh. cat.

For an English translation of some of these letters see John Rewald and Lucien Pissarro, ed., Letters to His Son Lucien, 4th ed., (Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980).\n\nFor these letters written from Paris, see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 316\u201328.

Pissarro informed his son Georges that he would have just enough time to complete two views from his window, likely in order to exhibit at his solo show, which opened less than a month later and ran from March 15 to March 30, 1893 at Durand-Ruel, Paris. In the second note to this letter Bailly-Herzberg refers to the hotel as the \u201ch\u00f4tel Garnier\u201dand points out that Pissarro painted not two but four views from his hotel window that winter. She also highlights Pissarro\u2019s statement that he had just enough time to paint two pictures from his hotel window and suggests that these are likely PDRS 984 and 986 (PV 836 and 838): the Art Institute\u2019s painting and fig. 13.1.\n\n\u201cJe vais, en attendant [Durand], commencer une \u00e9tude de la Place du Havre, c\u2019est tr\u00e8s beau.\u201d See Camille to Julie Pissarro, Paris, Feb. 27, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 317. Bailly-Herzberg identified the first painting as PV 837 and not the Art Institute\u2019s work.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s second view of the rue Saint-Lazare, see Camille to Julie Pissarro, Paris, Mar. 3, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 318. Bailly-Herzberg identified this painting as PV 836 (PDRS 984; fig. 13.1). Pissarro also mentioned the same painting (PV 836) in a letter to his son Lucien dated March 3, 1893, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, p. 317.\n\nSee Camille to Georges Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Feb. 22, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 314\u201315.\n\nThe National Gallery in London owns the smallest in the series: The Gare Saint-Lazare (1877; 53 \u00d7 72 cm).\n\nPissarro must have created the pastel now owned by the Sterlin and Francine Clark Art Institute in December 1880. In letters dated December 16 and 23, 1880, Pissarro mentions not only working in Paris since November 1880 but also that he had recently completed some pastels and sent them to his niece Esther in London to try and sell them.

Joachim Pissarro to Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn Le Courrier du Soir on April 23, 1881, society hostess and poet Nina de Villard wrote positively of the pastel at the Clark, stating that a sort of pink mist floats over the entire scene, enveloping everyone and everything, with nothing able to free itself from its weight.

When Pissarro arrived in Paris he also ran into an old friend, Georges de Bellio, also a homeopathic physician, at the doctor\u2019s favorite restaurant. Pissarro told his wife in a letter, \u201cWhen I passed along the major boulevards, de Bellio was at his restaurant, and I was thus able to get a consultation\u201d (De Bellio \u00e9tait \u00e0 son restaurant quand je passai sur les boulevards, j\u2019ai pu ainsi avoir une consultation). Pissarro didn\u2019t mention the name of the restaurant, but Dr. Bellio could often be found at the Caf\u00e9 Riche, accessible from the rue Lafitte. Camille to Julie Pissarro, Paris, Feb. 27, 1893, and Camille to Lucien Pissarro, Paris, Feb. 27, 1893, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, pp. 316\u201317. For Dr. Bellio\u2019s frequenting of the Caf\u00e9 Riche, see Anne Distel, Les collectionneurs des impressionnistes: Amateurs et marchands (Trio, 1989), p. 123. According to Distel, this restaurant was favored not only by Dr. Bellio but also by art collectors.\n\nThese two paintings were included in his March 15\u201330, 1893, show, suggesting that they were dry enough to be exhibited and hence most likely the first views that Pissarro painted from his hotel window, as he arrived in Paris on February 27, 1893, only two weeks prior to the exhibition opening. See Camille to Georges Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Feb. 22, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 314\u201315. Pissarro informed his son Georges that he would have just enough time to complete two views from his window, likely in order to exhibit at his solo show, which opened less than a month later. In the second note to this letter Bailly-Herzberg points out that Pissarro painted not two but four views from his hotel window that winter, but she asserts that the two he had just enough time to make for the show are likely the Art Institute\u2019s The Place du Havre, Paris, and Rue Saint-Lazare: Bright Weather (fig. 13.1).\n\nFor the four urban views Pissarro painted from his hotel window, see Camille to Georges Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, February 22, 1893, published in Camille Pissarro, Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, ed. Janine Bailly-Herzberg (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 314\u201315, n. 2. See also PV, 836\u201339, p. 198. According to Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s note to this same letter, PV 836, 837, 838, and 839 were executed by Pissarro from the same window of the Hotel Garnier, as the artist had enough time to complete not just the two views originally planned but four. The Art Institute\u2019s picture is no. 838, and the vertical version of almost the same size (see fig. 13.1) is PV 836. According to Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s note and PV, the two other views, PV 837 and 839, were first exhibited at Pissarro\u2019s 1894 solo show, but PDRS more recently asserts that only PV 836 and 838 (fig. 13.1 and the Art Institute\u2019s painting) were exhibited in both of Pissarro\u2019s 1893 and 1894 shows.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s treatment, including the homeopathic remedies prescribed by Dr. Parenteau, as well as the artist\u2019s family\u2019s visit, see Camille to Lucien Pissarro, Paris, April 26, 1893, April 28, 1893, and April 29, 1893; Camille to Georges Pissarro, May 1, 1893; and Camille to Julie Pissarro, May 11, 1893, published in Janine Bailly Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 321\u201328.\n\nAccording to Joachim Pissarro, Pissarro painted his series of cityscapes for a number of reasons, both positive and negative. One of the chief motivations was a desire to compete with Monet, which he mentions numerous times in his letters. The urban setting offered a perfect \u201clab\u201d in which he could put his own stamp on series paintings. Joachim Pissarro to Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. For Pissarro\u2019s stay and views of Rouen, in search of new motifs, see PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 263\u201365. Before staying in Rouen in 1896 Pissarro complained that he had had his fill of rural \u00c9ragny views painted from his second-floor studio barn, the likely instigation for the change in scenery: \u201cAfter my exhibition it is quite possible that I may leave here and find some other place to paint, because I have had my fill of these Bazincourt views, with its pretty church steeple. I need to start a new series, but where would I go? Touraine? . . . England? I don\u2019t know, but I dread going to Epping, where I hear there are high winds all year round. It\u2019s too bad.\u201d (Il est bien possible qu\u2019apr\u00e8s mon exposition je me d\u00e9cide \u00e0 aller faire quelques tableaux ailleurs qu\u2019ici, car j\u2019en ai assez des motifs de Bazincourt, avec son gentil clocher, j\u2019ai besoin de me faire une bonne s\u00e9rie nouvelle, o\u00f9 irai-je? En Touraine? . . . en Angleterre? Je n\u2019en sais rien, je crains d\u2019aller \u00e0 Epping o\u00f9, il para\u00eet, le vent r\u00e8gne en permanence, c\u2019est dommage.) See Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Feb. 18, 1894, in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 431. The exhibition that Pissarro mentioned is his solo show of 1894 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, which ran March 3\u201321, 1894.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, p. 363, which suggests that out of the forty-six paintings listed at Pissarro\u2019s 1893 solo exhibition, these two works\u2014PDRS 986 and 984, in this order\u2014have been identified as nos. 40 and 41, with the Art Institute\u2019s painting cited first.\n\nFor a discussion of commercial-canvas preparation roll sizes, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

(Skira, 2008), p. 52.\n\nSuch spacers were usually used for plein air painting, providing a method of transporting paintings between the outdoors and the studio without damaging the still-wet paint surface. In the case of the current work, it is possible that they could have been used to move the paintings between rooms during Pissarro\u2019s stay at the hotel. Similar pinholes have been found in Pissarro\u2019s Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8) and Woman and Child at the Well (1882; cat. 11). See also the discussion of taquets bois in Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists, exh. cat. (Skira, 2008), pp. 92\u201393.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly emerald green and lead white. The presence of lead, copper, and arsenic was confirmed with XRF.

The Bourgeois A\u00eene logo was also present on the stretchers from Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12) and Woman Mending (1895; cat. 15).\n\nThis stamp also appears on Pissarro\u2019s Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12), and is recorded as a transcription from Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (1894/95; cat. 14). Contet was associated with Latouche, located at 34, rue Lafayette, c. 1870\u201386. See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 64\u201365.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_1922\\_434\\_Analyitical\\_Report,\u201d June 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis is the approximate ground thickness in samples examined by SEM/EDX. The ground may have different thicknesses in areas that were not sampled. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_1922\\_434\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. Lead was identified by both XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also identified iron-oxide, silica, silicates, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_1922\\_434\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 12, 2012; and Marc Vermeulen, \u201cPsro\\_ 22\\_434\\_havre\\_XRF,\u201d Aug. 8, 2012, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nSuch spacers were usually used for plein air painting and provided a method of transporting paintings between the outdoors and the studio without damaging the still-wet paint surface. In the case of the current work, it is possible that they could have been used to move the paintings between rooms during Pissarro\u2019s stay at the hotel. Similar pinholes have been found in Pissarro\u2019s Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), Woman and Child at the Well (1882; cat. 11), and Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (1894/95; cat. 14) See also the discussion of taquets bois in Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists, exh. cat.

XRF does not detect organic pigments (including lake pigments and carbon blacks), if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (components of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Marc Vermeulen, \u201cPsro\\_ 22\\_434\\_havre\\_XRF,\u201d Aug. 8, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is possible that this painting contains the lead white and zinc white mixture found in other Pissarro works from the 1870s and 1880s. Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture has been found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. This mixture was also identified in Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3), The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), and Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892, cat. 12).\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed.

Some works, such as The Village of \u00c9ragny (1885; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford), feature a typed note from Pissarro\u2019s daughter-in-law Esther expressing both Lucien\u2019s and Camille\u2019s general distaste for varnish. On the verso of Landscape at Chaponval (1880; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), the artist wrote, \u201cplease do not varnish this picture / C. Pissarro\u201d.
