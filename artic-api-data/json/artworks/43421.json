    "description": "<p>Tanaka Shutei, a painter and print designer, created a design of an exotic pet parrot on a metal stand for the haiku poet Kyuso, who seems to have been the leader of various poetry groups.<br>In each of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=parrot&artist_ids=Tanaka+Shutei\">these three prints</a>, Kyuso chose to repeat the same basic design, although he was celebrating poetry collections by different groups on different occasions. He appears as host in every print, but he supplied a separate poem for each, and the other members were also different. The repetition of design implies that poetry hosts were not merely passive customers; they were often actively engaged in the production of prints.</p>\n",
