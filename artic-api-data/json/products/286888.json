    "description": "An affordable introduction to the key places, people and motifs in the life and art of Cezanne.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Paul Cezanne\u2019s incomparable, architectonic rendering of light and color provided the foundation of his reputation as a forerunner of modernism. Which specific locations left such vivid impressions on this scion of a provincial banker\u2019s family? What and who were the influences supporting and advancing his innovative oeuvre? In this affordable volume, acclaimed art historian James H. Rubin traces Cezanne\u2019s life and work from A to Z, creating an image of a painter who aspired to \u201cdo Poussin over again after nature.\u201d As the book's title indicates, Rubin also explicates and champions the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paul Cezanne\u2019s campaign to remove the accent on the artist\u2019s surname in accordance with its original Proven\u00e7al spelling. James H. Rubin (born 1944) is an art historian and professor at the State University of New York in Stony Brook, specializing in 19th-century art with a particular interest in French modernism.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5 x 7.75 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 120</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 40 color</li></ul>",
