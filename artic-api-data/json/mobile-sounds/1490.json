    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This seventeenth century basin was made in Mexico. Its decoration reveals a fascinating mix of influences. In the center is a cluster of fanciful buildings, these and the floral designs on the basin\u2019s outer rim are adapted from imagery on Chinese ceramics. Chinese influenced peonies decorate the basin\u2019s deep interior wall. But the surrounding dotted patterns and curved forms are derived from Islamic art. Meanwhile the basin\u2019s overall shape recalls Turkish and Egyptian pottery. How did this Mexican-made basin come to draw inspiration from opposite ends of the world? The answer lies in contemporary Mexican history. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico potters came over from Spain to work in the thriving economy of the new world. They brought with them Spanish ceramics whose Islamic inspired decoration was rooted in the Moorish occupation of southern Spain. the Mexican pottery making town of Pueblo was soon established. It lay on the Spanish trade route through the country along which were carried Chinese ceramics on their way to Europe via the Philippines. So the potters of Pueblo were able to add Chinese imagery to their international array of design influences.</p>\n",
