    "description": "<p>Disorientation can be unsettling, but it can also shed light on how we adjust to change and open the door to fresh perspectives.</p><p>\"Slow Looking: Disorientation and Change\" is an in-gallery community experience that invites participants to contribute to conversation, take part in exercises and activities, and engage in small-group discussions. Based on programs our educators lead to train physicians, medical students, and others to manage difficult transitions, confront ambiguity, and enhance empathic thinking and wellness, the conversation will use contemporary and 19th-century American artworks to consider some of the strategies all of us can use as we respond to our ever-evolving, ever-demanding world. </p><p>Learn more about the process in the article \"<a href=\"Guided Disorientation: Using Art for Civic Wellness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Guided Disorientation: Using Art for Civic Wellness</a>.\"<br><br>To learn more on the work we do with people in healthcare and legal professions, read <a href=\"https://hyperallergic.com/671020/why-connecting-legal-and-medical-professionals-to-art-is-essential/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" draggable=\"false\">\"Why Connecting Legal and Medical Professionals to Art is Essential.\"</a></p><p>If you have any questions about programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.
