While completing her undergraduate studies, Rivero joined the Art Institute of Chicago as an Andrew W. Mellon Curatorial Fellow. Through this fellowship, Rivero cemented her interests in digital media, photography, and film, while also delivering gallery talks and writing research, not unrelated to her undergraduate thesis on San Juan-based video artist, Beatriz Santiago Mu\u00f1oz.
