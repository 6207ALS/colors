    "description": "<p>In <em>Head of a Black Woman</em>, Sargent Claude Johnson combined abstract elements drawn from African sculpture and masks\u2014such as the regularly scored marks that describe hair\u2014with a naturalistic portrayal of the woman\u2019s physiognomy. In the 1920s and 1930s, writer and philosopher Alain Locke urged artists to seek aesthetic inspiration from African art, and Johnson frequently followed this advice. Here, by subtly stylizing the woman\u2019s appearance, Johnson made this delicate terracotta sculpture highly individual yet also timeless and universal.</p>\n",
