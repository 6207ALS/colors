    "description": "<p>Japanese architect Shigeru Ban has become recognized for the development of socially conscious projects through his innovative use of materials and unconventional approach to architecture and design. He is perhaps best known for developing modular papertube constructions used to swiftly and inexpensively erect temporary buildings that provide shelter and services to people who have been displaced by natural disasters. Ban has also applied his practice of modular design with recyclable materials to the design of consumer objects, as seen here in the 10-Unit System, manufactured by Artek. Similar to the paper tube constructions, Ban developed a system of parts\u2014identical in form\u2014that can be arranged in multiple configurations. In this piece a range of objects, including a chair, a table, and a bench, can be created through the simple L-shaped component made from a wood plastic composite. Through the use of hybrid construction methods and his intimate knowledge of materials, Ban created this furniture that is easy to assemble and disassemble, providing maximum flexibility for the user.</p>\n",
