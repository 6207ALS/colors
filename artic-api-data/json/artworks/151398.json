    "description": "<p>This kettle, made at the S\u00e8vres porcelain manufactory outside Paris, illustrates a story recounted by the ancient Roman historian Titus Livius, known in English as Livy. In 390 B.C., when Rome was under siege, a plebeian (commoner) named Albinius was fleeing the city, transporting his family in a cart. He encountered the vestal virgins, the guardian priestesses of the sacred flame of Rome, who were escaping on foot carrying their ritual vessels. Albinius offered his cart to the priestesses, thus performing a noble deed exhibiting both piety and\u00a0gravitas, or seriousness of purpose. The kettle is hard-paste porcelain, made from a mixture of kaolin (white clay made from broken down feldspathic rock) and petuntse (chinastone) that is glazed with powdered feldspar and fired at high temperatures (about 2372\u00b0 F, or 1300\u00b0 C). The porcelain is covered with a deep brown glaze, called\u00a0fond laque\u00a0(literally \u201clacquer glaze\u201d) for its resemblance to lacquer. The painters at S\u00e8vres developed this technique in about 1780. The figures, in matte gold and outlined in black enamel, are called\u00a0figures \u00e9trusques\u00a0(Etruscan figures) in S\u00e8vres\u2019 records, an allusion to the ancient vases that were so fashionable in the Neoclassical era.</p>\n",
