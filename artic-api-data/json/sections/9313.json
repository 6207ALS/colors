The 1859 discovery of the Comstock lode, the richest silver deposit in the country, expanded domestic production of silver objects; technological advancements in manufacturing increased output and allowed for a variety of new forms; and the rise of global trade and international exhibitions led to an unforeseen diversity of designs. Established firms such as Tiffany &amp; Co., Gorham Manufacturing Company, and the International Silver Company continued to enhance their presence alongside new firms eager to compete in the vastly expanded marketplace.\n\nGeorge W. Shiebler was one such entrepreneur to emerge during this boom era, producing some of the most innovative and artistic objects of his time. Born in Baltimore, Shiebler began his career in Washington, D.C., as an operator for the American Telegraph Company before entering the metals industry in New York in 1867. He started as a traveling salesman for the gold manufacturer Jahne, Smith, and Company, but soon established himself as a partner when he, A. J. G. Hodenpyl, and Pierre T. Tunison absorbed the firm in 1870. Shiebler withdrew from the partnership in 1874 and went into business for himself, acquiring a number of small silver manufacturers under his own name. Although he started out producing only flatware, he aggressively expanded his production to include hollowware, jewelry, and other silver novelties. By 1892, when Shiebler incorporated as George W. Shiebler and Company, he employed between 160 and 170 individuals across every stage of the production process, from forging plates and ingots to planishing and applying ornamentation. According to an account of his business published in the Jewelers\u2019 Circular and Horological Review in 1892, Shiebler \u201cwas convinced that in order to succeed he would have to depend upon originality of design; that his products would have to be out of [sic] the beaten track.\u201d\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s berry bowl is a remarkable example of the firm\u2019s deft and inventive handling of hollowware. It is the largest extant example of what Shiebler termed \u201cleave work,\u201d wherein the body of the vessel is shaped from a sheet of silver worked to resemble a highly naturalistic leaf. The edge of the metal\u2014like its verdant counterpoint\u2014is thin and irregular, rippling and folding over itself at certain places. Delicately chased veins are visible on the exterior and the lustrous gilded interior of the vessel, which are surrounded by visible hammer marks that suggest the crinkled surface of fallen foliage. Intricately entwined twigs and leaves create a highly distinctive handle that extends asymmetrically across the body of the bowl. Nestled into this thicket are a number of applied cast ornaments: copper cherries, silver plums, and a silver spider, fly, and beetle.\n\nInspired by Japanese naturalism, which was in vogue after Japan opened trade with the United States in 1853 and sponsored a pavilion at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition of 1876, the vessel also reflects the aesthetic ideals of Englishman John Ruskin, whose call for \u201ctruth to nature\u201d laid the foundation for the Arts and Crafts Movement. In keeping with these principles, each technique utilized to manipulate the metal heightens the object\u2019s naturalistic appearance.\n\nDuring its founder\u2019s lifetime, George W. Shiebler and Company\u2019s broad repertoire of wares and innovative craftsmanship enjoyed critical success, praised by one writer for \u201cevidence of originality and taste in the designing and expertness and carefulness in the executing.\u201d It is likely that Shiebler\u2019s work was also appreciated abroad, as the bowl bears not only the winged mark of the company, but also a number of French hallmarks that suggest the bowl was an export. However, in 1907 the firm declared bankruptcy. Gorham purchased the company, grinding down its vast inventory of dies and rolls and selling them, along with the firm\u2019s designs, machinery, and tools. Shiebler worked as an employee for Gorham from then until his death in 1920.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom (fig. 64.2)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Unidentified estate, Bellevue Avenue, Newport, RI, by 2012.\n\nWith Christie\u2019s (2012), lot 45.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2012.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Zapata and Soeffing (1995), p. 100, pl.
