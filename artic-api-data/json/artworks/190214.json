    "description": "<p>Several projects in Goldberg\u2019s later career focused on addressing special needs within the medical field in the United States and abroad. His Bonaventure Waystop Housing was designed to offer short-term convalescent care for patients with AIDS. It was developed in partnership with a professor from Northwestern University\u2019s School of Medicine and a priest from the sponsoring Alexian Brothers religious community. As an extension of a Chicago facility opened in 1989, Goldberg\u2019s design was intended to reduce patient hospital stays while providing a sense of community in a distinctly residential setting. At this early date in the history of the disease, his provision of family areas and childcare in the Bonaventure plan speaks to an approach of normalization and dignity, resisting the then-common public climate of stigmatization and fear.</p>\n",
