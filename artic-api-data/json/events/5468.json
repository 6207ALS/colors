Clarke, Rothman Family Curator of Prints and Drawings, as she discusses the exhibition<em> </em><a href=\"/exhibitions/9662/bridget-riley-drawings-from-the-artist-s-studio\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bridget Riley Drawings: From the Artist\u2019s Studio</em></a>.</p><p>The works in the exhibition cover the full range of Riley's career, from her student days in the late 1940s through her groundbreaking black-and-white optical works of the early 1960s and the innovative color studies she has continuously produced since the late 1960s. With this talk, Clarke considers how Riley has approached drawing as an essential part of her artistic practice, focusing specifically on how her early figure and landscape studies impacted her subsequent devotion to pure abstraction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
