    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The English architect and designer Edward William Godwin designed this sideboard in about 1876 when popular opinion favored highly colored and over decorated furnishings.  Godwin had just moved to London from his native Bristol and started designing furniture for his own apartment.  Godwin was fascinated by the architecture and arts and crafts of Japan.  After Japan reopened itself in the 1850s to international trade following more than 200 years of virtual isolation, its art was eagerly collected in the West, it cast a powerful influence on designers like Godwin.  In his furniture, Godwin reinterpreted the geometric elegance of buildings and furnishings he saw in Japanese prints.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Here he creates a sophisticated conversation between horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines and juxtaposes positive with negative space.  He also accentuates its graphic qualities by painting or ebonizing the mahogany surfaces eliminating any visually distracting grain in the wood.  Godwin was concerned with function as well as form, extensions to the right and left of the sideboard could be raised or lowered depending on the space available in a particular room.</p>\n",
