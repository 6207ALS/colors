    "description": "<p>This bowl belongs to a group of ceramics from 12th and 13th-century Iran known as Garrus ware. The name Garrus refers to a district in northwest Iran where these ceramics were excavated. Although these wares were found in Garrus, their exact origin of production is unknown. However, as with many modern-day appellations, these ceramics continue to be referred to as Garrus ware. The wares are united by a distinctive decorative technique: the decorative elements are incised on the surface of the object and set against slip backgrounds that are removed to showcase their central motifs against darker areas of color. On this bowl, a lioness has been incised on the interior with scrolling floral motifs showcased against an exposed dark red background.</p>\n",
