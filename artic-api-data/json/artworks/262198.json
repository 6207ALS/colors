    "description": "<p>Sculptor, lecturer, and author, Alfeo Faggi was born in Italy and began his formal studies in Florence. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 and settled in Chicago, where he attracted portrait commissions from a number of prominent Chicago women. He exhibited his painting and sculpture in Chicago and New York throughout the 1920s. Faggi moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1926, where he lived until his death in 1966. The collection includes correspondence between Faggi and Walter Brewster, exhibition catalogues, articles, and photographs of Faggi\u2019s work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Faggi,%20Alfeo,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
