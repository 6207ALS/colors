    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: \u201cErosion Number 2 Mother Earth Laid Bare\u201d by Alexandre Hogue 1936.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: It really completes the whole idea of the Dust Bowl.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  So if you look at this painting you see in the foreground a plough. Now, this is the same plough that Grant Wood represents in \u201cFall Ploughing\u201d but it is a plough that in Hogue\u2019s mind is responsible for killing the earth.</p>\n<p>NEWS CLIP:  Implements rust in the sun. Man\u2019s inventions like his plans discarded and cast aside, junk.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  The naked female form not only refers to the rape of the land but when we refer to the earth we usually call Mother Earth. So this is the decimation of our greatest mother.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  The concern here is that man\u2019s relationship to nature is to only not functioning, it's destructive. Regionalism was quite popular. By the middle of the 1930s, the tide begins to turn.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER:  Criticisms of regionalism was that it was too Pollyanna. It was not a true picture of what was happening. Many artists thought that it just had its head in the sand.</p>\n",
