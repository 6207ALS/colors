    "copy": " The Archives comprises four primary collections or categories of service, including: the Institutional Archives , the Imaging Archive, the Ryerson and Burnham Art and Architecture Archive , and the museum\u2019s digital preservation and records management program. To better understand the scope of our collections, you can explore the other webpages linked above, review our finding aids , or dig into our digital collections . We currently have publicly-accessible finding aids for the Ryerson and Burnham Art and Architecture Archive collections only. The Ryerson and Burnham Art and Architecture Digital Collections consist of over 55,000 searchable images and texts, offering a limited but representative selection of objects from our archive. However, this is a very small portion of our total holdings; the majority of our collections are not yet digitized. Below is a list of our current archival collections and the digitization status of each (i.e., fully, partially, or undigitized), including links to digital content when available. Please note that collections marked as \u201cfully digitized\u201d may not include digital surrogates of duplicate or low-value materials. Also, see our Digital Publications page for a selection of curated digital content from both library and archival collections. Please contact us via our Contact and Application for Access form with any questions or comments. ",
