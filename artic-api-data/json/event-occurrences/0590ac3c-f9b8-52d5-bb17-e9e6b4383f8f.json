They are dynamic presenters trained to connect people with art in ways that are fun, accessible, thought-provoking, and relevant to our everyday lives. Educators love discussing art and design their own tours so that each experience is unique and enriched by the interests of the facilitator and our visitors.&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-235a9e4c-7fff-f05c-d747-498d53973d02\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br></span></p>",
