Fruitlands, however, failed out of sheer impracticality predicated upon inordinate idealism.\n\nAfter a radical school for children that he initiated had failed, Bronson Alcott began Fruitlands in 1843 in a particularly beautiful landscape near Harvard, Massachusetts. Absolutely no animal products were consumed on the commune, hence the name Fruitlands. In fact, Ann Page, the only female member besides Alcott\u2019s wife, was expelled from the community for eating a piece of fish. A total of eleven adults eventually joined, including Samuel Bower, who became a nudist upon realizing that clothing was spiritually stifling, and a man who reportedly ate nothing but apples one year and crackers the next. Also part of the commune was Samuel Palmer, who wore a long, flowing beard that was out of style, and upon whose gravestone appears the epitaph, \u201cPersecuted for Wearing The Beard.\u201d\n\nAlcott seems to have been a remarkable man who made a lasting impression upon all those he met, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. An intellectual, educator and deeply religious figure, he was referred to as the \u201cfather of transcendentalism,\u201d an idealistic belief system in which the world and everything in it is thought to have a spiritual basis.\n\nNot only was the community vegetarian, no animal products were used whatsoever. Neither wool nor honey nor wax\u2014 not even animal fertilizer\u2014was used. Vegetables with roots that grew downward were forbidden because they disturbed worms. For a short time Fruitlands thrived, but during a visit Emerson commented with prescience: \u201cThey look well in July. We shall see them in December.\u201d And in fact, by January 1844, seven months after its founding, Fruitlands had fallen apart.\n\nA much more pragmatic transcendentalist utopia was begun in Roxbury, Massachusetts, in 1841, when George Ripley and fifteen others founded Brook Farm. Although the community was composed of poets and musicians, it was predicated upon a belief in physical labor as a condition of mental well-being. And unlike the members of Fruitlands, they did sell their milk and vegetables and honey.\n\nThe Brook Farmers worked hard, and when the workday was over there was an extraordinary calendar of musical events, dramatic readings, plays, literary society meetings and parties, dances and picnics. It all ended in 1846 when a fire destroyed the community\u2019s central building\u2014little physical trace remains today of Brook Farm. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
