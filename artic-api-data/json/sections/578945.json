Wall revetment fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished on the face. An inlay of rectangular shape. In an opaque white matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from densely packed segments of a single cane of white cased in a ring of amethyst. The pattern is quite irregular.\n\nThe piece is intact, preserving its original shape; the element has been backed with a piece of slate or steatite. The face has been repolished; all four sides have a dull weathering crust. Despite the polishing, there appears to be devitrification, heavy pitting, and possible breaks. The pattern is irregular, and the lines of heavy weathering on the face suggest that larger canes were used to create the pattern. The distortion seems to be a result of reheating and drawing out the canes perhaps multiple times. The original inlay may have been thicker, sawn in half, and backed, as was often done in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 96 Fragment of a Wall Revetment, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
