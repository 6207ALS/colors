The artist, an unknown follower of Rembrandt van Rijn, conveyed Jacob\u2019s ambivalent emotional state by presenting the boy with his back to the viewer. Rembrandt and his followers treated this subject many times, as the Protestant art market in the Dutch Republic valued scenes of faith and loyalty but lacked the Catholic interest in martyrdom.</p>\n",
