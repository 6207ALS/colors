Wood, 2004.675\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">In this drawing, the lithographic printer Thomas Way radiates casual confidence with his upright pose. Hands in pockets, he thrusts his left leg outward at an angle toward the viewer and gently turns his torso in the same direction. The features of his round face are barely indicated, but are just distinct enough to reveal a mouth widened in a subtle, close-lipped grin, similar to the expression captured in a photo taken around 1870 (fig. 38.1). His figure casts a shadow on the undefined space behind him, and the uneven lighting also creates passages of darkness on his jacket and his right leg in the area of the knee and ankle. Hatching along the left leg and arm conveys the folds of his clothing, giving depth to the otherwise flattened forms. The gentle shading and soft grain of the graphite imbue the image with an intimate quality that hints at the friendship between artist and subject.\n\nThomas Way was at the forefront of the lithographic revival in England in the late nineteenth century. As a boy the young Way had early exposure to the medium, which was then gaining popularity for use in topographical prints; the coffeehouse his father ran in London\u2019s Covent Garden district was situated in close proximity to a number of lithographic firms. He began an apprenticeship in the trade in 1851 and started his own firm about ten years later. He pioneered new printing techniques and advanced others, including lithotint, which Whistler subsequently took up. At the beginning of Way\u2019s career, lithography was used mainly as an inexpensive means to replicate images for commercial purposes, and was thus viewed by most British artists as an inferior printing technique unsuitable for creative expression. Way doggedly advocated for the artistic potential of the medium, and, with the help of high-profile figures such as Whistler, succeeded in raising its aesthetic status toward the end of the century.\n\nThe artist Edward William Godwin, a mutual friend, introduced Way to Whistler in 1877. The two men quickly developed a rapport. Way enthusiastically fostered Whistler\u2019s interest in lithography, and his firm, which he ran alongside his son, Thomas R. Way, printed the majority of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. Indeed, it is hard to imagine what Whistler\u2019s artistic contribution to the medium would have amounted to without Way\u2019s support and expertise, as the artist himself attested. When the editor of the Art Journal suggested in 1894 that Whistler use another printer to reproduce a lithograph in its pages, Whistler fiercely responded that he \u201cwould not possibly allow my work to be treated by any one else but Mr. Way. . . . [I]t is to him entirely that is due the revival of artistic lithography in England. . . . I certainly owe all the encouragement I may have received in my work to his exquisite interpretation.\u201d\n\nThe close relationship between artist and printer had flourished for nearly two decades by the time Whistler drew this study of Way. The two often worked in tandem at the printing firm\u2019s headquarters at 21 Wellington Street in London. It was here, on a dark winter day in 1896, that Whistler spontaneously drew four different versions of Way by firelight, resulting in the present pencil sketch and three related transfer lithographs. Thomas R. Way, the sitter\u2019s son, later recounted the incident in his biography of Whistler: \u201cOne afternoon he [Whistler] suddenly started drawing my father. In the office there were two rooms with a door between, and a big shadow thrown upon the wall behind. Three successive drawings did he make; the first, not carried very far, he scribbled over [Thomas Way; fig. 38.2]; the second he completed but was not satisfied with [Study No. 2: Mr. Thomas Way; fig. 38.3; [c 151]], and then he began the third. It was a winter\u2019s afternoon, and I was in the inner room with my father, and at work myself, and did not notice how the daylight was failing; but at last it dawned upon me, and I went to Whistler to light the gas for him. There I realised the position, for the bright light of the stove in the inner room had filled it. \u2018Why, Mr. Whistler, you have no light\u2013\u2013you cannot see\u2013\u2013you are drawing by feeling!\u2019 \u2018Almost, Tom, almost!\u2019 was his answer, and it was literally true. This drawing proved a most excellent portrait [Study No. 1: Mr. Thomas Way; fig. 38.4, [Way 107]].\u201d\n\nThe younger Way refers only to the three lithographs drawn on transfer paper in his anecdote. However, the direct correspondence between the Art Institute pencil drawing and the transferred prints, considered in regard to the impromptu circumstances described in Way\u2019s anecdote, makes it highly likely that all four were produced in the same session. Where the production of the drawing fits within the order of the lithographs is difficult to ascertain. It may have been done as a preparatory sketch to work out the general composition on ordinary paper before attempting it on transfer paper. The drawing reads as a complete thought, but lacks the more detailed shading and treatment of the second and third lithographs, which supports an interpretation of it as a preliminary effort.\n\nThe drawing is compositionally linked to all three lithographs in different ways. The shadowing behind the figure is closest to the first, incomplete version of the print (fig. 38.2). The slight smile on the model\u2019s face is reflected in both the first and second lithographs (fig. 38.3); his expression becomes more serious in the third iteration (fig. 38.4). The pointed left foot is most closely paralleled in the second print, but the lines and cut of the jacket are more closely evoked in the third. Thus, if the sheet is indeed a preparatory study, Whistler continued to refer back to elements of the original drawing as the work evolved.\n\nAmong the advantages of lithography frequently cited in the nineteenth century is that it registers the hand of the artist in an unusually immediate manner. The process of making a lithograph involves applying a greasy crayon or ink directly onto a lithographic stone or a piece of transfer paper; as such, the medium was championed as a way to effectively create multiple impressions of a drawing. The pencil study of Thomas Way reveals just how intimately the two creative processes were linked, for Whistler did not greatly alter his technique between the different mediums. His soft, sketchy outlines and diagonal shading are clearly registered in both formats, appearing fresh and spontaneous to the eye even as the multiple versions of the image provide irrefutable evidence of reworking.\n\nIn 1894 Whistler described Way as one of his \u201coldest and best friends,\u201d yet just two years later, shortly after he drew the printer in his office, their relationship deteriorated. Long-standing grievances surfaced and were exacerbated by Whistler\u2019s deep despair over his wife Beatrice\u2019s death in May of 1896. Mounting frustrations over long-unpaid bills for Way\u2019s services, disputes over ownership of some of Whistler\u2019s work, and disagreements over various business dealings eventually led to an irrevocable rift between the two men. In severing his ties with Way, Whistler lost one of his most important collaborators. His production of lithographs all but ceased, and he eventually gave up the medium altogether. The drawing of Way, together with the three lithographs, therefore bears added significance as a late record of both an intimate camaraderie and a fruitful creative partnership.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Study for Portrait of Thomas Way corresponds to Margaret F.

See Kemille Simonton Moore, \u201cThe Revival of Artistic Lithography in England, 1890\u20131913\u201d (PhD diss., University of Washington, 1990). Nicholas Smale also discusses the various contributions of Thomas Way, Thomas R. Way, and Whistler to the history of lithography in England in \u201cWhistler, Way, and Wellington Street,\u201d in The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, ed. Martha Tedeschi (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1998), 2:8\u201327. Useful contemporary accounts of the revival of artistic lithography in England that nod to the contributions of Thomas Way, Thomas R. Way, and Whistler can be found in two articles by M. H. Spielmann, \u201cThe Revival of Lithography. Introduction: Its Rise and First Decline\u201d and \u201cOriginal Lithography. The Present Revival in England,\u201d both in the Magazine of Art 20 (Nov. 1896\u2013Apr. 1897): 75\u201379, 289\u201396; and in Mabel Key, \u201cArtistic Lithography: Its Present Possibilities,\u201d Brush and Pencil 5, no. 1 (Oct. 1899): 31\u201344.\n\nSmale, \u201cWhistler, Way, and Wellington Street,\u201d 10\u201316.\n\nFor more on the circumstances of Way and Whistler\u2019s first meeting, see Smale, \u201cWhistler, Way, and Wellington Street,\u201d 17. Smale provides an invaluable and detailed account of the complex professional and personal relationships between Whistler, Thomas Way, and Thomas R. Way throughout all three men\u2019s careers.\n\nWhistler to David Croal Thomson, July 20, 1894, in The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed. Margaret F. MacDonald, Patricia de Montfort, and Nigel Thorp, online edition (Glasgow, UK: University of Glasgow, 2003\u201310), hereafter GUW, no. 08270; cited in Britt Salvesen, \u201cPortraits and Published Editions,\u201d \u201cSongs on Stone: James McNeill Whistler and the Art of Lithography,\u201d special issue, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 24, no. 1 (1998): 106.\n\nThis close professional and personal relationship is well documented in their lengthy correspondence, which is reprinted in the 1998 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. See \u201cWhistler-Way Correspondence,\u201d in Tedeschi, The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, 2:28\u2013195. It has also been documented in the University of Glasgow\u2019s online edition of Whistler\u2019s correspondence. See https://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/.\n\nThe dating of the four related works is not entirely certain; however, Spink, Stratis, Tedeschi, and Salvesen make a good case for dating the works to the early months of 1896 in their entries on the three prints in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Whistler\u2019s lithographs. See Stratis and Tedeschi, The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, 1:433\u201339 (cats. 150, 151, and 152). Margaret MacDonald also dates the drawing to 1896, no doubt using similar logic, in her entry in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Whistler\u2019s drawings. See MacDonald (1995), 520\u201321 (cat. 1453).\n\nWay\u2019s mention of \u201cdrawings\u201d here should be understood as a reference to lithographs. In the parlance of the day, lithographs were often referred to as drawings. This stemmed from the fact that an artist draws directly onto a stone or piece of transfer paper in the process of making a lithographic print. In the nineteenth century lithography was frequently touted as a means by which artists could create, in essence, replicable drawings.\n\nT. R. Way, Memories of James McNeill Whistler, the Artist (London: John Lane, 1912), 124. The Pennells corroborate many of the details from Way\u2019s version of these events. See E. R. and J. Pennell, The Life of James McNeill Whistler (London: William Heinemann; Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott, 1908), 2:169. The titles of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, which cause understandable confusion, follow from the artist\u2019s established practice of numbering his prints in the order of his preference, rather than the order in which they were made. See Stratis and Tedeschi, The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, 1:435\u201339 (cats. 152 and 153).\n\nIn transfer lithography, the artist draws on a piece of specially prepared coated paper, which can then be used to transfer the image directly onto a lithographic stone for printing, destroying the original piece of transfer paper in the process. For more information on this technique and Whistler\u2019s engagement with it, see Nicholas Smale, \u201cWhistler and Transfer Lithography,\u201d Tamarind Papers: Technical, Critical and Historical Studies on the Art of the Lithograph 7, no. 2 (Fall 1984): 72\u201383.\n\nWhistler to Thomas R. Way, July 20, 1894, GUW, no. 03377.\n\nFor more on the circumstances contributing to the breakdown of Whistler and Way\u2019s relationship, see Smale, \u201cWhistler, Way, and Wellington Street,\u201d 22\u201326.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 38 Study for Portrait of Thomas Way, 1896.\n\nfig. 38.1 Thomas Way, c. 1870.
