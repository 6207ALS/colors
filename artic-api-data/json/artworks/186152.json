In it he criticized the immorality of the business world and the anarchy of free competition, arguing that, \u201ctruth and commerce are as incompatible as Jesus and Satan.\u201d\n\nFourier advocated a new system of cooperation based on what he called \u201cphalanxes,\u201d meticulously planned model communities with exactly 1,620 people of all classes (twice the number of distinctive human personality types he had identified), whose lives would be structured for maximum collaboration and fulfillment.\n\nUnderlying Fourier\u2019s theory was the notion of \u201cpassional attraction,\u201d which he defined as \u201cthe drive given to us by nature.\u201d In his view, complete sexual gratification would lead to perfect harmony. During Fourier\u2019s lifetime a few communities were initiated in France\u2014including one begun by the industrialist Godin, who set up his cast-iron kitchen goods factory in Gurse as a modified Fourierist Phalanx.\n\nThere is much in Fourier\u2019s writing that is laughable nonsense: he believed that the ideal world he was helping to create would last eighty-thousand years during which six moons would circle the Earth, there would be thirty-seven million poets equal to Homer, thirty-seven million mathematicians equal to Newton and the seas would become oceans of lemonade. But there was also much that was perceptive in his writings and he was able to attract a widespread following.\n\nAfter Fourier\u2019s death in 1837, many of his followers came to the US and founded a succession of short-lived communities. Over two dozen phalanxes were established\u2014thus making Fourierism the most popular secular community movement of the entire nineteenth century. None of the American phalanxes were full-scale, either in numbers or in constructing a large \u201cphalanstery\u201d according to Fourier\u2019s grandiose and imaginative plans. One of the most renowned of all American communal experiments, Brook Farm, in Roxbury, Massachusetts, became a Fourierist phalanx and flourished as such, until a disastrous fire brought about its end in 1846.\n\nAmong these phalanxes was the Mixville Association in Wiscoy, New York, founded in 1844. When this photograph was made, in 1996, it was functioning as a bed and breakfast.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
