    "description": "<p>One of Chicago's premier art patrons and an architecture and interior design critic, Judith Neisser has amassed a remarkable collection of international contemporary art. More than 100 works are presented in this captivating, inside look at the Neisser family collection, highlighting paintings, sculpture, and works on paper from the 1960s to the present. Special emphasis is given to Minimalism and Conceptualism, most notably objects by Sol LeWitt, Robert Ryman, Donald Judd, Brice Marden, and Blinky Palermo. Other artists practicing in distinct traditions, such as Eva Hesse, Cy Twombly, and Rudolf Stingel, have been wonderfully integrated into the collection based on shared themes such as seriality, the monochrome, reductive geometric forms, and the grid. Included in this generously illustrated book is an in-depth interview with Neisser about her distinctive collection.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<p>by James Rondeau<br>Contributions by Anne Rorimer</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9.50 x 9.50 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 160</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 116 color illus.</li>\n</ul>",
