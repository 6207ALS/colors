A wormlike form emerges from this creature\u2019s mouth, as in nineteenth-century photographic representations of ectoplasm, and it is grasped by the infant in folio 6B/C. This larval form recalls a passage in Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony that describes a monstrous figure whose skull is crowned with roses and whose torso is female. The creature is shrouded by a veil, which in turn forms a tail that undulates like a gigantic worm. Another worm moves from folios 7A/B and 7C/D into folio 6B/C.\n\nThese undulating worms may relate to the tapeworm from which Ensor himself suffered from late 1884 to August 1885 (see \u201cThe Trials of \u2018The Temptation\u2019\u201d), but they also reference contemporary debates over evolution, particularly Charles Darwin\u2019s best-selling publication The Formation of Vegetable Mould through the Action of Worms, with Observations on Their Habits (John Murray, 1881), a study of the earthworm and its effect on the soil. Darwin\u2019s long-standing interest in the role of worm digestion in soil irrigation and its relation to his theories of evolution was parodied by the London satirical journal Punch (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). Darwin\u2019s writings and theories also inspired Flaubert\u2019s and Odilon Redon\u2019s use of worm imagery. See, for example, plate 8 of Redon\u2019s first series illustrating Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony (fig. 3) and the hybrid worm/fish figures in Redon\u2019s image of the Chimera, a fire-breathing female monster from Greek mythology (fig. 4). Most probably, Ensor saw some of Redon\u2019s biologically inspired images at the salon of Les XX (Les Vingt, 1883\u201393) in 1886.\n\nThe bug-eyed alien whose head splits open to reveal numerous smaller heads might allude to the blue Buddha of Flaubert\u2019s text, although the drawing bears little resemblance to Flaubert\u2019s description. Or it may reference an attack Ensor\u2019s father suffered in early 1885, during which neighborhood thugs removed his beard and moustache, gave him a tonsure, and cut his head and neck with razors (see \u201cThe Trials of \u2018The Temptation\u2019\u201d).\n\nThe solemn figure of Saint Anthony is placed centrally. Ensor enlarged Anthony\u2019s shoulders over the existing drawing; the absence of blue colored pencil along the right edge of the sheet indicates that the cloak was developed with the sheet edges already overlapped. The artist may also have extended Anthony\u2019s beard and altered his eyes, closing them or even changing their placement. The serpentine larval form at upper left covers existing drawing and extends upward, linking the compositions. SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 Edward Linley Sambourne (English, 1844\u20131910).
