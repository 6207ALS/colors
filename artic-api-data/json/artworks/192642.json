    "description": "<p>With their Carbon Chair, Bertjan Pot and Marcel Wanders paid homage to midcentury designers Charles and Ray Eames\u2019s famous Eiffel Chair while also remaining faithful to the Eameses\u2019 interest in experimenting with new materials. Pot and Wanders replaced the fiberglass plastic seat and metal wire base of the earlier piece with epoxy-drained carbon fibers, an advanced material that is both strong and lightweight.<br>The Carbon Chair consists of two parts: a slender, hand-coiled base and a shell seat, which was patterned on a mold. This structure, created in the hand-coiling process, was intended to optimize the chair\u2019s strength and stability.</p>\n",
