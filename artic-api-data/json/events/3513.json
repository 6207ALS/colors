    "description": "<p>Family-based band Choro das 3 is composed of of three sisters: Corina (flutes), Lia (7-string acoustic guitar), Elisa (mandolin, clarinet, banjo, and piano) and their father Eduardo (pandeiro). The band plays Brazilian instrumental music, and their main style is<em> choro</em> (\"cry\" or \"lament\"), a genre that emerged in Brazil in the 19th century. </p><p>Historically, <em>choro</em> is considered the first characteristically Brazilian genre of urban popular music, and was an important influence on painter Tarsila do Amaral. Tarsila, as she is known in Brazil, has been described as \"the Brazilian painter who best achieved Brazilian aspirations for nationalistic expression in a modern style.\"</p><p><em>This program is presented with the Old Town School of Folk Music as part of its World Music Wednesday series. <br></em></p><p><em>Support for Live Arts programming is generously provided by the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago. </em></p>",
