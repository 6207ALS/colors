    "description": "<p>Siah Armajani\u2019s affinity for interior and public architecture is articulated in this sculpture, one of his early works from his <em>Dictionary for Building</em> sculpture series, in which he combines text from Robert Frost\u2019s poem, <em>The Hill Wife</em> (1916) with abstracted, yet recognizable furniture or architectural objects, in this case a fireplace mantel. The poem\u2019s text about a couple\u2019s uneasy relationship with their home expands upon Armajani\u2019s interpretation of a mantel as a dynamic structure\u2014as opposed to a fixed centerpiece or sentimental hearth\u2014to be moved through and around. Mirrors, which conventionally are installed above a fireplace, are angled inwards to reveal otherwise imperceptible aspects of the structure. For the artist, sculpture was \u201cnot a thing between four walls in a geometric spatial sense but a tool which directs us into a place for living, sitting, resting, reading, eating, and talking,\u201d suggesting a symbiotic relationship between furniture, sculpture and architecture.</p>\n",
