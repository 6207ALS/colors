The intaglio shows a horse, depicted in profile, with its head lowered, as if to graze. As is common for such depictions of horses on Roman gems, one front leg (here the left) is raised below the horse\u2019s body. In this particular example the hoof is lifted so high that it appears as though the horse is scratching the underside of his stomach\u2014a playful image, presenting a gesture that is actually a physical impossibility for the real animal. The main body of the horse is shown in broad naturalistic curves, but the legs, face, mane, and tail are much more stylized\u2014with the hooves and joints of the leg rounded, the tail bushy and full, and the mane rising in rhythmic spikes, which at the front of the head indeed appear to replace the ears. This is a characterful representation.\n\nThe horse was a relatively popular motif for intaglio seals in the Roman Empire, with a good number of surviving examples showing a single horse with its head lowered, as if to graze, as in this case. In other examples the horse is rolling on the ground, galloping, or rearing. Horses were a sign of wealth and prestige in the Roman context, and a symbol of sportsmanship besides for the young men who Strabo tells us would race their chariots on the Campus Martius, just outside of Rome\u2019s city walls. Indeed, horses had also been a motif in Greek glyptic art from the most ancient times, presumably for similar reasons. The horse was thus an enduring symbol of victory, status, and wealth in the ancient world. More broadly too, profile images of a range of other animals and livestock were also popular in the Roman context, with bulls and boars commonly appearing, as well as lions, and occasionally even such exotic beasts as the rhinoceros or crocodile. Each of these animals no doubt readily invited associations of power, or manly prowess, recommending them as a popular choice in Roman glyptic arts.  \nNicola Barham\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See also cat. 137, Fragment of a Cameo Portraying Emperor Tiberius, Method. The high-resolution photography reveals grooves that suggest that the gem was cut with a lap wheel and a slurry abrasive (most probably corundum and a lubricant like olive oil). Thanks to Martin Henig for this observation.For the method of carving gems in antiquity, see the J. Paul Getty Museum\u2019s short documentary, The Art of Gem Carving: http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/video/142937/the-art-of-gem-carving/.\n\nThis image of a horse with a raised front hoof was quite common, though other versions kept the hoof lower.
