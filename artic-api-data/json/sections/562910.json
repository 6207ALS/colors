Bowl or dish fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves the bottom of a small bowl, with a segment of vessel wall preserved beyond the thickened pad base. The mosaic pattern is formed from sections of two canes, one polygonal and one square, the first of amethyst ground with random white dots, the second of opaque yellow segments.\n\nThe fragment is broken on all sides; the solid pad base is complete. The interior is repolished but pitted. The surface is dull with patches of brilliant silvery iridescence; square yellow sections are covered with light-brown weathering crust.\n\nAlthough no exact parallels for this fragment could be located, there are many vessels decorated with square monochrome segments from the Hellenistic empires to the Roman world. The density of the contrasting segments in a deep-amethyst matrix with scattered white dots is unusual.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 90 Fragment of a Vessel, 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
