    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Spanish surrealist artist Salvador Dali finished this painting in 1937, titling it \u201cVisions of Eternity.\u201d Former Director. Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: we see what looks like a remnant of a classical arch and on top of it a figure whose hands are brought together in what might be a gesture of prayer, but could also be a gesture of despair. Something has blown a whole through the figure. It\u2019s a very barren landscape and, yet, those bean-like forms on the ground suggest the possibility of seed-like rebirth. The whole tradition of painting in Western European art treats the picture like a window onto the natural world. What Dali and the other surrealists wished to do was to take that tradition, but introduce a new dimension of reality, the reality of the inner world, the world of dreams and the imaginations and desires and psychoses. This ambition was formed by what the artists of this generation had witnessed and that is the cataclysm of the First World War when the veneer of rationalism had broken down and the violence that\u2019s never far from the surface of civilized society had broken forth.</p>\n",
