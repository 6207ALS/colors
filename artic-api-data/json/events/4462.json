Today, it is a collection of more than 1,900 works of art, consisting of modern and contemporary American art from the 19th and 20th centuries through today.</p><p>Anderson Japanese Gardens started in 1978 in the backyard of Rockford businessman John Anderson after he visited the Portland Japanese Garden in Oregon.
