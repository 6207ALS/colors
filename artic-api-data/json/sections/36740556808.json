Braude Memorial Collection, 2013.986\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Stacks of Wheat is one of two drawings he made of the subject. It was created with black chalk on laid paper, laid down on cardboard. Fine chalk lines define the general forms of the haystacks in the foreground and then broader passages produce the modeled effects of light and shadow within the form. There is a narrow absence of media between the fine outer lines and the interior shading that creates the effect of illumination from behind (fig. 33.1). Stumping was used selectively to suggest trees, bushes, and a house in the background. The drawing process is direct, and the composition has no visible areas of erasure or reworking.\n\nThe chalk deposited preferentially along high points in the support, possibly from the mount or another surface upon which he worked, creating a type of frottage (fig. 33.2). Light transfer of the medium across the sheet has also transferred selectively onto these peaks across the paper surface, rendering the laid paper mold pattern visible.\n\nClaude Monet (recto, lower left, in black chalk) (fig. 33.3).\n\nCream (discolored to tan), medium-thick, moderately textured laid paper.\n\nHorizontal, 2.3 cm.\n\n6\u20137 cm.\n\nUniform, short cream and tan fibers with occasional brown-fiber inclusions.\n\nEven, machine made.\n\nAll edges are trimmed straight to the dimensions of the cardboard mount. It is unclear whether the paper was mounted to the board later and then trimmed down or manufactured as a drawing or illustration board.\n\n18.2 \u00d7 25.4 cm (7 1/8 \u00d7 10 in.).\n\nCardboard. The cardboard is composed of moderately long paper fibers, with visible paper-bark inclusions. Under magnification, tiny spots of blue pigment are visible in some areas, and there is a pale-blue spot in the upper right area. Gummed, tan paper tape was applied around the perimeter.\n\n18.2\u00d7 25.4 \u00d7 0.15 cm (7 1/8 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 1/16 in.).\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible under normal conditions or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface size.\n\nThe drawing was created with black chalk. The chalk lines are dense, cohesive, and uniform, characteristics of a somewhat hard, fabricated manufacture. The stacks in the foreground were initially defined with fine crayon lines, broader passages were then applied to create the effects of light and shadow within the form. There is a narrow absence of media between the fine outer lines and the interior shading that gives the effect of illumination from behind. A stump was used selectively to suggest trees, bushes, and a house in the background. Small clumps of chalk have accumulated along peaks in the paper that resulted from the laid mold and from fiber clumps in the primary support. The chalk also accumulated along high points in the secondary support, creating a type of frottage.\n\nThere does not appear to be drawing on the verso; the mount prevents study of the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is mounted overall to cardboard; some areas of adhesion have detached, creating bubbles between the paper support and the cardboard mount. There is a large area of loss in the paper at the right top edge that is 2.5 \u00d7 0.3 cm in dimension, exposing the mount below. A fine, one-centimeter-long fold in the paper is visible along the right side of the top edge. The paper has discolored overall, caused by overexposure to light and inherent qualities of the paper. The original, lighter tonality is evident along the perimeter, which was covered by an overmat. The overmat contained a poor-quality, acidic core material that caused mat burn along the mat opening and paper interface. Remnants of the overmat are evident in some areas along the perimeter. There are also small brown stains (foxing spots) at the center top and along the bottom, and right sides. The drawing exhibits visible smudging and transfer. There are fine creases on the center right and center bottom area.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Private collector, Pennsylvania, to May 1991.\n\nSold, Sotheby\u2019s, New York, May 8, 1991, lot 101, to Dorothy Braude Edinburg.\n\nGiven by Dorothy Braude Edinburg to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K.
