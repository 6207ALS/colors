Ryerson Collection, 1933.1161\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s V\u00e9theuil was executed on a pre-primed, non-standard-size linen canvas. The off-white ground consists of two layers. The painting was built up using a relatively open network of brushstrokes that leaves the ground layer and canvas texture visible throughout. There are no apparent changes to the composition, which was built up directly from the initial lay-in. Areas where the canvas weave remains prominent, combined with the low-relief texture of underlying brushwork and surface strokes of low impasto, contribute varied texture to the paint surface. The work was carried out in more than one session and incorporates both wet-over-dry and wet-in-wet paint application. The generally warm palette and narrow tonal range used by the artist impart an overall warm, rose-colored tonality to the work. There are areas of localized abrasion and slightly flattened or pressed paint, which occurred while the painting was in progress, but it is difficult to say whether they are related to the artist\u2019s working process or whether they were accidental occurrences. A few minor damages\u2014tiny gouges and paint losses that occurred when the paint was still soft\u2014were restored using a zinc white\u2013containing paint. The retouching is difficult to distinguish from the original paint in some places and appears to have been applied early on.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 43.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1901 (lower left corner, in pale-pink paint) (fig. 43.2). The signature was started using a deeper-purple paint; the artist then went over the l a second time with a pale pink paint, which was used for the remainder of the signature and date (fig. 43.3). This paint becomes very faint in the final digits of the date; the 901 was then reinforced with a slightly thicker pale-pink paint (fig. 43.4). The underlying paint layers were dry when the signature and date were applied, except for some of the blue and purple strokes added along the bottom edge, which were picked up by the signature (fig. 43.5). These strokes may represent final touches added by the artist just before signing the painting.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 89 \u00d7 92 cm. This slightly wider than square format does not correspond to a standard size; both dimensions, however, correspond to standard stretcher-bar lengths.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 17.8V (0.8) \u00d7 20.0H (0.6) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were detected with other Monet paintings analyzed.\n\nThere is mild cusping on all four sides of the canvas; this is slightly more pronounced along the bottom.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1974 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 6\u20138 cm apart. Additional holes interspersed between these were likely added later for reinforcement. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tacks.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.8 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. It was documented as Buck type 2, six-membered, including horizontal and vertical crossbars, with keyable mortise and tenon joints and a beveled back face. The report gives the following dimensions: overall height, 92.5 cm; overall width, 89.0 cm; stretcher members: outside depth, 2.0 cm; width, 6.6 cm; inside depth, 1.8 cm; distance from canvas position, 1.0 cm; length of mortise, 6.6 cm.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of two layers. The lower layer ranges from approximately 2 to 60 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer measures approximately 5 to 85 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 43.6, fig. 43.7).\n\nOnly the upper ground layer is visible when the painting surface is examined microscopically. It is off-white with some dark and possibly red or brown particles visible under magnification, as well as some larger white clusters (fig. 43.8).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of silica and silicates. The upper layer contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of iron oxide, alumina, silica, and silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe artist worked up the composition as a whole, moving back and forth between the different areas of the composition with no apparent revisions or changes as the painting progressed. The work was built up using a network of open brushstrokes that leaves small areas of the ground layer exposed throughout (fig. 43.9). The initial lay-in of the composition was executed with lightly applied brushstrokes using a relatively dry brush, such that the paint was deposited mainly on the peaks of the canvas weave. These areas, where the canvas texture is particularly noticeable, remain evident through the open brushwork (fig. 43.10). The vertical canvas threads appear quite prominent on the surface of the painting. In some places, this is due to random thick threads, but in other areas, the vertical threads are often emphasized by horizontal brushstrokes that caused paint to build up in the ridges along the edges of the threads (fig. 43.11). In a few areas, localized abrasion of the first thin paint layers was observed. It is unclear whether this was part of the artist\u2019s process (i.e., intentional scraping or wiping of the paint surface) or whether it was an accident of handling, but it seems to have occurred during the painting process as subsequent paint strokes pass over the abraded areas (fig. 43.12). In the upper paint layers, some areas of thicker paint application have a slightly flattened or pressed appearance, which appears to have occurred while the paint was still slightly soft (fig. 43.13).\n\nThe surface texture of the painting includes crisp brushmarks from underlying layers, as well as thick, textural strokes and low impasto applied to the surface (fig. 43.14). While much of the surface paint layers consist of wet-in-wet applications, many of the textural strokes from the underlying layers were already surface dry when the painting was built up, indicating that the work was carried out in more than one session (fig. 43.15). The hill consists of a buildup of long directional strokes of different colors, lightly dragged across the surface of the canvas (fig. 43.16). The buildings were often delineated with a few thick, textural strokes that leave the very thin, light-handed application of the underpainting visible (fig. 43.17). In the reflected townscape, the artist laid in several long vertical strokes of textural and low-impasto paint in lighter tones of yellow and orange to denote the reflections of the buildings. These strokes appear to have been set up when the short, horizontal touches of red and purple of the water were applied on top (fig. 43.18). Overall, the palette consists of warm tones: pinks, purples, reds, oranges, and yellows for the buildings that reflect the setting sun, as well as for the reflections of the buildings and landscape in the water. The sky and water are composed of warm tones of yellowish-green and blue with some purple hues, both warm and cool. The overall tonal range is quite narrow, with little contrast between darks and lights, which helps to convey the diffuse light of the scene. The loose brushwork and subtle color transitions used in the work cause forms to blur into one another, without distinct borders, for example, between the horizon and the sky (fig. 43.19), the shoreline and the river (fig. 43.20), and the reflection and the water (fig. 43.21). The transition from one building to another is often made simply by a change in the direction of the brushstrokes or a slight shift in hue; the edges of the rooftops often remain quite sketchy (fig. 43.22). The houses and foliage on the far right of the canvas consist of an almost indistinguishable swirl of brushstrokes (fig. 43.23).\n\nThere are several small damages in the paint layer that appear to be old. They are scattered throughout the sky, the right side of the hill, the buildings on the left, and the reflection (near center). These damages, when there is associated paint loss, are visible as dark spots in the X-ray and, under UV light, retouching applied to the losses exhibits the bright greenish-yellow fluorescence of the zinc white used in the paint mixture (Palette) (fig. 43.24). Under magnification, the original paint in these areas appears to have been gouged when it was still soft and therefore must have occurred relatively early in the painting\u2019s lifetime. Localized retouching consists, for the most part, of a generic pale-green paint that does not always match the adjacent original paint (fig. 43.25, fig. 43.26). The retouching appears to be old and is intimately connected with the original paint. In one place, near the peak of the roof of the building second from left, the retouching is well matched and difficult to distinguish from the original paint (fig. 43.27). This may indicate that the retouching was carried out very early on, and the possibility that Monet retouched the painting himself cannot be ruled out.\n\nBrushes, including 1.0, 1.5 and 2 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet. The presence of a pinkish-orange fluorescence indicates that the artist used red lake throughout the landscape and in the signature. Areas of retouching, which exhibit a bright-greenish-yellow fluorescence under UV light, were found to contain zinc white, and sometimes traces of barium sulfate and an iron oxide\u2013containing pigment.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an even, synthetic varnish (see Conservation History). The surface is relatively matte, with subtle variations depending on the qualities of the underlying paint. The 1974 treatment report states that the painting previously had a discolored and yellowed, soft resin varnish. Its origin is unknown.\n\nThe pre-1974-treatment-notes state that \u201ccleavage and flaking were present in the past and were treated locally with wax adhesive. In order to hide this treatment a piece of canvas had been placed behind the original canvas to hide the wax stains in the original canvas.\u201d\n\nIn 1974, a yellowed varnish layer was removed. The canvas added to the back of the original canvas in a previous treatment was removed, and the original canvas was wax-resin lined. The painting was restretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nThe painting is wax-resin lined and is stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. The ground layer exhibits a fine cracking pattern that follows the weave of the canvas. There is significant ground loss on the tacking edges. The paint layer is in good condition overall. There are a few small damages that appear to have occurred when the paint was still soft. Localized retouching associated with these damages is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the original paint and was probably added early on. It was found to contain zinc white paint. In some places, the retouching is mismatched. More recent retouching was applied almost continuously around the edges. There is some slight flattening of the impasto in localized areas, probably the result of the lining process. Cracking is minimal, and where present, it is mainly visible only under magnification. The painting has an even, synthetic varnish coating. Starch-paste adhesive residues from the lining procedure are visible microscopically on the surface of the painting. There are also some yellowed, natural-resin varnish residues in the recesses of the paint texture.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1991): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame with carved alternating acanthus-leaf and flower running motif and acanthus-leaf miters, plain hollow, carved ribbon ornament and cove at the sight. The frame is water gilded over yellow-brown bole on gesso. The hollow is burnished with selective burnishing on the carved ornament. The gold has been heavily rubbed overall and toned with thin oil paint washes, casein washes, and dark flecking. The carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ogee carved with flower and tongue; scotia side; convex face carved with alternating acanthus-leaf and flower running motif and acanthus-leaf miters; fillet; plain hollow; fillet; torus with carved ribbon; and cove at the sight (fig. 43.28).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed 1991): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, L-shaped, narrow frame with a gilded face on a mahogany molding with exposed splines at the miters. The frame may be a design by James L. Speyer (fig. 43.29).\n\nPrevious frame: Sometime between 1956 and 1962 (based on an approximate date photograph (fig. 43.30), the work was mounted together with the Art Institute\u2019s other version of V\u00e9theuil in a painted shadow box. The paintings\u2019 stretchers were mounted to the back panel of the frame with the edges of the canvas exposed. This frame was probably only utilized during this installation.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 8, 1905, for 12,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Paul Mulle de Jaegher, Roubaix, France, Nov. 8, 1911, for 20,000 francs.\n\nAcquired by Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, by Apr. 18, 1912.\n\nSold by Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 18, 1912, for 16,000 francs.\n\nSent by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York (for Martin A.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture includes lead white, cobalt violet, vermilion, and red lake. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_1161\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 22, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings in the Art Institute collection, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a somewhat sketchy state with areas of exposed ground. Monet often added a few strokes to the edges just before signing the work. As his stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 noted, Monet \u201csigned his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u201d Quoted in John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, V\u00e9theuil, 1901(W1645/1933.1161),\u201d Dec. 2011.\n\nThe canvas does, however, show a thread-count match with V\u00e9theuil (1901; 1933.447 [W1643]) (cat. 42) and Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather (1900; 1984.1173 [W1557]) (cat. 38); a warp-thread match was determined between these latter two paintings, but no warp or weft overlap was detected with this painting. The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMicrofossils were identified by PLM and SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. Traces of iron detected in the chalk layer may be associated with the chalk or the silicates. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 11, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 15, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_1161\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 22, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMicrofossils were identified by PLM and SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 11, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d date; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_1161\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 22, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThese observations are particularly apparent when one compares this painting with V\u00e9theuil (1901; 1933.447 [W1643]) (cat. 42), which depicts the brighter, crisper light of an earlier time of day, and where individual forms are more distinct. The two paintings are very similarly composed, but the perspectives are slightly different. In this painting, the viewpoint is slightly elevated, looking down on the village, whereas in the other V\u00e9theuil picture, the village is slightly higher on the canvas. In addition, the foreground buildings on the right side are also painted at different angles.\n\nThis could have been a general toning layer. It is possible that subsequent layers of retouching were removed in previous cleanings.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). XRF analysis detected cobalt and arsenic in areas of purple paint, indicating that the cobalt violet is a cobalt arsenate. PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 11, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1161\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 15, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_1161\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 22, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
