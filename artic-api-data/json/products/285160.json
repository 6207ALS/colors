    "description": "<p>Jean-Michel Basquiat painted Defacement (The Death of Michael Stewart) on the wall of Keith Haring\u2019s studio in 1983 to commemorate the death of a young black artist who died from injuries sustained while in police custody after being arrested for allegedly tagging a New York City subway station. Defacement is the starting point for the present volume, which focuses on Basquiat\u2019s response to anti-black racism and police brutality. Basquiat\u2019s \u201cDefacement\u201d: The Untold Story explores this chapter in the artist\u2019s career through both the lens of his identity and the Lower East Side as a nexus of activism in the early 1980s, an era marked by the rise of the art market, the AIDS crisis and ongoing racial tensions in the city.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Softcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>6.5 x 9.5 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 168</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 60 color</li></ul>",
