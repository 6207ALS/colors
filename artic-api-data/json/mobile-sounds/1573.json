    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: This is a really shocking painting to come upon after seeing the French Impressionists. Suddenly, you\u2019re confronted with a life-size figure of a woman totally naked with her arms outstretched and this hypnotic stare that just holds you.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: It\u2019s about a nude being used as a symbol by an artist who was known as the symbolist art [ph?] salon\u2019s Ferdinand Hodler, a Swiss artist who really became known in Paris for these types of paintings that were about ideas and emotions.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Hodler called the painting \u201cDay\u201d or \u201cTruth.\u201d</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: Either one could be symbolized by this painting. She could be perhaps pushing away the clouds of darkness and coming into the light or she could be pushing away the clouds of deceit and showing that she has nothing to hide, that this is truth, that this is truth laid bare, as it were.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Notice how the strange dream-like landscape is made up of thinly painted veils of color while the woman\u2019s body is more thickly painted, giving it a greater sense of volume and solidity.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: It\u2019s very beautifully painted in an almost classical manner, almost an old master of layering on layering of pigments. And yet her hair is very graphic. It\u2019s almost like poster art. It\u2019s black and green, it\u2019s striated, and it has those under-lighting forms that you find in Art Nouveau, design at the time, and this is right in the middle of the Art Nouveau movement.</p>\n",
