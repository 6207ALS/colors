    "description": "<p>Over the course of his 70-year career, Thomas Sully painted more than two thousand portraits, including <em>Dr. Joseph Klapp</em> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72375/mrs-klapp-anna-milnor\"><em>Mrs. Klapp (Anna Milnor)</em></a> (1950.1362). Joseph Klapp was born and raised in Albany, New York, but studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and settled in Philadelphia. In the portrait, Klapp rests his elbow on a medical text, indicating his profession. The books lining the background of the painting also speak to the sitter\u2019s intellectual prowess. The image of Mrs. Klapp, painted in a harmoniously limited color scheme, emphasizes her beauty. Together, the portraits present an image of a sophisticated couple that celebrates their prosperity, intelligence, and taste.</p>\n",
