Studd was a painter, collector, and close friend of Whistler; he lived at 97 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, next to the house where the American artist resided for eleven years. Studd was painting in Lyme Regis, Dorset, in the autumn of 1895, when Whistler was also staying in the seaside village. In this pair of informal portraits, the identification of the male sitter as Arthur Studd is unmistakable based on its similarity to a more complete frontal portrait drawn by Whistler in black chalk (fig. 136a [M 1499]). The female sitter in the lithograph was identified by T. R. Way (1905) simply as \u201cMiss Phillip\u201d (sic), presumably meaning Rosalind Birnie Philip.\n\nIn his 1905 catalogue Way described this image as an \u201cexperiment upon a new transfer paper,\u201d no doubt referring to the white transfer paper he sent to Whistler on October 1. The artist made two experiments on Way\u2019s paper (cat. 133 and cat. 134) before declaring his dislike of its grained-stone texture. Based on the absence of this readily identifiable surface quality and the presence of the word Right in the lower-left corner of the image, there is no doubt that the artist sketched the present image not on the \u201cnew transfer paper\u201d but on a sheet of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that he brought with him from Paris. Because the Ways had difficulty in deciphering which side of the transparent French paper was the \u201cchalked side\u201d (i.e. the side bearing the drawing), Whistler promised them in late September that he would \u201cin future . . . write in pencil or ink \u2018Good\u2019 on the chalked side\u2014in a corner.\u201d In this instance, he inscribed his sheet in lithographic crayon (substituting the word \u201cRight\u201d for \u201cGood\u201d); the annotation then transferred to the stone along with the drawing.\n\nThe two portrait sketches are very slight, and it is therefore not surprising to find that the lithograph was not mentioned specifically in any of the letters exchanged by the artist and his printers. It is possible that this subject is one of two drawings (together with cat. 135) that were transferred to stone and proved by the Ways on November 26 (app. II.4). Very few proofs of this lithograph were pulled, and there were no impressions in Whistler\u2019s estate. The only impression located to date is the one acquired by Bryan Lathrop in 1913 as part of a group of lithographs purchased from T. R. Way\u2019s widow; it is now in The Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove proofing paper (223 \u00d7 143 mm).  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
