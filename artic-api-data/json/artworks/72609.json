    "description": "<p>The 1922 <em>Chicago Tribune</em> Tower competition is perhaps the most well-known contest in Chicago's architectural history.  The competition, which elicited 260 designs from firms around the world, proved to be an important international forum for attitudes about the prevailing aesthetic of the tall office building.<br>This Gothic-inspired entry by Japanese-born architect Richard Mine (1894-1981) received one of 50 honorable mentions in the competition.  Mine, a recent graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign at the time of the competition, went on to work for companies and firms such as General Motors, Kraft Foods, and Holabird, Root and Burgee.</p>\n",
