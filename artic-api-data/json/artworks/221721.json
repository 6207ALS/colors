    "description": "<p>Taryn Simon\u2019s series <em>A Living Man Declared Dead and Other Chapters</em> (2008\u201311) explores the ways in which territory, power, circumstance, or religion collide with psychological and physical inheritance. In this chapter, she follows the bloodline of Latif Yahia, an Iraqi citizen (now residing in Ireland) who claims to have been the body double for Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein\u2019s eldest son. Chosen by Iraqi security forces because of his basic resemblance, he was forced to undergo reconstructive surgery to better impersonate the ruler\u2019s son. The frame on the left features photographs of Yahia and his family (empty slots represent people who could not be photographed); the central frame contains Simon\u2019s narrative; and the frame on the right shows weapons seized by the Americans when storming Uday\u2019s palace and medals that Yahia allegedly received for his services.</p>\n",
