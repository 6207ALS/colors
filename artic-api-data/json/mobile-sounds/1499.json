    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Solitude of the Soul shows four figures, two male, two female, united only by touch, their faces are turned away from each other. The artist, Lorado Taft, explained in a letter to a friend.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR 2: &quot;The thought is that however closely we may be thrown together, by circumstance, family ties, et cetera, we are unknown to each other. We grope, we cling to each other, but our eyes are hollow. Don\u2019t think me a pessimist, I'm quite the contrary, life seems to me very beautiful. This group is merely one comment on it.<br>&lt;music&gt;<br>Man 1:  Taft wrote one of the first histories of American sculpture, and was an important teacher at the school of the Art Institute. He also ran a summer colony called &quot;Eagles Nest&quot; in Oregon, Illinois, where artists could live and work together. The Solitude of the Soul won several awards, and led to commissions for other sculptures. If you want to see more of Lorado Taft's work, look for Fountain of the Great Lakes in the South Garden of the Art Institute.&quot;</p>\n",
