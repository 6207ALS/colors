    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This dramatic painting is called &quot;The Ecstasy of St. Francis.&quot; Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: Well, this picture shows St. Francis in a state of ecstasy and it really also through its form evokes the swirl of feelings of that state, I think. But we see the saint in his rough habit, and he's been meditating upon mortality with the skull that he holds.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: As he meditates, the angel dressed in blue and white appears to him, holding a cross, spear and crown of thorns, which represent Christ's passion and death. This momentous vision causes Francis to swoon, supported by another angel.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF:  This picture is particularly interesting because it's viewed as a very important statement of the Roman art world in the beginning of the 17th century when Caravaggio was a major figure who was just starting to state his kind of revolutionary realist dramatic rhetorical form of art. And Bellini was an established artist who picked up what Caravaggio was doing, and this is in 1601, is his first and almost most Caravaggesque statement. The dramatic light that one sees that falls on the saint and illuminates the angels so starkly is really what he's learned from Caravaggio. It gives it an emotional intensity.</p>\n",
