    "transcript": "<p>Julie Simek: So one of Sargent's biggest influences and fellow artists that he spent a lot of time studying was Vel\u00e1zquez. My name is Julie Simek and I'm a conservator of paintings. And was Vel\u00e1zquez was known for his use of darks and lights to create drama within a composition. And Sargent is employing that technique here with this portrait of Charles Deering.</p>\n<p>Annelise Madsen: So Charles Deering was one of Sergent's important patrons, certainly his most important Chicago patron. I'm Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. Charles Deering would become an executive at Deering Harvesting Company, which would become International Harvester, and this painting was done many years before that, when Deering is still in the navy. And you can see in this portrait just traces of the color and shoulder details of his uniform. There isn't a dramatic background or luxurious materials that Sargent is working into his composition.</p>\n<p>Julie Simek: I mean, this is a portrait of a friend rather than a society portrait. And so, this sort of absence of a background and this absence of all these lavish details in which the sitters are usually portrayed and with the rich curtain and the rugs and all their finery around them. And again, that helps put the emphasis on Charles and it helps the viewer relate to this very intimate portrait of an acquaintance of Sargent's.</p>\n",
