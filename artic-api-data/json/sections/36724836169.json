They were pensionnaires at the Dumont auberge, located in Gloton, the riverbank hamlet of Bennecourt. \u00c9mile Zola had recently vacationed there with Paul C\u00e9zanne and other artists and had given Monet a glowing report. The modest rent and the description of the solicitous Mme Dumont must have appealed to Monet, whose financial situation in this period was precarious.\n\nScholars have generally assumed that Zola\u2019s enthusiastic recommendation was the impetus for Monet\u2019s trip to Gloton that spring. But Zola was not the only figure in Monet\u2019s circle who had discovered the charms of the area. It was a favored setting of the painter Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny, a crucial early advocate of Monet\u2019s who facilitated the inclusion of Boats Coming out of the Port of Le Havre (location unknown [W89]) in the 1868 Salon, which opened in May. Daubigny had begun his career painting landscapes in the forest of Fontainebleau; by the 1850s he was specializing in plein air river scenes, which he painted from a small boat that he had outfitted as a floating studio and nicknamed \u201cLe Botin\u201d (or little box). Several of Daubigny\u2019s ambitious canvases from the late 1850s to the early 1860s feature Gloton\u2019s riverfront rowhouses from the viewpoint of the Seine (see, e.g., fig. 14.1).\n\nBennecourt and Gloton were halfway between Rouen and Paris, reachable by way of Bonni\u00e8res-sur-Seine, which was on the Paris\u2013Le Havre railroad line, departing from the Saint-Lazare station. The easy accessibility by train surely was another factor in Monet\u2019s choice of vacation destination. Upon arrival at Bonni\u00e8res-sur-Seine one took a chain ferry to the Grande \u00cele, one of the many islets that dotted this elbow of the Seine, and from there over to Bennecourt and Gloton on the opposite bank. The Masterpiece (L'oeuvre), Zola\u2019s novel of the failed artist Charles Lantier, has a description of the riverscape of Bennecourt, whose yellow houses straggle along the river bank.\u201d Neighboring Gloton\u2019s shore was bisected by the descente du bac (see fig. 14.2), the wide path at which the ferry (bac) docked that one could follow up to the street. Daubigny depicted these very elements in River Scene (Le bac \u00e0 Gloton) (fig. 14.3), which shows Gloton on the left, and the wooded riverbank of the Grande \u00cele on the right, linked by the descente du bac and the ferry seen in the middle ground.\n\nMonet had hitherto produced only a few river scenes, and his treatment in On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt was in stark contrast to the beaches of Normandy he had painted the previous summer, with their local fishermen and fashionably dressed tourists (see, e.g., The Beach at Sainte-Adresse [cat. 13] [W92]). He may well have had Daubigny and, in particular, paintings like The Village of Gloton (fig. 14.1) in mind when he chose as a subject the very view recently depicted by Daubigny. Although Monet\u2019s scene seems compressed when compared with Daubigny\u2019s expansive vista, topographical details are still distinguishable. Monet channeled his viewpoint through Camille, who sits on the shady Grande \u00cele looking toward the descente du bac and the imposing facade of Mme Dumont\u2019s auberge, which the viewer perceives only as a watery reflection.\n\nThe sketchy, unresolved surface of the center left of On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt has generated much debate and many interpretations. Monet laid in the composition in thinly painted zones to indicate the Gloton embankment, bifurcated by the descente du bac (see Technical Report). The X-ray image indicates that Monet blocked in the river and elements of the sky and landscape before the foreground figure and tree trunks were included (fig. 14.4). The X-ray also shows that the grassy bank was extended over the water between the two trees and behind and under part of Camille\u2019s back, then roughly painted out with bright blue. At that time or soon thereafter, Monet added one or possibly two figures, fitting them on the bank of the Grande \u00cele in a very unorthodox way. The final composition is Daubigny-esque in its location only, with similar compositional details. The light, textural brushwork, compression of space, and prominent placement of Camille speak to Monet\u2019s new painterly vocabulary, resulting in an updating of Daubigny\u2019s picturesque riverbank view.\n\nFar from hidden, Monet\u2019s compositional adjustments are visible to the naked eye. Although difficult to read, pentimenti are clearly discernible in the water to the right of Camille. Mary Mathews Gedo has advanced an interpretation that at some point the Monets\u2019 ten-month-old son, Jean, was in the picture, positioned in his mother\u2019s lap, facing her with outstretched arms and holding a toy in his left hand. In Gedo\u2019s scenario, a fluffy white dog was on Camille\u2019s lap as well, which she suggests could have been the same dog Monet depicted being held by Camille in 1866 (fig. 14.5). Gedo reasons that the complications of posing an infant may have occasioned his removal. Whether the repainted area on Camille\u2019s lap (fig. 14.6) is a small dog or a baby remains in question, as does the significance of what appears to be another figure just to the right of Camille, indeed, almost occupying the same space. Monet chose not to scrape out or paint over this second figure completely, instead leaving tantalizingly telling bits of flesh color visible on the surface.\n\nAlthough Gedo identifies the pentimenti to the right of Camille as a small child, recent findings indicate that they are possibly that of a second adult. The head floating next to Camille\u2019s in the X-ray (fig. 14.7) is too large for a ten-month-old, suggesting that the painted-over figure is another adult, possibly wearing a bonnet-like hat. It is also possible that this second figure held a small baby with a bonnet, or a doll, whose face is indicated by the flesh tones discernible within the blue of the water (fig. 14.8).\n\nAbsent other drawings or preparatory sketches, we can surmise that Monet repainted as his ideas evolved, allowing traces of former arrangements to show through and sometimes integrating them into the revised imagery. Technical imaging of the work offers glimpses of the artist\u2019s process, although it does not reveal definitively the figures that were included in intermediate stages.\n\nThis trip to Gloton was the first time Camille had left Paris since the birth of Jean in August 1867. Here she is a tourist gazing out at the Seine. She is at once subject and staffage\u2014personally significant to the artist but also a functional guidepost used to direct the viewer\u2019s attention across the water. Despite her pictorial importance, she is messily handled with a wet-on-wet paint application, a result of the artist working through several compositional ideas. Her blue-and-white-striped bodice includes breaks through which one can see the blue of the river that was laid in first (fig. 14.9). Also intruding are dashes of dark green, remnants of either the earlier extended grassy bank or overhanging leaves (fig. 14.10). The streaks of blue in her dress appear at times accidental, but in some instances Monet deliberately worked them into the final composition, giving their random presence a new visual purpose.\n\nMonet\u2019s treatment of Camille\u2019s face, silhouetted against the water, is even more radical than his depiction of her figure. Scholars have suggested that it appears unfinished, raising the possibility that the artist abandoned his work on the canvas and that the signature and date are later additions. Added during a later session, her head covers the reflection of the auberge in the river (fig. 14.11). The unfinished quality of her face is in part due to a brushstroke that leaves her with a fuzzy chin line (fig. 14.12); the two columns of strokes made to highlight the back of her neck (fig. 14.13) add to the unusual way in which Camille\u2019s face in profile is captured. The left, lighter-colored strokes in particular\u2014which are thickly applied over the hairline and over the collar of her bodice\u2014look more like a ribbon, an accessory to her hatless hair that has little to do with her actual neckline. This further accentuates the blockiness of her profile, which, in concert with the exaggeratedly large, pink-red ear, gives her a monkey-like quality. Seen in an extremely foreshortened profile, she subverts the viewer\u2019s anticipated pleasure of contemplating a female figure in reverie at the water\u2019s edge.\n\nComplementing, indeed bookending, Camille as urban visitor are the two fashionable females on the opposite bank. The one wearing a pink hat is turned in profile to face a sketch pad or small easel (fig. 14.14 and fig. 14.15). The white splotch to her left has been identified as a white dog, although what should be the corresponding reflection in the river is a rather indistinguishable white splash of paint that may instead represent a tablecloth or receptacle. Both women wear voluminous garments composed of horizontal bands of color, which may have been intended to suggest the decorative flounces and the crinoline style still popular in 1868. In the figure at right in particular, the horizontal white stroke has been applied ragged wet-on-wet into the gray; the effect is that of an apron-like tulle overskirt, with a bottom edge accentuated by a fine white filigree (fig. 14.16).\n\nTo the left of this pair of fashionable women, Monet played with the paradigms of city and country, modern and traditional, leisure and work. Browns and whites suggest cows drinking (fig. 14.17), a nod, perhaps, to Daubigny\u2019s paintings at Gloton, especially the 1859 River Scene (Le bac \u00e0 Gloton) (fig. 14.3). Short, vertical brushstrokes of blue identify the cowherdess, her plain, monochrome garment contrasting with the hats and trimmed dresses of the seated amateurs de l\u2019art. In addition to the cows and cowherdess, Monet includes one of the more picturesque aspects of the site\u2014the bac, or ferry. It is the small, irregularly shaped, ocher-colored object at the far left, partially eclipsed by the overhanging trees and moored to a rust-and-blue form, which is as illegible as the reflections in the river. Easier to discern is a female passenger, seated facing the back of the boat, whose blue dress with pink hat and triangular shawl indicates that she shares the same high social status as the woman sketching on the opposite bank and suggests that she is a tourist crossing from the Grande \u00cele over to Gloton.\n\nMuch attention has been paid to whether On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt was a finished work or one that was abandoned and later signed and dated. Some scholars have concluded from the wet-over-dry addition of the signature and date and the summarily and boldly abbreviated treatment of grass and wildflowers (fig. 14.18) that the picture was reworked and signed later. In Women in the Garden (fig. 14.19) from the previous summer one sees a similar large-scale signature and shorthand treatment of the grass and wildflowers. It is thought that the Chicago painting was not exhibited until 1889, when Monet included it in the Monet-Rodin exhibition held at Galerie Georges Petit, but this does not necessarily indicate that he reworked or even returned to the canvas. Rather than a composition left incomplete, On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt, with its complex and sometimes unsettling surface, seems to have been the result of initial decisions and later changes of course, suggesting not careful premeditation but instead an organic working method.\n\nMonet\u2019s stay in Gloton came to a peremptory end on June 26 when, as he wrote to Bazille, he was \u201cthrown out of the inn,\u201d \u201cnaked as a worm.\u201d Leaving Camille and Jean with Mme Dumont, he returned to his family and patrons in Le Havre. The canvas sustained damages that appear to be quite old and may indicate Mme Dumont\u2019s hasty return of the painting along with the artist\u2019s belongings or perhaps Monet\u2019s own careless handling of this work after his summer residence was unexpectedly cut short. The relatively crude manner in which the work was repaired\u2014a tear in the upper left (fig. 14.20) and a puncture to the right of Camille (fig. 14.21) were mended with lead white paint or adhesive\u2014could be an indication that the restorations were done by Monet himself.\n\nAlthough sometimes viewed as a discrete experiment, a mere overture to the more transformative work Monet accomplished with Pierre-Auguste Renoir the following summer at La Grenoulli\u00e8re, On the Banks of the Seine, Bennecourt should be considered an immediate forerunner to those works that were concerned with reflective surfaces. Not only did Monet update the elements of river scenes explored by Daubigny, but this picture also marks the first experimentations with inverted water reflections and shadows cast by overhanging leaves, motifs that would dominate the Mornings on the Seine series (see cat. 36 [W1475]) and the later Water Lily series (see cat. 44 [W1889]).\n\nAfter considering the alterations Monet made to On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt, one may conclude that the composition began as an unpeopled riverscape before the artist reshaped it into a genre painting, now part biography, whose full meaning is painted out but is allowed to linger as flashes of underpainting. Monet staked his painterly claim on this island in the Seine, using the figure of Camille not only to lead our eye across the water but perhaps also as a stand-in for himself. Monet\u2019s struggle with the principal figures of this composition, which as shown were either altered or painted out, may suggest his own ambivalence toward his personal situation at the time. For, it was near Bennecourt where he housed his family temporarily and where he no doubt keenly felt the pressures of fatherhood (although unable to keep his household together when faced with eviction); he set out to describe the view from the other bank, using the diaphanous but critically important figure of Camille. This is a portrait of a place, revised and messily resolved through Monet\u2019s artistic lens.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt was painted on a pre-primed, no. 40 portrait (figure), standard-size linen canvas. A stamp from the color merchant Deforge[-Carpentier] was documented on the back of the original canvas before lining. The off-white ground consists of a single layer. A few charcoal particles were observed microscopically in the water on the right side of the painting, which could be related to underdrawing, but insufficient material was observed to draw any conclusions about its nature or extent. The painting was carried out in several sessions and includes some major revisions to the composition, most significantly the painting out of a figure to the immediate right of the female figure. What is perhaps the face of the painted-out figure remains partially visible through the artist\u2019s roughly-applied overpaint. The two figures appear to have been painted within a relatively short time span, and may even have coexisted within the composition at some point. Both figures were added to the work later in the painting process on top of the landscape. The tiny figures and animals on the opposite side of the river were also added later. Other changes made to the landscape include some forms on the hilltop on the right side that were subsequently covered by the sky and alterations to the foreground riverbank in the area of the female figure. It seems that some parts of the reflection in the river capture the landscape and sky at earlier painting stages, resulting in some apparent discrepancies between what is depicted in the actual landscape and what is reflected in the water. There are several old damages to the canvas and paint layers, and repairs and retouching in these areas may date to early in the painting\u2019s history.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 14.22).\n\nSigned and dated: Cl Monet 1868 (lower left, dark reddish-brown paint) (fig. 14.23). The signature and date contain similar pigments but are mixed in different proportions, as evidenced by their slightly different hues when viewed under magnification; they also exhibit a slightly different fluorescence from one another under UV, ultraviolet light (fig. 14.24). Both were applied when the underlying paint was dry.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 81 \u00d7 100 cm. This corresponds to a no. 40 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas, turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 28.7V (1.3) \u00d7 30.3H (0.8) threads/cm. It was determined that the horizontal threads correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild cusping on the left and right sides, with more pronounced cusping along the top and especially along the bottom edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1973 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced approximately 6\u20137 cm apart. It appears that the canvas was stretched slightly larger than its original dimensions, with approximately 0.5 cm of unpainted tacking margin visible on the left, right, and top edges.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 5\u20137 cm apart.\n\nCurrent: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal: Discarded. An undated pre-1973-treatment report indicates that the previous stretcher consisted of six members, including horizontal and vertical crossbars, with mortise and tenon joints and keys. The report gives the following dimensions: overall, 82 \u00d7 100 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; inside depth, 2 cm; width, 6.5 cm.\n\nThere is a supplier\u2019s stamp on the back of the original canvas, which was photographed before the painting was lined in 1973 (see Conservation History): \u201cDEFORGE . . . / COULEURS FINES / ET TOILES \u00e0 PEINDRE / [Boulevard] Montmartre, 8 / PARIS / Atelier Rue Legendre . . . Batignolles\u201d(fig. 14.25, fig. 14.26).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of the top, left, and right tacking margins but appears to stop short of the bottom edge (fig. 14.27). This indicates that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric on the top, left, and right sides; the bottom edge probably corresponds to the edge of the larger roll of canvas that was attached to the frame during priming. The canvas was probably commercially prepared. The ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 15 to 80 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 14.28).\n\nThe ground layer is off-white.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white with minor amounts of iron oxide red and yellow, and traces of bone black, alumina, calcium-based white, barium sulfate, and silicates.\n\nNo evidence of underdrawing was detected with infrared reflectography; however, a few localized areas of black particulate matter were observed microscopically in the water, on the right side of the painting (fig. 14.29). It is uncertain whether this material is related to preparatory drawing. In some areas, the black particles seem to lie on top of the paint layer and may have been picked up by the brush in the process of painting (fig. 14.30).\n\nCharcoal.\n\nIf the material is related to preparatory drawing, the amount observed on the surface of the painting is insufficient to draw any conclusions about the extent of the underdrawing or any revisions to the original compositional plan.\n\nMost of the landscape was built up in broad, relatively flat planes of color. In some areas, the paint was quite thinly applied, especially at the junctures of forms, where the ground layer remains partially exposed (fig. 14.31). It appears that the composition was laid in with thin layers of more subdued tones than those used in the final painting; for example, dull greens and earth tones are observed throughout the landscape (fig. 14.32, fig. 14.33). The underpainting of the sky varies from warm cream to pinkish-gray and continues underneath the foliage to the left edge of the painting. The brush-marked texture of this underlayer remains visible at breaks in the brushwork and through some of the thin layers of paint applied on top (fig. 14.34). The streaky, more radio-opaque forms visible in the upper-left corner seem to correspond to this underlayer (fig. 14.35). Most of the foreground bank was quickly brushed in using dilute green paint; further buildup in this area was mostly limited to the touches of white and yellow flowers (fig. 14.36). The painting was carried out in several sessions and includes both wet-over-dry and wet-in-wet paint application at various stages. The landscape was well established before any of the figures or animals were added. The female figure in the foreground, as well as the figures and animals on the other side of the river, were painted on top of the landscape, in some cases, when the brushstrokes from the landscape were already surface dry (fig. 14.37, fig. 14.38).\n\nSeveral compositional changes have been made to the painting, and some areas were never fully resolved by the artist. This makes it somewhat challenging to reconstruct the evolution of the work. It is clear, even to the unaided eye, however, that another figure was originally included in the composition immediately to the right of the female figure. This figure was subsequently painted out, but elements of what may be the head and face remain partially visible on the surface (fig. 14.39). The brushwork outlining the head, which is rather thick and suggestive of a hat or a bonnet, and the flesh-toned paint of the face can be seen through the thin layers of artist\u2019s overpaint applied on top (fig. 14.40). One interpretation of this pentimento is that the figure is a child who stands on the female figure\u2019s lap, facing out toward the viewer. There are two other localized areas of flesh-colored paint, partially visible underneath the gray, artist\u2019s overpaint further down in the composition (fig. 14.41, fig. 14.42, fig. 14.43). These areas have been interpreted as the right hand of the woman grasping the right hand of the child (on the left side) and the outstretched left hand of the child (on the right side). The recent technical examination offers an alternative interpretation for consideration, namely, that the painted-out figure is an adult female, who sits facing the viewer (fig. 14.44). The scale of the head and the facial features (which seem to be indicated by localized areas of deep-red paint partially visible on the surface) (fig. 14.45) may be more in keeping with an adult figure than a child. The radio-opaque, lead white\u2013rich strokes, which are visible in the X-ray below the head and continue down to the edge of the grassy bank, seem to be related to the body of the painted-out figure (fig. 14.46). The upper part of this white brushwork was roughly covered by the artist while the lower area was incorporated into the final painting and has sometimes been interpreted as a dog perched on the female figure\u2019s lap. Further examination of the X-ray reveals another form just below the painted-out head. It is tempting to read this as the head of an infant child or a doll wearing a bonnet (possibly cradled in the lap of the painted-out figure)\u2014and, in fact, one of the small areas of flesh-toned paint corresponds to where the face of this child or doll would be located (fig. 14.47)\u2014but this is more speculative (fig. 14.48).\n\nBoth the painted-out figure and the final female figure were painted on top of the landscape, the water, and the reflections of the buildings. In some places, the paint from the landscape was still wet. For example, the gray stroke on the left edge of the painted-out head was dragged through the still-soft paint of the corner of the reflected building and the foliage from the layers underneath (fig. 14.49). Similarly, the edge of the final female figure\u2019s right shoulder appears to be wet-in-wet with the pale-blue-gray paint layer of the water (fig. 14.50). The buildings and foliage reflected in the water continue underneath the edge of this figure\u2019s head (fig. 14.51) and are visible microscopically through drying cracks and tiny gaps in her hair (fig. 14.11); the hair appears to have been painted wet-on-wet with the thick white strokes of the building\u2019s reflection at the upper front and back of the head (fig. 14.52). It is evident, through the open brushwork of the blue-striped dress, which becomes increasingly sketchy below the figure\u2019s waist, that her body was also painted over the water, grass, and foliage (fig. 14.53). In the area of the water to the left of the figure\u2019s back, dark-green paint is sandwiched between layers of blue from the water. This seems to indicate that at one point the grassy bank was extended further out over the water on the left side of the painting (fig. 14.54, fig. 14.55). In the area between the two tree trunks, the grass itself, including one of the yellow flowers continues underneath the upper blue layer where the water was extended over the grass. Some of the dark-green paint from the earlier shoreline can still be seen through the open brushwork of the woman\u2019s dress (fig. 14.55). In this area, the green paint appears to have been applied wet-in-wet over a pale-blue layer, presumably the first painting of the river. The brighter-blue layer applied on top was added when the underlying greenery was dry. This bright-blue paint from the water continues under the figure\u2019s back, where it stands in for the blue stripes of the dress in places (fig. 14.56). The blue paint looks like it was still slightly wet in places when the dress was painted. The skirt was painted on top of the grass and some of the yellow flowers (the two at waist level), while the two lower flowers were added on top of the skirt (fig. 14.57). The pale-green patch of grass and yellow flowers left of the figure were also added later; there is some wet-in-wet mixing with the pale gray of the edge of the skirt. The bright white strokes to the right of the woman (sometimes interpreted as a dog), appear to have originally been part of the painted-out figure. The white brushwork was also applied over the brighter blue of the water and some of the dark-green and brown paint (applied wet-in-wet on top of the water) that appears to be related to a branch or vine (or reflection of such) that continues on either side of the white form (fig. 14.58). The small flesh-tone area just above the white strokes appears to lie on top of the white paint (fig. 14.59). The other flesh-colored paint stroke, further to the left, seems to have been picked up by the edge of the striped dress, suggesting that it was still wet when the dress was painted (fig. 14.60). All of these observations seem to indicate that both the final female figure and the painted-out figure were painted on top of the landscape after some changes to the shoreline had been made. Furthermore, since both figures show evidence of some wet-in-wet mixing with the landscape, they were probably painted within a short time span of one another, if not contemporaneously, suggesting that they may have coexisted in the composition at some point. It seems that the rowboat in the foreground also may not have been included in the composition from the beginning. The back part of the boat was painted on top of the first layers of the water, and the front half was added over a thin green wash that may correspond to the original lay-in of the riverbank (fig. 14.61). The grass where it overlaps the boat and the bright-blue patch of water to the right of the boat were added last in this area.\n\nThe fact that the paint used to cover the figure does not disturb the ridges of the underlying brushmarks, as well as the presence of several small areas of interlayer cleavage between the two painting campaigns (fig. 14.62), suggests that the figure was at least surface dry when the artist painted it out. The gray paint that covers the torso only overlaps the final female figure along the edge of her right arm but it seems that the paint from her dress was also dry at this point (fig. 14.63). The gray overpaint appears to have been painted up to the lower right flesh-toned area; the \u201cflesh\u201d area was then obscured by the thick, grayish-white stroke (fig. 14.64). Although it cannot be ruled out that the artist\u2019s overpaint has been thinned or compromised in past cleanings, it does seem that Monet was not overly concerned with completely concealing all traces of the earlier figure and that its presence was always visible to some extent.\n\nA few other more minor changes to the composition were observed. It appears that early in the painting, forms related to the sky, the tree foliage, and the river were laid in underneath the two tree trunks, suggesting that these compositional elements were blocked in on the left side before the tree trunks were added. However, the painting could not have been very far developed when the trunks were incorporated, as they remain relatively radio-transparent and the river and village were largely built up around them (fig. 14.65). In front of the houses near the right edge, a few other painted-out forms are visible in the transmitted IR and X-ray images. These may be related to additional windows and greenery that were later painted out (fig. 14.66); for example, a painted-out area of green can be seen, microscopically, to the left of the shrub that is in front of the white house at the far right, perhaps suggesting that more shrubbery was planned there (fig. 14.67). Further revisions appear to have been made to the sky in the upper right corner of the painting. Brushwork unrelated to the final composition is revealed with the aid of infrared and transmitted-infrared imaging (fig. 14.68). It is unclear what this earlier brushwork depicted but it seems like the warm, terracotta color of the underlayer of the hill continues underneath the sky. In the upper right corner, this warm-toned layer continues in a broad band all the way to the top of the canvas (fig. 14.69), and interestingly, in the final painting, the reflection of the sky in the river seems disrupted in this area, as though a form was being reflected there. The pale, brush-marked underpainting that initially covered most of the sky also seems to stop when it reaches this area in the upper right corner, suggesting that some form was blocked into the corner early on (fig. 14.70). The warm-toned paint of the pentimento is also visible in a small area further to the left, where there is a gap in the blue paint of the sky (fig. 14.71). This small peak also seems to have been incorporated into the reflection, suggesting that the sky was reworked after the reflection was painted. In fact, there seem to be several discrepancies between the village and its reflection; for example, more of the green hillside but not all of the buildings are included in the reflection. Furthermore, the hillside seems out of scale with the reflection of the large white building to the left. This could suggest that the reflection represents an earlier stage of the composition.\n\nSeveral damages appear to have occurred early in the painting\u2019s history. There is a large, L-shaped tear, which was repaired and filled early on using a lead white\u2013rich paint or adhesive. This shows up as a radio-opaque area in the X-ray (fig. 14.72). Another damage, possibly a small puncture in the canvas, just to the right of the painted-out figure, was treated in a similar way. The repair creates a roughly circular form on the surface of the painting (fig. 14.73, fig. 14.74). It is unclear when or by whom the repairs were carried out, however, it cannot be ruled out, that Monet himself may have had a hand in them. In any case, the nature of the retouching in the larger tear area, which is more dense and solid than the rest of the foliage, raises the question of whether the foliage was originally painted this densely. The X-ray indicates that the buildings on the far shore were painted in some detail right up to the tree trunk (fig. 14.75). It seems questionable that Monet would have developed the buildings to this degree, only to obscure them with the dense foliage. In fact, this runs counter to the technique he used to depict glimpses of sky peeking through the foliage: rather than painting broad strokes of blue sky, then adding the foliage on top, localized touches of blue were applied over the initial lay-in of the foliage, with additional leaves built up over that (fig. 14.76). Other signs of damage include gouges in the soft paint, particularly in the lower center area (fig. 14.77, fig. 14.78).\n\nBrushes, including 1\u20132 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, bone black, chrome yellow, yellow, red, and brown iron oxides including burnt sienna, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. Relatively large white clumps are visible microscopically throughout the paint surface, imparting a distinct bumpy surface (fig. 14.79). This may be associated with the lead white paint used by the artist. UV fluorescence suggests the use of red lake in the signature and date.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a relatively matte, synthetic varnish, which was applied in 1973. In the 1973 treatment, a yellowed, natural-resin varnish was removed. The application of the natural-resin varnish is not documented but must postdate the 1959 varnish removal (see Conservation History).\n\nUndocumented restorations associated with damages in the canvas (an L-shaped tear in the upper left quadrant and a possible puncture at lower center (see Condition Summary) appear to be quite old. These areas were repaired using a lead white\u2013containing material, probably applied from the front and the back of the canvas, to act as a consolidant for the tear and serve as a fill material for the retouching. The repairs were carried out before the aqueous lining that is documented as early as 1957 and was removed in the 1973 treatment (see below).\n\nIn 1959, discolored (extremely yellowish-gray) varnish was removed.\n\nIn 1973, discolored surface films and overpaint were removed (fig. 14.80). The aqueous lining was removed, along with excess lead white paint on both sides of the tear. The painting was wax-resin lined and stretched on to a new ICA spring stretcher. A coating of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied and inpainting was carried out. A coating of methacrylate resin L46 was applied, followed by a final coating of PVA AYAA.\n\nThe painting is in good condition overall but suffers from old damages and restorations. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched on an ICA spring stretcher. The spring stretcher is slightly larger than the original stretcher, resulting in a border of unpainted ground from the tacking margins around the edges. There is an L-shaped tear in the canvas, in the upper-left quadrant, in the area of dense foliage above the figure\u2019s head. It measures approximately 19 cm in the horizontal direction and 4 cm in the vertical direction. There is another damage in the foreground, just to the left of the back end of the rowboat, which appears to be a puncture in the canvas. Both areas of damage were somewhat crudely repaired with a lead white\u2013containing material. The repairs appear to be quite old and were carried out at least before the aqueous lining, which was first documented in 1957. Other small damages in the paint were observed in the area of the painted-out figure and appear to have occurred when the artist\u2019s \u201coverpaint\u201d was still soft. Retouching associated with these damages is slightly mismatched. There is extensive retouching around all of the edges associated with the border of exposed ground mentioned above. Other localized areas of retouching are scattered throughout the painting. There is a concentrated area of retouching in the upper right corner; its purpose may have been to conceal the warm-brown underlayer in that area, which may have become more noticeable over time. There are a few tiny, localized areas of interlayer cleavage between the artist\u2019s \u201coverpaint\u201d and the painted-out figure. These areas are secure. There are some areas of crushed impasto, likely the result of pressure from the lining treatments. There are some fine age cracks visible throughout the painting and a fairly extensive network of fine drying cracks in the dark green and brown paint of the trees and the sitter\u2019s head. The surface is coated with a synthetic varnish, which has a relatively matte finish.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (2008): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, mid-nineteenth-century, reverse-ogee frame with composition acanthus-leaf miters, a hollowed frieze, and a composition beaded sight molding. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and composition ornament. The torus and hollow are burnished; the rest of the gilding was left matte and retains its original glue size. There is casein overpaint on the sides of the frame. The fruitwood molding is mitered with angled dovetailed splines. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet; torus (three-quarter round) with a step; reverse ogee with composition acanthus-leaf ornament at the miter; fillet; hollow; fillet; frieze with beaded composition ornament; and cove sight (fig. 14.81).\n\nPrevious frame (removed 2008): The work was previously housed in an American (New York), mid-twentieth-century reproduction of an Italian Baroque frame with a bolection profile with spiral-leaf outer molding and a centered laurel-leaf sight molding. The frame has a white-gold distressed finish and an independent liner with a beveled sight (fig. 14.82).\n\nPrevious frame: Sometime between 1956 and 1962, the work was housed in a painted shadow box. The painting\u2019s stretcher was mounted to the back panel of the frame with the edges of the canvas exposed. The frame was probably only utilized during this installation (fig. 14.83).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by [unknown] to Louis Aim\u00e9 L\u00e9on Clapisson, Neuilly-sur-Seine, by June 21, 1889, for 500 francs.\n\nSold by Louis Aim\u00e9 L\u00e9on Clapisson, Neuilly-sur-Seine, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 21, 1892, for 1,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, May 18, 1892, for 7,500 francs.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Georges Petit, Claude Monet\u2014A.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that was given to the painting when it was exhibited at the exhibition Claude Monet\u2014A. Rodin, held June 21\u2013August 1889 at Galerie Georges Petit. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\n\nBefore June 21, 1889: Village de Bonni\u00e8res (the notebooks of L\u00e9on Clapisson.

[Art Institute of Chicago, 1910], cat. 40 or cat. 41).\n\nThis was unusual for Monet, who regularly enjoyed prolific output. He did intend to paint on this vacation, evidenced by the fact that he traveled there with at least two canvases likely purchased in Paris. The stamp of what is likely the Parisian color merchant Deforge-Carpentier was documented on the back of the original canvas (see Technical Report). The only other work Monet is known to have painted during his eight-week stay is a study of Bonni\u00e8res-sur-Seine (lost or location unknown [W111]), mentioned in Mary Mathews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grande \u00cele,\u201d in Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 82. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nBennecourt is about three miles southwest of Giverny, where Monet would later live.\n\nZola had vacationed there in 1866 and 1867; his subsequent trip to Gloton in 1868 overlapped with Monet\u2019s stay, and it was during this trip that the writer likely witnessed Monet painting en plein air. According to Rodolphe Walter, \u201cUnder the eyes of his friends [Monet brought to] fruition the masterpiece long designated as The River; see Rodolphe Walter, \u201cAux sources de l\u2019impressionnisme, Bennecourt,\u201d L\u2019oeil 393 (Apr. 1988), p. 33; translated in Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 249, n. 6.\n\nAbout Monet\u2019s pecuniary circumstances, the loss of his studio, and the disapproval of his family, see Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), pp. 72\u201373, 76.\n\nWhile Monet\u2019s Boats Coming out of the Port of Le Havre (location unknown [W89]) was included in the Salon of 1868, it was largely criticized. Monet\u2019s other submission to the salon that year, The Jetty at Le Havre (private collection [W109]), was rejected. Daubigny, in his \u201cMon salon: Le jury,\u201d was the only Salon juror to publish a review of the show that mentioned Monet favorably. Zola remembers that Daubigny\u2019s review, \u201clutt\u00e9 contre certains de ses coll\u00e8gues, au nom de la v\u00e9rit\u00e9 et de la justice.\u201d \u00c9mile Zola, Salons, quoted in Rodolphe Walter, \u201cC\u00e9zanne \u00e0 Bennecourt en 1866,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts (Feb. 1962), p. 104.

Wissman (Mellen, 2010), p. 96.\n\nRobert L. Herbert has characterized The Beach at Sainte-Adresse as Monet\u2019s \u201cfirst sustained campaign of painting that involved tourism.\u201d See Robert L. Herbert, Monet on the Normandy Coast: Tourism and Painting, 1867\u20131886 (Yale University Press, 1994), p. 9. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe descente du bac, a landmark noted on contemporary maps, allowed Rodolphe Walter to approximate the location of the scene. See Rodolphe Walter, \u201cC\u00e9zanne \u00e0 Bennecourt en 1866,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts (Feb. 1962), p. 107, fig. 3; and Walter, \u201cAux sources de l\u2019impressionnisme, Bennecourt,\u201d L\u2019oeil 393 (Apr. 1988), pp. 33, 34.\n\nThe toy mentioned by Gedo seems more likely the result of a repair around a small puncture in the canvas, which appears as a rounded object. See Technical Report.\n\nCharles Stuckey also mentions the possibility of a white dog; see Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cMonet et la vision immediate (Monet and the Act of Vision),\u201d in Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Monet, l\u2019oeil impressionniste/Monet, the Impressionist\u2019s Eye, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet/Hazan, 2008), p. 39. Stuckey later suggests that the painting is \u201cunfinished\u201d and that the direction in which the composition was heading was possibly too \u201cCorot-esque.\u201d See Stuckey, \u201cJean-Baptiste Camille Corot, Ville-d\u2019Avray: The Birch,\u201d in From Corot to Monet: The Ecology of Impressionism, ed.

Gedo cites a fascinating episode in \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s The Masterpiece (L\u2019oeuvre), in which Charles Lantier attempts to pose his infant son in his mother\u2019s arms but finally gives up, admitting, \u201cChildren aren\u2019t made for that sort of thing.\u201d Translated in Mary Mathews Gedo in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grande \u00cele,\u201d in Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 84. For the original French passage, see \u00c9mile Zola, L\u2019oeuvre (G. Charpentier, 1886), pp. 199\u2013200: \u201cUn jour que Jacques sanglotait, en refusant de tenir la pose, Christine dit doucement: \u2018Mon ami, tu le fatigues, ce pauvre mignon,\u2019 Alors, Claude s'emporta, plein de remords. \u2018Tiens! c\u2019est vrai, je suis stupide, avec ma peinture! . . . Les enfants, ce n'est pas fait pour \u00e7a.\u2019\u201d\n\nCharcoal particles were identified in the water on the right side of the painting, which may indicate the presence of some underdrawing, but nothing was detected with infrared reflectography (see Technical Report).\n\n\u201cThe far bank and the river fill the woman\u2019s field of vision. The surface of the water is unruffled. The reflections are intact. What she sees, and what we see with her, is a world of reflections, a watery, upside-down world of pure visibility that only exists in the eye and under these conditions.\u201d In Andrew Forge, Monet, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), p. 16.\n\nCharles F. Stuckey, \u201cMonet et la vision imm\u00e9diate (Monet and the Act of Vision),\u201d in Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Monet, l\u2019oeil impressionniste/Monet, the Impressionist\u2019s Eye, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet/Hazan, 2008), p. 37.\n\nMary Mathews Gedo suggests that this is \u201cthe most unflattering image of Camille he would ever create\u2014a depiction that unduly emphasizes her least attractive feature, her prominent chin, and makes her upper torso seem too heavy for her lower body.\u201d See Mary Mathews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grande \u00cele,\u201d in Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 84.\n\nMary Mathews Gedo compares Camille to the mythical Ariadne, abandoned by Theseus on the island of Naxos. See Mary Mathews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grande \u00cele,\u201d in Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), pp. 84\u201385. On Camille as a symbol of nature \u201crooted\u201d to the spot, see Robert Gordon and Andrew Forge, Monet (Abrams, 1983), p. 74.\n\nCharles Stuckey suggests that on the opposite shore of Monet and his model can be seen two seated sketchers with a little white dog; see Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cMonet et la vision imm\u00e9diate (Monet and the Act of Vision),\u201d in Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Monet, l\u2019oeil impressionniste/Monet, the Impressionist\u2019s Eye, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet/Hazan, 2008), p. 39.\n\nBirgit Haase, \u201cClaude Monet, Women in the Garden,\u201d in Gloria Groom, ed., Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 103.\n\nCuriously, Monet carefully marks the reflections of these dresses with a splotch of white, then blue, topped by the pink hat. For the woman in gray, the reflected tower of pink (possibly a scarf), gray, and white has an additional pink stroke\u2014one that does not correspond to her outfit but may be the projection of the pink hat from her companion, added to play a role in unifying this vignette made up of a few strokes of paint.\n\nI am grateful to Genevieve Westerby, Research Assistant in the Department of Medieval through Modern European Painting and Sculpture, for having suggested this Daubigny-Monet comparison.\n\nMary Mathews Gedo suggests that Monet may have retouched the canvas later, but she remains uncertain regarding when or where these retouches could have been made. See Mary Mathews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grande \u00cele,\u201d in Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 8.

(Skira/Rizzoli, 2010), p. 210.\n\nIn the case of Women in the Garden, the work is signed Claude Monet, but it is not dated. For On the bank of the Seine, Bennecourt, there is an abbreviated signature, Cl. Monet, but it is dated. For more on Monet\u2019s signatures and a brief analysis of the signature used for On the Bank of the Seine, see Jeanne-Marie David, \u201cUne \u00e9tude de la signature de Claude Monet,\u201d Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Kunsttechnologie und Konservierung 22, 2 (2008), pp. 300\u201307. David suggests that the abbreviated signature indicates that Monet consciously left this work in a state of \u201cesquisse\u201d; however unfinished it may seem, for Monet it was complete. On Monet\u2019s attitudes toward finish, see John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 157\u201366.\n\nWhen On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt was exhibited at the Monet-Rodin exhibition at Galerie Georges Petit, the exhibition catalogue listed the work as in the collection of M. Clapisson. It is not known when Monet sold the painting to the collector Louis Aim\u00e9 Clapisson, but an entry titled \u201cVillage de Bonnieres\u201d in Clapisson\u2019s account book suggests that it was either sold to him by Monet or through a \u201cpetit marchand ou particuliar\u201d close to the artist some time before the opening of the Monet-Rodin exhibition. See Anne Distel to Gloria Groom, September 3, 2013, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago, and Provenance.\n\n\u201cJe viens d\u2019\u00eatre mis \u00e0 la porte de l\u2019auberge o\u00f9 j\u2019\u00e9tais, et cela nu comme un ver.\u201d See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), p. 425, letter 40; translated in Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 77.\n\nFor the details of this episode, see Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 83.\n\nIn a letter to \u00c9mile Zola, the landscape painter Antoine Guillemet, who was also staying at the Dumont\u2019s auberge, relayed that although Monet paid Dumont 400 francs toward his bill, he also left two promissory notes for the remaining amount due. Guillemet said further that Dumont was \u201cgoing to send all their [the Monets\u2019] effects to Le Havre.\u201d See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 293, pi\u00e8ce justificative (transcription of A.

Zola, July 17, 1868); translated in Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 83.\n\nThe repair in the trees was done early. Kimberley Muir speculates that it could have been stitched together or patched or relined it but instead it was covered over with a putty-like spread of lead white paint or adhesive (see Technical Report).\n\nThe number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe stamp is abraded and only Deforge is legible in the line containing the supplier\u2019s name; however, the stamp is probably that of Deforge-Carpentier, which operated under that name between 1858 and 1869, according to St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 52\u201353, 62\u201363.\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nJeanne-Marie David, \u201cUne \u00e9tude de la signature de Claude Monet,\u201d ZKK 22, 2 (2008), pp. 300\u2013307, discusses the significance of the placement of the signature in this work.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixtures used for the signature and the date contain vermilion and red lake, and probably iron oxides. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bennecourt\\_22\\_427\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Feb. 11, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" May 14, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting are based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of factors such as restretching of the canvas on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, On the Bank of the Seine, Bennecourt (W110/1922.427),\u201d Aug. 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. It was also noted that there was no visible manufacturer\u2019s information on the stretcher. A second report (undated, but also predating the 1973 treatment) describes a similar \u201cBuck type #2\u201d stretcher with mortise and tenon, keyable joints and vertical and horizontal crossbars, but gives the following dimensions: overall, 79 \u00d7 92 cm; outside depth, 1.8 cm; inside depth, 1.6 cm; width, 7.6 cm. The large discrepancy in the overall dimensions suggests that the second set of measurements is probably erroneous. See examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlthough partially illegible, the stamp is probably that of the color merchant Deforge-Carpentier. See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 52\u201353, 62\u201363. The original canvas back is covered by the lining fabric. The canvas stamp was not visible when the painting was viewed with transmitted light.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThere is a significant amount of abrasion and loss of the ground layer on the tacking margins, especially at the bottom edge. Some remnants of whitish material were observed near the edge of the bottom tacking margin but it was unclear whether this was from the ground.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 14, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 18, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bennecourt\\_22\\_427\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Feb. 11, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nCharcoal was identified by PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 14, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThese forms could be indications of clouds at an earlier stage in the painting process.\n\nSee, for example, Mary Matthews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grand \u00cele,\u201d in Mary Matthews Gedo, Monet and His Muse (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 79; see also fig. 5.3 and fig. 5.5 for the authors\u2019 proposed reconstruction of the earlier composition.\n\nSee Mary Matthews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grand \u00cele,\u201d in Mary Matthews Gedo, Monet and His Muse (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 79.\n\nSee Mary Matthews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grand \u00cele,\u201d in Mary Matthews Gedo, Monet and His Muse (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 79. If the painted-out figure was an adult female, it is conceivable that the white brushwork represented her dress, although, in that case, it was not developed very far.\n\nIt should perhaps also be considered that some of this dark-green paint may have represented the reflection of foliage from the trees in the water.\n\nSee Mary Matthews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grand \u00cele,\u201d in Mary Matthews Gedo, Monet and His Muse (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 79.\n\nGedo has interpreted the repair as a toy or some other circular object held by the child in the earlier composition, see Mary Matthews Gedo, in collaboration with William Conger, \u201cAriadne on the Grand \u00cele,\u201d in Mary Matthews Gedo, Monet and His Muse (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 79.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, bone black, chrome yellow, iron oxides including burnt sienna, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scraping samples taken in 1976 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 14, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_427\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 18, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bennecourt\\_22\\_427\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Feb. 11, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.

Rodin at Galerie Georges Petit, June 21\u2013Sept. 21, 1889, as Au bord de l\u2019eau; Bennecourt; see Galerie Georges Petit, Claude Monet; A. Rodin, exh. cat. (Imp. de l\u2019Art, 1889), p. 28, cat. 7. Reprinted in Theodore Reff, ed., Miscellaneous Group Exhibitions, Modern Art in Paris 34 (Garland, 1981), n.pag. According to Anne Distel, the painting can be identified as Village de Bonni\u00e8res in Clapisson\u2019s notebooks. The price he paid is listed in the notebooks, but it is not known from whom he purchased the painting. See Anne Distel, \u201cAppendix II: The Notebooks of L\u00e9on Clapisson,\u201d in Colin B. Bailey, with the assistance of John B. Collins, Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Canada/Yale University Press, 1997), p. 352. While Clapisson did not record the date of purchase, Distel further suggests that\u2014based on the dates associated with each notebook, and how Clapisson recorded purchases in each book\u2014the painting was possibly purchased between 1879 and 1882. See Anne Distel to the Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 3, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe transaction is recorded in the Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1891 (no. 2127, as Argenteuil), as confirmed by Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 5, 2010, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. The transaction is also recorded in L\u00e9on Clapisson\u2019s notebook, see Anne Distel, \u201cAppendix II: The Notebooks of L\u00e9on Clapisson,\u201d in Colin B. Bailey, with the assistance of John B. Collins, Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat.

The dates of this exhibition are unclear. Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Claude Monet\u2014Auguste Rodin: Centenaire de l\u2019exposition de 1889, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e Rodin, 1989), p. 19, reports that the exhibition was held from June 21 to August 1889. In Roger Terry Dunn, \u201cThe Monet-Rodin Exhibition at the Galerie Georges Petit in 1889\u201d (Ph.D. diss., Northwestern University, 1978), pp. 74\u201376, Dunn found evidence that the exhibition lasted for three months. The dates used in the present catalogue reflect Dunn\u2019s research; these dates are also used in Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 218.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue does not list dates for the exhibition. For dates, see Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cApproaching Exhibitions,\u201d Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 3, 4 (Apr. 1910), p. 51; which lists the original dates as May 10\u2013June 8. A subsequent publication says the exhibition was extended to November; see Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cAnnouncement: The Art Institute of Chicago: Exhibitions, Lectures, Musicales, Receptions, Etc., for the Season of 1910\u201311,\u201d Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 4, 2 (Oct. 1910), p. 23.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue lists the dates as June 1\u2013November 1, 1933, but newspaper articles confirm that the exhibition opened on May 23. See India Moffett, \u201cArt Show of 1,500 World Famous Treasures Is Opened at Institute,\u201d Chicago Daily Tribune, May 23, 1933, p. 17; and Virginia Gardner, \u201cRecord Throng of 1,367,000 Views Art Show,\u201d Chicago Daily Tribune, Oct. 29, 1933, p. 7.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue lists the dates as June 1\u2013November 1, 1934, but newspaper articles confirm that the exhibition closed on October 31. See \u201cFair Art Exhibition Closes Forever at 5:30 This Afternoon,\u201d Chicago Daily Tribune, Oct. 31, 1934, p. 2; and \u201cShippers Start Dismantling Art Exhibition Today,\u201d Chicago Daily Tribune, Nov. 1, 1934, p. 3.\n\nThere was no catalogue produced for the exhibition, but a typewritten checklist in the Saint Louis Art Museum Archives includes two paintings with the title Argenteuil. Exhibition dates were published in the Bulletin of the City Art Museum of St. Louis 19, 2 (Apr. 1934), p. 27. Thanks to Clare Vasquez, Public Services :ibrarian, Richardson Library, Saint Louis Art Museum, for sending this documentation. Curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. The painting was on loan to this exhibition, as Argenteuil, according to shipping order 18752, on file in Institutional Archives, Art Institute of Chicago; and receipt of object 5717, on file in Museum Registration, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue is printed in Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cCatalogue,\u201d Art Institute of Chicago Quarterly 51, 2 (Apr. 1, 1957), pp. 33\u201334. Under \u201cExhibitions\u201d in the same issue, the exhibition dates were listed as April 1\u201330 (p. 36); however, the show was extended until June 15. See Edith Weigle, \u201cThe Wonderful World of Art,\u201d Chicago Daily Tribune, May 26, 1957, p. E2, for an exhibition review and reference to the extension of the length of the show. The April 1957 issue of the Art Institute of Chicago Quarterly was largely dedicated to the Monet works in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The exhibition marked the first time the Art Institute\u2019s thirty Monet paintings were shown together in the museum.\n\nThe catalogue lists the closing date as February 9, 1997, but in fact the exhibition was extended for two weeks.
