Serious signs of abuse were reported at least eight times to the Child Welfare Agency by teachers and social workers after her mother gained custody. \n\nOn November 22, 1995, Elisa, then six years old, was beaten to death by her mother. At her funeral the Reverend Gianni Agosinelli told mourners that \u201cElisa was not killed only by the hand of a sick individual but by the impotence and silence of many, by the neglect of child welfare institutions, and by the moral mediocrity that has intoxicated our neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
