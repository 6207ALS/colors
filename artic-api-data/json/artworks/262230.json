    "description": "<p>Born in Vienna, in 1911, Glass was initially trained as an architect, although he found early success designing interiors and furnishings for Vienna\u2019s bohemian elite. However, after immigrating to New York City in 1938, he established a career as a furniture and product designer. Glass moved to Chicago in 1942 and soon opened his own design firm, Henry P. Glass Associates. In addition to running his own business, Glass was a professor of industrial design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for more than twenty years. This collection contains the original manuscript for Glass\u2019s book Design and the Consumer, as well as his teaching lecture notes, product advertisements, brochures, and photographs. This collection was used in preparation for an exhibition of Glass\u2019s work organized by the Art Institute of Chicago in 1999.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Glass,%20Henry%20P.,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Glass,%20Henry%20P.,%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
