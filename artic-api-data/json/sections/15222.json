The war had taken its toll on many businesses as the US War Production Board rationed the manufacture of metals for civilian goods. Between 1941 and 1945, Gorham Manufacturing Company, one of the nation\u2019s leading makers and retailers of fashionable silver, cut its production of silver hollowware by 70 percent, committing its services to the war effort by making metal parts for torpedoes, tanks, and small arms. During the 1950s and 1960s, faced with the challenge of stimulating market growth, Gorham embarked on an ambitious design program to transform its product lines with an influx of new forms and patterns.\n\nOne of the designers whom the firm recruited in this effort was Ohio-born Donald Colflesh. A recent graduate of Pratt University, Colflesh had trained at the Cleveland Institute of Art under the studio silversmith Frederick Miller. As Miller was celebrated for his free-flowing, biomorphic vessels, it was likely at this time that Colflesh gained an appreciation for unique silver forms that challenged the conventions of traditional hollowware. Yet the futuristic aesthetic of Colflesh\u2019s Circa \u201970 line was certainly informed by more than Miller\u2019s organic approach to raising silver. As Amy Miller Dehan asserts, Colflesh came of age at a time when the vision of the future aligned with an investigation of the universe\u2014space as the next frontier. While fantasies of outer space had long existed in popular culture, these imaginings took on a newfound dimension amid the US-Soviet space race. Just a year before Colflesh began work on the Circa \u201970 series, the Soviet satellite Sputnik was launched, followed by the US Explorer I and Vanguard I in 1958.\n\nThe excitement and optimism engendered by space exploration became more than a childhood fantasy with the emergence of a full-blown space-age consumer culture. Cosmic clothes, cars, architecture, and everyday objects began to flood the market, offering tangible links to pathbreaking scientific and technological advancements. Colflesh reflected this zeitgeist in the sweeping curves and dynamic angles of his Circa \u201970 line for Gorham, which included tea and coffee service items as well as candelabra, bowls, and a pitcher/mixer and spoon. The upward lines of the bodies, spouts, and handles convey the promise of aerodynamics, while their low, wide bases and sharp shoulders suggest the playful forms of flying saucers. The attenuated ebony finials and handles offset the sleek, highly polished finishes, which further enhance the service\u2019s cosmic sensibility in their allusion to the reflective surfaces of satellites and other spacecraft.\n\nGorham reinforced such associations in accompanying promotional literature, noting the service\u2019s \u201cfeeling of vertical motion . . . the upward look to space.\u201d Yet the company was also careful to position the set as timeless in its marketing campaign. A New Yorker advertisement for the service (see fig. 100.1) pronounced it something that would be \u201ca joy to own today, tomorrow, forever.\u201d  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom of each (fig. 100.2)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">With Wright (2009), lot 225.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2009.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">C.
