It was executed at Magagnosc, near Grasse, where my parents had rented a pretty villa on the side of the mountain.\u201d Indeed, in January 1900 Renoir\u2019s wife, Aline; their five-year-old son, Jean; his nanny, Gabrielle; and \u201cLa Boulang\u00e8re\u201d (Marie Dupuis, who served as both family cook and artist\u2019s model) joined the artist at the Villa Raynaud, near Magagnosc, for a four-month stay. Renoir had been spending winters in the south of France for many years, seeking in the milder climate some relief from his advancing rheumatoid arthritis. His residence in Magagnosc followed treatment for this illness in Aix-les-Bains in the Savoie, which he procured on the advice of his doctor, \u00c9mile Baudot.\n\nThe year 1900 would prove a remarkable one for the artist. In January the Bernheim-Jeune brothers, Gaston and Josse, held their first Renoir exhibition of sixty-eight works in Paris; by March Renoir promised his art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, a crate of paintings for an exhibition planned the next year; and in May and June eleven of the artist\u2019s paintings were featured at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. That August the artist was officially recognized by the French State with the prestigious Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur. He then returned to Magagnosc with his family in November, where they apparently stayed until March or April 1901.\n\nJean was accustomed to modeling for his father (see, for example, fig. 24.1 [Dauberville 2377]), though when the boy was little Renoir would often wait until he was occupied with something on his own and then take the opportunity to capture the moment. As Jean later recorded, these impromptu sessions gave rise to paintings of him eating soup, playing with toy soldiers, or building blocks, looking at a picture book, and other such scenes of daily life.\n\nIn January 1900 Renoir presented a portrait of Jean (fig. 24.2 [Dauberville 2380]) to the mayor of Limoges, the city of the artist\u2019s birth. Signed and dated 1899, this simple bust portrait seems a conservative choice for the second French public collection in which the renowned Impressionist painter was to be represented. However, Renoir ably demonstrates his skill as a colorist in this portrait, playing up the correspondence between Jean\u2019s red-gold hair and the pink tones of the blouse, both of which contrast with the blue collar and the boy's large blue eyes.\n\nCompared to the Limoges portrait, Jean Renoir Sewing shows the artist\u2019s son more informally dressed in a pink smock. Here Jean is perhaps posed near a window, as he appears to be bathed in natural light. The boy is shown sewing, a subject Renoir usually reserved for female sitters in genre paintings. Jean later recalled that it was Gabrielle who suggested that, to keep himself occupied during this particular modeling session, he should sew a satinette coat for the painted tin camel given to him by Monsieur Raynaud, the owner of the villa in Magagnosc.\n\nThe Renoirs followed the bourgeois fashion of letting the hair of preschool-age boys grow long over the shoulders, and the artist took advantage of the opportunities for coloristic exploration afforded by his son\u2019s abundant red-gold hair. While Jean\u2019s parents thought nothing of tying the boy\u2019s hair back with a brightly colored ribbon to keep it out of his eyes, Jean\u2019s recollection of being teased about his long hair by the neighborhood children suggests that the Renoir family may have taken the fashion to an extreme. In Jean Renoir Sewing, Renoir combined a variety of earth tones with touches of rose and bright yellow highlights to give Jean\u2019s hair an angelic glow, and the yellow of the bow serves as a striking accent.\n\nThe entire household was present in 1901 when seven-year-old Jean\u2019s hair was cut, as required for his entry into the Jesuit Coll\u00e8ge Sainte-Croix in Neuilly that autumn. This dramatic rite of passage in which Jean lost the beautiful red-gold locks that had obsessed his father did not diminish Jean\u2019s charm as a young boy nor exempt him from further modeling duties. In October 1901 Renoir and his family moved into an apartment at 43, rue Caulaincourt, in Montmartre, where Jean remembered posing most frequently. One of the paintings executed there showing Jean with his schoolboy look, Jean Renoir Drawing (fig. 24.3 [Dauberville 2389]), is dominated by subdued earth tones\u2014a concession, perhaps, to the reality that Jean\u2019s hair could no longer inspire a colorist\u2019s vivid palette.\n\nIn its dual role as portrait and genre scene, Jean Renoir Sewing was planned as a more ambitious undertaking than the smaller bust portrait of Jean that Renoir gave to Limoges. The artist chose a half-length format to portray his subject. The additional area of a no. 10 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas enabled him to accommodate the arms, the hands, and a larger portion of the torso. The positions of the arms anchor the composition, and apparent alterations to the arms, including narrowing the right sleeve to make it less voluminous and moving the left arm slightly outward (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report), served to strengthen the triangular symmetry of the pose. Renoir originally painted a larger bow, as in the Limoges portrait. The long, animated tails are still visible through the blue background paint used to cover them. Reducing the size of the bow further enhanced the triangular line of the composition.\n\nThere exists a second version of Jean Renoir Sewing (fig. 24.4 [Dauberville 2375]), which now resides in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne. Renoir made multiple versions of a painting on a few occasions. In 1876 he made a second version of Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (1876; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 438; Dauberville 211]) that was acquired by the collector Victor Chocquet, and in 1892 he prepared five variations of Girls at the Piano for selection by Henri Roujon, the Minister of Fine Arts. There is no record of why Renoir felt compelled to paint two versions of Jean Renoir Sewing. The two paintings are generally thought to have been executed at about the same time. Both canvas supports are coated with two layers of commercially prepared ground and have very similar thread counts and variations in weave density, indicating that the canvases were probably purchased at the same time (see Weave in the technical report). Both paintings also feature numerous adjustments and compositional changes, which would not be expected in a later copy.\n\nA close stylistic comparison of the two paintings reveals subtle differences. The poses vary slightly, and revisions indicate that the artist altered the composition in both works, specifically in the bow, hair, sleeves, hands, chin, and chair. Both also show evidence of similar techniques, such as scraping, repainting, and wrinkling of the paint due to the application of more paint before the previous layer had dried. Variations in brushwork, color, and modeling can also be seen in both works, for example, in the face and the hair around it (fig. 24.5). In the Chicago version Renoir used cooler tones to indicate shadows under the chin and around the nose and eyes. The warmth of these shadows in the Wallraf-Richartz version minimizes their abruptness, and as a result the details of the face appear more evenly blended and less sharply delineated. In the Chicago painting, the shadows are more saturated and there is greater red tonality in the smock and hair. In comparison, the flesh tones in the Wallraf-Richartz version appear subdued to a pinkish tone, with an overall lighter tonality in the face and smock. The backgrounds, too, are different; Renoir applied thin, translucent blue layers across the background in the Wallraf-Richartz painting, leaving some of the white ground visible for a watercolor-like appearance. In the Chicago version the background is slightly darker and more opaque, with less light on the right side of the picture. Perhaps the most striking difference between the portraits is the intensity and angle of the light: the Chicago version exhibits directional, almost raking light from the top left; in the Wallraf-Richartz version the figure is bathed in even, almost ambient light. The overall effect of the execution in the Wallraf-Richartz version is a more harmonious relationship between the figure and the ground.\n\nThroughout his career Renoir excelled at painting children, from the portrait of the nine-year-old Romaine Lacaux in 1864 (fig. 24.6 [Daulte 12; Dauberville 489]) to the inclusion of children in adult situations or genre paintings, such as Two Sisters (On the Terrace) (1881; cat. 11), which enhances the subject\u2019s theme of lighthearted leisure. Renoir\u2019s great gift as a painter of children was recognized at his first retrospective exhibition in April 1883, organized by Durand-Ruel, where the first gallery was devoted exclusively to images of children. Despite critical approval, not everyone understood Renoir\u2019s portraits of children. The artist\u2019s friend and patron Paul Berard claimed that Renoir\u2019s 1883 portrait of his daughter Lucie (cat. 16) left visitors to his apartment with a feeling of unease, in spite of its privileged location in a prime spot in his study and its presentation in a specially made frame. Unlike children whose portraits were painted in the more traditional styles of the time, whose likenesses would perhaps have been more pleasing to Berard\u2019s visitors, Renoir\u2019s children occupy a world apart, a utopian realm free of adult expectations or responsibilities, an Impressionist world filled with light and color.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began this portrait of his son Jean on a no. 10 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas that was commercially primed with a double preparation; now darkened from age and treatment, the ground was probably once a soft or semitranslucent white. A few lines visible in the infrared images suggest that the artist began with a contour sketch, possibly in charcoal or black chalk, but subsequent rubbing and scraping of the paint layers obscured the extent of this process and the exact nature of the underdrawing material. The work is marked by changes and reconsiderations, as Renoir repeatedly scraped back and painted over previous compositional choices throughout. In many places, the surface exhibits a strange, pockmarked texture that is the result of this scraping process: the paint covering the high points of the canvas was preferentially removed, leaving hard-edged, circular depressions. Elsewhere the high medium content and repeated applications of paint are evident in widespread wrinkling, especially in Jean\u2019s hair. Renoir made numerous changes to the figure, including the placement of the hands and fingers, the curve of the arms and the volume of the sleeves, the length and arrangement of the child\u2019s curls and bow, and the angle of his face. The painting is signed by the artist at the lower left and is currently lined and varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 24.7).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. (lower left, in brown paint) (fig. 24.8, fig. 24.9).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were approximately 55 \u00d7 46.3 cm, according to 1968 pretreatment measurements. This closely corresponds to a no. 10 portrait (figure) standard-size (55 \u00d7 46 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 20.1V (0.5) \u00d7 16.4H (0.6) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nCusping corresponds to the placement of the original tacks.\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1972, the original dimensions were increased slightly on all sides (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 5\u20137 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.4 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Five-member, blind mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a horizontal crossbar. Depth: Approximately 1.4 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: original stretcher (discarded); partial transcription in conservation file  \nMethod: ovular stamp/stencil  \nContent: 35 Rue Victor-Mosse [sic] (fig. 24.10)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground is a two-layer commercial preparation that extends to the edges of the tacking margins. The first layer varies in thickness (approximately 5\u201360 \u00b5m) and somewhat fills the interstices of the weave, while the second is thicker (approximately 20\u201385 \u00b5m) and moderately coats the high points of the canvas (fig. 24.11).\n\nDue to saturation by both the ground medium and the wax-resin lining material, the first ground layer, revealed mostly over the thread tops in areas of abrasion, appears translucent under stereomicroscopic examination. This layer has a whitish haze and is heavily influenced by the color of the underlying canvas. The second ground layer appears almost beige; this is largely the combined effect of the darkening of the medium, the accumulation of grime, and saturation from the lining material and varnish, as almost no colored particles are visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 24.12, fig. 24.13). Additionally, the perception of the translucent layers is affected by the color of the canvas, and the ground appears warmer as a result. It is likely that the ground was a brighter, but still soft, semitranslucent white during the artist\u2019s lifetime (fig. 24.14).\n\nThe first ground layer is composed primarily of calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of complex magnesium- and aluminum-containing silicates, or clays. The second ground layer is a mixture of lead white and calcium carbonate (natural chalk with associated microfossils), with traces of associated complex silicates, silica, and alumina. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nThe infrared image shows a few stray lines in a thin, dark medium that could be an underdrawing, but Renoir\u2019s technique of scraping back the paint to make compositional changes obscured the nature of these lines as well as their prevalence (fig. 24.15). The lines appear predominantly in the figure\u2019s lower curls and around his eyes.\n\nThe infrared image suggests that the possible underdrawing consists of a very thin, dark medium, possibly charcoal or black chalk. It is, however, unclear at this time whether the material was applied in a dry or fluid medium.\n\nThere is no evidence of changes in the compositional planning stage (see Paint Layer).\n\nRenoir made numerous changes throughout the execution of this portrait of his son Jean, constantly painting over previous work, scraping back paint, and repainting. In many cases the sequence of changes is not immediately apparent; it is, however, clear that the artist made numerous small adjustments to the figure\u2019s arms, smock-like garment, fingers, hair, and bow, as well as to the angle of his head. Repeated scraping to remove earlier compositional choices resulted in a strange, almost pockmarked surface texture in which the high points of the canvas weave form the low points in the painting: as the palette knife cut across the surface, the paint on the high points of the canvas was preferentially removed, while that in the interstices remained and was built up above the neighboring thread tops in successive layers (fig. 24.16). In other areas, Renoir used scraping to return to previous compositional choices he had painted out, as seen in the child\u2019s hair bow (fig. 24.17). The artist also varied the medium content and the working of his paint, employing extra oil and using a soft brush for the flat first layers of the child\u2019s hair, the flesh tones, and the blue background; thicker, paste-like paint and stiffer, flat brushes for the highlights throughout the hair and garment; and paint thinned with spirits, which sank into the preexisting paint and canvas textures, in the deep red and brown shadows in the garment.\n\nThe infrared, transmitted-infrared, and X-ray images indicate that Renoir moved Jean\u2019s arms many times, subtly adjusting them to bring the right arm closer to the body, while moving the left arm slightly away. The X-ray and transmitted-infrared images most clearly show the changes related to the figure\u2019s right sleeve and arm: originally the sleeve was wider, extended further to the left, and belled out lower. Although scraped back and covered with blue background paint, some of the wider profile is still visible along the right edge of the sleeve (fig. 24.18). The child\u2019s hands were at one point slightly to the right of their current position, with his left fingers more curled, and the fabric he sews covering more of his lap. Some hints of the fingers\u2019 previous position can be seen under normal viewing conditions, especially around the thumbs (fig. 24.19). Jean\u2019s left sleeve originally appeared slightly less voluminous and may have had a few more folds along the edges, as opposed to the generally round outline in the final composition. In addition to scraping back paint to adjust the volume and position of the sleeves, Renoir periodically reinforced the new contours with additional highlights. Stereomicroscopic examination of the surface also indicates that the child\u2019s garment extended farther to the right near the bottom edge but was scraped back by the artist and painted over with yellow-brown paint (fig. 24.20). The chair, as well as the brown area on the lower left, may have been added later, as the blue background is visible beneath them in many areas, including to the immediate right of Jean\u2019s shoulder. On the lower left, the volume of the garment was adjusted again and made larger, so that it covers both the blue background and earlier earthy browns.\n\nRenoir also adjusted the angle of Jean\u2019s face, as well as the volume and arrangement of his curls and the size and shape of the yellow bow in his hair. Faint underdrawing lines visible in the infrared image suggest that the curls were slightly longer initially; the infrared and transmitted-infrared images also indicate that the hair had slightly less volume on the right and more on the left and near the crown of the head. To the right of the head, thinly painted, gauzy curls were added on top of the preexisting background. On the left, the bow was adjusted and the hair was brought in more tightly toward it. The size and arrangement of the yellow bow may have been changed several times; it appears largest in the X-ray, with a prominent, round loop on the left and a long, diagonal piece of ribbon extending down to the level of the child\u2019s chin. As the artist rearranged Jean\u2019s curls to obscure more of the bow, he partially scraped back some of the earlier choices, then brought in additional blue background paint. Ultimately Renoir settled somewhere in the middle, scraping back some of the added blue paint to reveal the upper loop of the bow. The hair itself appears thickly painted and was adjusted numerous times. The extent of the wrinkling in the hair suggests that the artist did not scrape in this area but merely continued to add paint on top of still-soft, medium-rich paint layers to achieve the desired arrangement; the bright orange and yellow highlights throughout the hair, as well as the added ear on the right, show the most wrinkling (fig. 24.21).\n\nJean\u2019s head appears slightly wider and perhaps more tucked toward his chest in the transmitted- and reflected-infrared images. His collar started lower and may have been more substantial, with a stiff, diagonal edge visible on the left. Other features of his face, especially the mouth, were probably adjusted as Renoir changed the angle of the head; the infrared images seem to show pentimenti in this area, but the specific nature of these changes is unclear.\n\nFlat and round brushes with strokes up to 0.5 cm wide; very fine, soft brushes used for details such as the eyelashes; palette knife for scraping.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, Naples yellow, iron oxide yellow, terre verte, vermilion, red lake, and bone black.\n\nPigment analysis suggests that the mixtures vary greatly in complexity, with some, such as those used in the child\u2019s garment, quite simple. Three separate samples of the garment indicate the presence of vermilion, red lake, and lead white in various combinations. The flesh tones, similarly, are predominantly vermilion and lead white with possible additions of Naples yellow and trace amounts of black. The gray area of the fabric Jean sews, however, is a complex mixture including lead white, Naples yellow light, bone black, iron oxide yellow, cobalt blue, and vermilion.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a synthetic varnish with residues of natural-resin varnish in the interstices of the paint layer. The natural-resin varnish was applied at an unknown date and removed in 1972. It is unclear whether Renoir himself would have varnished this painting.\n\nThe painting\u2019s condition was first documented in 1955, when it was described as having rebate abrasion around the perimeter and very thin paint overall. In September 1956, abrasion around the edges and paint losses along the right edge from contact with the frame rebate were noted, and the painting was keyed out to alleviate canvas buckling. At this time a white substance was seen to be accumulating in the interstices along the figure\u2019s left elbow. In 1968, prior to treatment, the painting was more thoroughly examined and found to be attached to a five-member stretcher with a horizontal crossbar, and to have a discolored natural-resin varnish and an abraded, overpainted surface. The painting was grime cleaned, its surface coatings and retouching were thinned, and a synthetic varnish was applied. The work was treated again in 1972 to address both structural and aesthetic issues. Much of the garment and the fabric being sewn was extremely abraded and still much overpainted. During this treatment, grime and varnish were removed; some retouching was removed (particularly on the figure), while some was left intact; and the work was faced with mulberry-fiber paper and starch paste in preparation for lining. The old stretcher was discarded when the work was wax-resin lined, and the lined painting was tacked to a four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. The work was inpainted and given a synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, inpainting, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe painting is in stable condition, wax-resin lined and planar; the texture of the weave is visually pronounced due to both the artist\u2019s scraping technique and damage from the lining procedure. The canvas along the foldover edges is splitting on both sides but appears to be held in place by the lining at this time. An open tear just inside the right foldover along the chair back is also held by the lining and has associated fill and retouching material. The work has pronounced rebate abrasion around the perimeter from contact with the frame, especially along the sides and bottom edge. There are spots of retouching throughout to address areas of heavier abrasion, and some areas of matte retouching in the figure\u2019s hair on the right. There may also be remnants throughout the painting of preexisting overpaint that was not removed in earlier treatments. The painting has a relatively even, semiglossy synthetic varnish, with light residues of natural-resin varnish in areas of impasto.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French, late-nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel, Louis XVI Revival, gilt architrave frame with cast ribbon-and-stave ornament and beaded fillet sight molding. The frame has oil and water gilding over bole on cast plaster and gesso. The bole color varies throughout: there is red bole on the perimeter molding, cast ribbon-and-stave ornament, and beaded fillet sight molding; and orange bole on the fillet face. The gilding is toned with a casein or gouache raw umber wash with a gray overwash and whitish-gray flecking. At some point in its history, the frame was cleaned, removing most of the original surface and toning and damaging portions of the gilding. The pine molding is mitered and nailed. At some point the original verso was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance, a back frame was added, and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; cove side; fillet face with cast ribbon-and-stave ornament; and beaded fillet sight molding (fig. 24.22).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly acquired from [unknown] by Durand-Ruel, Paris, by Apr. 1912.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

This date takes into account the recollection of Jean Renoir, who recounted in his 1962 biography of his father that this painting was executed while the Renoir family was staying at Magagnosc, near Grasse, in the spring of 1900. See Jean Renoir, Renoir, My Father, trans. Randolph and Dorothy Weaver (Little, Brown, 1962), p. 391. This date also allows for the possibility that the painting was executed the previous year, as was another portrait of Jean (Portrait of Jean Renoir, 1899; Mus\u00e9e Municipal de l\u2019Ev\u00each\u00e9, Limoges [Dauberville 2380]), which is dated 1899 and closely resembles the Art Institute\u2019s painting with regard to Jean\u2019s apparent age. Dauberville refers to the Renoir catalogue raisonn\u00e9: Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vols. 1\u20135 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007\u201314).\n\nJean Renoir, Renoir, My Father, trans.

Jean, the director of such film masterpieces as La grande illusion (1937) and La r\u00e8gle du jeu (1939), would later recall his father\u2019s urging that he become an art potter: \u201cAt Renoir\u2019s wish we did everything by hand.

For a discussion of absorbent grounds, see Anthea Callen, The Techniques of the Impressionists (Chartwell, 1982), p. 109; Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 52\u201356.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this work with the other version: Jean Renoir Sewing (c. 1900; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, Cologne, WRM FC 680). These paintings are the same size, use canvas of the same thread count, appear to have a similar double ground application (see Support and Preparatory Layers), and may originally have had similar five-member stretchers. The Wallraf-Richartz version also displays numerous changes in many of the same areas\u2014specifically the bow, hair, sleeves, hands, chin, and chair\u2014and features scraping (and the strange texture it creates), repainting, and wrinkling of the paint throughout. It shows the figure in a slightly different pose, with his face more downturned and foreshortened, his right arm farther from his body, and his hands closer to his face. See Katja Lewerentz, \u201cBrief Report on Technology and Condition: Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean Renoir Sewing,\u201d in Research Project: Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpressionism (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, 2008), www.museenkoeln.de/ausstellungen/wrm\\_0802\\_impressionismus/abb/gross/38\\_e.pdf.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing primarily red lake, iron oxide brown and yellow, and black. The presence of iron oxide was confirmed with XRF.

This version of Jean Renoir Sewing is a thread-count match, though not a conclusive weave match, with the version in Cologne (Jean Renoir Sewing [c. 1900; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, WRM FC 680]). Interestingly, these paintings are the same size, appear to have a similar double ground application, and may originally have had similar five-member stretchers (see Preparatory Layers and Stretching).

Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler and Marc Vermeulen, \u201c1937\\_1027\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Jan. 5, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis may be an absorbent or semiabsorbent ground offered in the nineteenth century; these grounds are often difficult to distinguish without further analysis and can be glue-based, oil-based, or mixed media. For a discussion of absorbent grounds, see Anthea Callen, The Techniques of the Impressionists (Chartwell, 1982), p. 109; Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 52\u201356.\n\nThe presence of lead and calcium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected magnesium- and aluminum-containing silicates (clays) in the lower layer and complex silicates, silica, and alumina in the upper layer. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler and Marc Vermeulen, \u201c1937\\_1027\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Jan. 5, 2014; Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Gautier, \u201cRenoir\\_1937\\_1027\\_XRFresults,\u201d July 25, 2010; Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012; all on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nPLM analysis in 2012 of 1972 samples indicated the possible trace presence of charcoal in a single sample, perhaps indicating underdrawing, but its location had not been recorded. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this work with the other version: Jean Renoir Sewing (c. 1900; Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, WRM FC 680). These paintings are the same size, use canvas of the same thread count, and appear to have a similar double ground application (see Support and Preparatory Layers). The Cologne version also displays numerous changes in many of the same areas\u2014specifically the bow, hair, sleeves, hands, chin, and chair\u2014and features scraping (and the strange texture it creates), repainting, and wrinkling of the paint throughout. It shows the figure in a slightly different pose, with his face more downturned and foreshortened, and his right arm farther from his body, and his hands closer to his face. See Katja Lewerentz, \u201cBrief Report on Technology and Condition: Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean Renoir Sewing,\u201d in Research Project: Painting Techniques of Impressionism and Postimpressionism (Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud, 2008), www.museenkoeln.de/ausstellungen/wrm\\_0802\\_impressionismus/abb/gross/38\\_e.pdf.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, vermilion (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); cobalt blue, Naples yellow, iron oxide yellow, terre verte (XRF, PLM); bone black (PLM 2012; black noted in PLM 1972); red lake (PLM, possible aluminum substrate identified with SEM/EDX). PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nPLM indicated that there may be two shades of Naples yellow used in this painting, one dark and one light. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPLM indicated the presence of starch associated with red lake scrapings in two separate locations in the child\u2019s garment. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPLM analysis in 2012 of 1972 samples also indicated the possible presence of a trace amount of charcoal at an unconfirmed location. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Dec. 12, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMixtures were determined by a combination of cross-sectional analysis and examination of preexisting pigment scrapings. Pigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, vermilion (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); cobalt blue, Naples yellow, iron oxide yellow (XRF, PLM); bone black (PLM 2012; black noted in PLM 1972); red lake (PLM, aluminum-phosphorus substrate identified with SEM/EDX).
