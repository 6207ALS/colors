    "copy": " Barbara Hepworth's Two Figures represents the artist's fusion of geometry and nature. The teak sculpture is composed of two vertical forms that are situated on a platform and punctuated by white-painted circular or oval concavities. Hepworth expresses the organic qualities inherent in her materials, the smoothness of the teak amplified here by the curving forms, suggesting a play between the inner and outer components of these figures. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
