    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Curator Stephanie D'Alessandro.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Marc Chagall\u2019s an artist who we normally think of with these very beautiful, lyrical, dream-like pictures often with men and women and animals floating in space, very joyful images. However, in the 1930s he began to focus more directly on the political and social situations that were happening in Europe and most particularly on the persecution of the Jews.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: In this painting made in 1938 Chagall focuses on one of the most resonant persecutions in Western culture, the crucifixion of Christ. Radically, he emphasizes Christ\u2019s Jewish identity, linking his suffering with that of contemporary Jewish people. Christ\u2019s loincloth is a Jewish prayer shawl and Biblical patriarchs and a matriarch float above him in place of angels.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: There are a number of smaller scenes in the picture that relate some of the recent events that happened in Europe at about this time including Kristallnacht, which was on the ninth of November in 1938 when in Germany the Jewish synagogues were ransacked and burned. Even though this picture isn\u2019t as colorful as Chagall\u2019s typical images, there\u2019s actually a very beautiful quality of light in this painting. There\u2019s a black and white contrast that Chagall used to evoke a sense of ethereality and spiritualism even in a picture that has such sad imagery.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: In 1937 Chagall wrote an autobiographical poem that reflects many of the images seen in this painting.</p>\n",
