We do not yet fully understand the exact nature of the relationship between Roman imperial financial arrangements and issues that are Greek in language, denomination, and type. The cities were part of the Roman Empire, yet for reasons of local economy, civic pride, and habit, among others, they kept minting their tetradrachms and cistophori.\n\nMarcus Salvius Otho was one of the \u201cfour emperors\u201d of January\u2013April A.D. 69 following the overthrow of Nero. The obverse inscription names Otho autocrator (Latin imperator), kaisar (caesar), and sebastos (augustus). The reverse is a type made popular by the Hellenistic rulers of Egypt and Syria centuries earlier: the eagle of Zeus (usually standing on a thunderbolt, here on a laurel branch signifying victory) and carrying a laurel wreath in its beak. The inscription below the eagle says this coin is \u201cof year 1\u201d of Otho\u2019s reign. It is remarkable that although Otho had never been to the East and ruled for only three months, the city of Antioch managed to get this coin into circulation with a reasonably accurate profile; however, the engravers did not capture Otho\u2019s distinctive close-cropped waves that are so immediately recognizable on his Roman coins and portrait busts (see fig. 42.1 and cat. 43, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Otho).  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The two volumes of Roman Provincial Coinage by Burnett, Amandry, and Ripoll\u00e8s tackle these issues, but the questions are far from resolved.
