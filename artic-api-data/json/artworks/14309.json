    "description": "<p>In this intimately scaled seascape, James McNeill Whistler employed the sparest of compositional elements to evoke a coastal atmosphere. Broad horizontal bands of blues and gray suggest sky, ocean, and sand, with dabs of thin pigment giving economical, yet expressive form to around a dozen figures on the windswept beach. Whistler dedicated much of his artistic practice to capturing the mood and color harmonies of marine scenes. <em>Coast Scene, Bathers</em> was painted en plein air, a practice to which the artist returned in the 1880s. It marked a distinctive shift from his studio-produced <em>Nocturnes</em> of the previous decade.</p>\n",
