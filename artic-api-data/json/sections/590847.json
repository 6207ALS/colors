Robinson, 1943.1174\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent deep-blue glass. Blown in a three-part mold and tooled. Uneven rim, slightly flared and infolded, sits on a free-blown cylindrical neck that spreads out to a tall convex shoulder on an ovoid body. The lower part of the body, similar to the shoulder, is also convex in profile but tapers inward more sharply. The wall bends in and down to form a small, stepped base, slightly concave on the underside. The mold-blown decoration on the shoulder consists of six arches, with an indistinct ovoid or conical element within each.\n\nThe central decoration below is an arcade with columns that support an architrave or horizontal band on which rest the arches of the shoulder. The columns stand on a continuous horizontal baseline. The smooth shaft of the column rests on a double torus base and supports a torus capital below a wide abacus. Between the columns are six vessels: a footed pitcher with one handle on the right; a low-footed bowl with two high handles, filled with large rounded elements, perhaps fruit; a footed, wide-mouth vessel with two vertical handles on the shoulder; what seems to be a tall-footed krater with a tall cylindrical neck, wide mouth, and flared rim, filled with rounded fruit; a second footed pitcher with one handle on the right; and a second footed, wide-mouth vessel with two vertical handles on the shoulder.\n\nThe decoration below the baseline of the main register is a hanging garland that runs from the center of each panel below the vessels to a point under the column. Above the center of each swag hang large dimpled elements, perhaps bunches of grapes alternating with a large ovoid fruit. There is a distinct mold-blown stepped base, slightly concave on the underside, with a three-part mold mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 106.1.\n\nThe piece is intact, with pinprick bubbles and pitting, some scale (inclusions in the glass, usually corrosion product from the metal tools used to stir the batch or form the object), and stone (inclusions of unmelted particles from the batch) in the body, overall dull surface, and patches of iridescence.\n\nThe mold-blown decoration on this bottle is not as sharp as the related opaque white bottle (cat. 107); the description of the decorative elements is based on the clarity of that example.\n\nThe bottles with mold-blown decoration of vessels known in the early Roman period are the most numerous in public and private collections. They are produced in a range of translucent colors such as this one of deep-blue glass, and opaque colors such as the white one in the collection (cat. 107).  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Stern, Roman Mold-Blown Glass, pp. 74\u201378, 113\u201329, nos. 15\u201335, for the discussion of this series (cats. 106\u2013107) with metal vessels depicted, often called the Temple Series in earlier publications.
