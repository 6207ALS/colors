    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, like other artists working in late nineteenth century Paris was fascinated by the theatricality and artificial grace of the ballet. This work is one of this first ever depictions of the stage, made when he was very young. The painting, full of sly humor depicts tutu dancers in the midst of a performance. Their linear formation and repeated pose gives them a decorative if somewhat mechanical air, and their faces, like that of the stagehand in the top left corner are made almost grotesque by the livid yellow glow of the stage lights. Toulouse-Lautrec enlivens the empty space to the right with a witty depiction of the conductor\u2019s large, hairy hands. They seem to mimic the movement of the dancer\u2019s legs and feet. This is one of four ballet scenes Lautrec made as decorations for a countryside inn east of Paris, where he went to visit friends. He originally painted the scene on plaster. To hear about its transfer to canvas in the early twentieth century and its recent conservation by the Art Institute of Chicago, press play.</p>\n",
