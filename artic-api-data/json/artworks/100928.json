    "description": "<p>Early architectural education in the United States followed the model of the Parisian \u00c9cole des Beaux Arts and shared the French school\u2019s focus on draftsmanship and neoclassical styles until well into the 20th century. Paul McCurry was a student at the Armour Institute in Chicago (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) a decade before the school\u2019s transition to a modernist curriculum under the chairmanship of the German \u00e9migr\u00e9 Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Monumental sculpture was an integral part of the architect\u2019s training, as seen in McCurry\u2019s student exercise, a grand, domed memorial arch that was inspired by triumphal arches in Imperial Rome and 19th-century Paris, here removed to a garden setting, with high hedges instead of rows of<br>flanking buildings.</p>\n",
