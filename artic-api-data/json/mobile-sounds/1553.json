    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The English artist John Constable painted this wonderfully fresh view of a village in his native Eastern England in 1836, just a year before his death. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: What you're aware of when you stand in front of this painting is the brush strokes, and you're aware of the incredible textures. For example, the texture of the trees might flow over to describe the people, so that there's this sense of integration of figure to ground. There's a sense of being there, the dewiness of this morning, the wetness, the heaviness of the moisture on the trees.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Scholars still debate whether this freely brushed painting was intended as a preparatory sketch for one of Constable's six foot landscapes, or whether he considered it finished in itself.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: I tend to think it really is finished, because everything is there and it's all so beautifully harmonized. It's also just an incredibly moving painting. It is such a nondescript place and yet somehow he ennobles it with the size of the painting, but also in this incredible interest in the way the atmosphere impacts on this landscape at that time. You just feel what he called he was going to do a sunny morning, an early morning after the rains painting, and that's exactly the feeling you get, and you think how did he translate that into paint.</p>\n",
