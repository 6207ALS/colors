    "description": "<p>Upon settling in Paris in 1930, Victor Brauner established a deep friendship with the artist <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Yves+Tanguy\">Yves Tanguy</a>, who introduced him to the Surrealist circle. Three years later, Brauner joined the group with the support of Tanguy, and his 1934 solo show at the Galerie Pierre, for which Andr\u00e9 Breton wrote the catalogue introduction, solidified his position. Like other Surrealists of the period, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Salvador+Dal%C3%AD\">Salvador Dal\u00ed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?artist_ids=Ren\u00e9+Magritte\">Ren\u00e9 Magritte</a>, Brauner was inspired by dreams, the unconscious, and mysticism, as well as diverse religions and ancient mythologies. Such influences are present in the artist\u2019s <em>Turning Point of Thirst</em>, one of the works included in his 1934 exhibition. Of this work, Brauner wrote that &quot;representing this personage in withered tatters expresses unremitting solitude and should pound the senses.&quot;</p>\n",
