One set was published as an insert for a portfolio of Whistler\u2019s etchings; the other first appeared in the preface to an exhibition catalogue for the artist\u2019s \u201cNotes\u201d\u2014\u201cHarmonies\u201d\u2014\u201cNocturnes.\u201d Although some of Whistler\u2019s statements refer specifically to etching and painting, the theoretical principles underlying his opinions are also relevant to lithography. In the \u201cPropositions\u201d Whistler adopted the same style that he assumed when publicly pronouncing upon art\u2014that of the lofty preacher and prophet, which he used for his \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture of 1885. His style is epigrammatic and often eccentric and autocratic, but this should not detract from the underlying seriousness and importance of Whistler\u2019s theoretical views, for they were the result of his mature thought and practice as an artist.\n\nA number of the statements that make up the \u201cPropositions\u201d point to the importance Whistler attached to the materials, techniques, and processes of his art. One of the artist\u2019s tasks, which according to Whistler could be achieved only through continual \u201cindustry,\u201d was to determine the intrinsic qualities of his materials and to use them as vehicles for his own expression. The essence of his beliefs is contained in the opening statements of the first set of \u201cPropositions\u201d:\n\nI. That in Art, it is criminal to go beyond the means used in its exercise.\n\nII. That the space to be covered should always be in proper relation to the means used for covering it.\n\nHe explained this concept with reference to etching:\n\nIII. That in etching, the means used, or instrument employed, being the finest possible point, the space to be covered should be small in proportion.\n\nIn \u201cPropositions\u2014No. 2\u201d Whistler discussed the consequences of this philosophy with regard to painting:\n\nA picture is finished when all trace of the means used to bring about the end has disappeared. . . Industry in Art is a necessity\u2014not a virtue\u2014and any evidence of the same, in the production, is a blemish, not a quality; a proof not of achievement, but of absolutely insufficient work, for work alone will efface the footsteps of work.\n\nThe work of the master reeks not of the sweat of the brow\u2014suggests no effort\u2014and is finished from its beginning.\n\nIn his striving for an art that \u201csuggests no effort\u201d and gives the impression of simplicity, Whistler was embracing a stylistic ideal that had much in common with the art of Japan. All the hallmarks of Japanese art\u2014concision, economy, and profundity\u2014along with its insistence on technical mastery, are to be found in his mature graphic work and account for its unerring power. At its best, his graphic work is breathtaking in its ability to evoke the essence of a subject. Whether the theme is the Thames at night or early in the morning, a caf\u00e9 scene with a game of cards, a fairground at night, or a young woman\u2019s erotic charms, it is rarely overstated, dramatized, or overworked.\n\nPRINTS AS DRAWINGS. From the time of lithography\u2019s invention in 1798, the medium\u2019s autographic nature was seen as one of its greatest merits over other methods of printing. Except for the reversal of the image, the lithographic print remained virtually identical to the artist\u2019s original drawing on the stone, since no intermediary or interpreter, in the form of a reproductive engraver, came between the work of the artist and the finished print. Comparing lithography with other printing processes, the nineteenth-century critic Frederick Wedmore pointed out the medium\u2019s advantages and the wide range of effects it could achieve, though he then commented pejoratively that lithography was not \u201crichly endowed\u201d with a separate quality of its own, as were etching, mezzotint, and line engraving. The invention and development of specially prepared \u201ctransfer papers\u201d during the course of the nineteenth century emphasized even more the close correspondence between a lithograph (or, more precisely, a transfer lithograph) and an ordinary drawing. A transfer lithograph carried the texture of the transfer paper upon which the drawing was originally executed and not the grain of the lithographic stone. Whistler, who worked primarily on transfer paper, did not try to make a distinction between his black-and-white transfer lithographs and his drawings, but rather drew attention to their similarities in an attempt to establish the artistic worth of transfer lithography in the face of prejudice against the medium from dealers and collectors. He wrote to D. C. Thomson, editor of The Art Journal, in 1894:\n\nWhat do you think of\u201cLa belle Dame Paresseuse\u201d\u2014As a question of quality . . . is it eminently a work of luxury?\u2014the typical drawing of the artist on the beautiful old Dutch paper. . . . And \u201cLa Jolie New Yorkaise\u201c?\u2014does it recall the cheap print of commerce? or does it look as if it came out of a Louis XV portfolio?\n\nOf the first-mentioned lithograph, he wrote to Thomas Way:\n\nBut there is a quality about the chalk on it [the transfer paper] that is simply beautiful!\u2014It looks like a charcoal drawing.\n\nWhistler\u2019s earliest experiments with Thomas Way were drawn with lithographic crayons on grained stones. Unlike a polished, entirely smooth stone, the grained stone has a roughened or toothy appearance. As a result, tiny particles of crayon are deposited on the surface as the artist draws, and lines so formed have a softened, broken quality quite different from the solid lines of an etching or a pen-and-ink drawing. The main ingredients of lithographic crayons were soap and wax, but tallow, shellac, or spermaceti (fatty wax extracted from the oily matter of the sperm whale\u2019s head) were also used, together with a black pigment such as lampblack. The hardness of the crayons depended on their preparation and the proportions of the individual ingredients.\n\nDuring the 1870s and 1880s, Way probably bought his lithographic materials from Zorn, Bahnson, and Co., 9\u201311 Garrick Street, Covent Garden, just a short distance from Wellington Street. Way provided Whistler with a full range of crayons, from the softest, crayon estompe,through the hardest, copal crayon (made with copal gum and shellac). The latter could be sharpened to a fine point and would produce gray tonalities or fine, pencil-like lines, while the medium and softer crayons provided a broader range of rich, dark lines.\n\nWhistler made a disciplined exploration of the effects he could achieve with lithographic crayons on stone in the first state of Reading [fig. 1], drawn in 1879. The most important drawing from this point of view is the largest of the four crayon sketches that make up the group. In the dress of the seated figure, Whistler used parallel groups of lines to render tonal values, the lightest tones being formed from lightly drawn lines well spaced apart, and the darker tones by increasing the pressure on the crayon and bringing the lines closer together. In the parts of this lithograph where he was concerned with creating a subtle range of tones, Whistler restricted himself to using only the medium to hard crayons. Through this exercise he developed a systematically controlled method of drawing that offered him a subtler range of tonal variation than is evident in Study (cat. 3) of 1878.\n\nThe most systematic and technically reliable method of drawing tones by means of lithographic crayon was derived from engraving and etching techniques and invented by the printer Charles Hullmandel. Illustrated in his treatise The Art of Drawing on Stone (London, 1824), Hullmandel\u2019s method involved the systematic use of parallel groups of lines, whereby progressively darker tones were attained by successive cross-hatching [fig. 3]. This produced a range of pearly grays quite distinctive to lithography.\n\nAlthough Whistler never adopted such a prescribed method or rigid execution, he probably knew of Hullmandel\u2019s system. Thomas Way owned a copy of The Art of Drawing on Stone, and Whistler could have observed other artists at work on stones at Wellington Street. In view of the speed with which Whistler learned virtually the entire range of lithographic techniques, Way\u2019s collaboration was probably of paramount importance. Whistler and Way must have discussed tonal methods of drawing, and Way may well have turned to the pages of Hullmandel\u2019s treatise to illustrate how certain effects might be achieved with crayon alone. Such consultation with Way could have focused Whistler\u2019s attention on a structured method of tonal drawing that he could adapt to his own purposes. Whatever the source, beginning in the 1880s, an essential feature of Whistler\u2019s graphic style was his deliberate method of controlling values by modulating the character of the lines and the proximity of parallel groups of lines. Evidence of this change appears in his lithographs of 1879, and his work on these lithographs could certainly have played a part in the development of the elegant tonal component of his later etched work in Venice.\n\nWhistler used this method to render not only general effects of light and atmosphere, but other specific qualities of his subjects as well. An early and somewhat rudimentary application of this style can be seen clearly in the fourth state of Reading [fig. 2]. Here, groups of parallel lines function in a variety of ways: to separate the figure from the background, to suggest the texture of the fur cape over the woman\u2019s shoulders, and to denote the tonality and stretched folds of the skirt. There are numerous examples in Whistler\u2019s later etched and lithographed work where the technique is more refined and expressive. In La Robe rouge (cat. 107), for example, it describes the character of the settee precisely and contrasts it with the shiny quality of the lady\u2019s dress. In The Duet (cat. 104), the wispy parallel strokes of the crayon convey the shadowy recesses and dark corners of a late-nineteenth-century interior. Similar qualities are to be found in many of Whistler\u2019s late lithographs of Paris and Lyme Regis, such as The Fair (cat. 135) and Fifth of November (cat. 133).\n\nA hiatus of eight years separated Whistler\u2019s early lithographs from his later works. When he returned to the medium in 1887, he worked predominantly on grained transfer paper rather than on stone. Such papers seem to have been made independently by lithographers at least since the 1830s, but they were not produced on any kind of commercial basis until the 1850s. Cyrus Mason described how to make a grained transfer paper for crayon drawing in his small treatise on lithography in 1852, and the 1859 edition of Hugh Paton\u2019s treatise, published by Waterlow and Son, included an advertisement for a grained transfer paper that was recommended for sketching from nature, and illustrated its use with a portrait of Alois Senefelder. Also in the 1850s, Joseph Aresti, chromolithographer to the queen, described a paper that simulated the effect of aquatint. The most important commercial development in the history of transfer paper occurred in 1870, when MacLure and MacDonald began to manufacture, under license, the patent brought out by Thomas Nelson for a paper \u201cembossed with a granulated, lined, stippled or otherwise freely marked surface for drawing and sketching on and also for lithographic printing.\u201d Examples of lithographs derived from chalk drawings on grained transfer paper were on display at the International Exhibition of 1871, and in the early 1870s grained transfer papers were advertised by lithographic suppliers throughout the country.\n\nWhistler\u2019s earliest experiments with transfer paper had begun in 1878/79, with Old Battersea Bridge, No. 2 (cat. 13), Gaiety Stage Door (cat.14), Victoria Club (cat. 15), and The Fan (cat. 16). The paper he employed appears to have been of basically the same type that he would use when he returned to lithography in 1887. From 1887 onward Whistler worked with a variety of transfer papers, beginning with the German or Austrian papers known in France as papier viennois and available in three grades: nos. 1, 2, and 3\u2014or fine, medium, and coarse grain, respectively. In 1887 Thomas Way supplied Whistler with the coarse-grained paper and with hard lithographic crayons, which were recommended for use with the transfer paper. Papier viennois and lithographic crayons, like other lithographic materials, were probably bought from Zorn, Bahnson, and Co. in Covent Garden. Whistler quickly made the paper into a sketching book and carried the sharpened crayons around in a small box. He was now able to sketch directly from nature, and this technique conformed to his own artistic precepts: the small pieces of sharply pointed crayon were approximately two inches long and the thickness of a pencil, and the sketchbook was no larger than might be covered by the movement of his wrist and fingers. Whistler\u2019s spontaneous approach to drawing on transfer paper is well documented by his three portraits of Thomas Way. T. R. Way was present in 1896 when Whistler drew these portraits in Way\u2019s office on Wellington Street, and may have drawn his own lithograph of the same subject at this time, but from a slightly different viewpoint [fig. 4]. In 1912 he recalled Whistler\u2019s work that evening:\n\nThree successive drawings did he make; the first, not carried very far, he scribbled over; the second he completed but was not satisfied with, and then he began the third\u2014This drawing proved a most excellent portrait.\n\nThis last attempt, Study No. I: Mr. Thomas Way (cat. 153), is direct and immediate in its appeal, with no sign of uncertainty. Of the other two drawings, one was a false start that Whistler canceled himself (cat. 151), and the other, Study No. 2: Mr. Thomas Way (cat. 152), was completed, but lacked the assurance and conviction of Study No. 1. T. R. Way does not mention, however, the graphite drawing Study: Portrait of Thomas Way [fig. 5], which bears a close resemblance to the lithographs. It was probably executed prior to the drawings on transfer paper, but not necessarily with the intention of making a preliminary sketch for them. Clearly Whistler\u2019s conviction, put forward in his \u201cPropositions,\u201d that evidence of effort in a work of art was a \u201cblemish, not a quality,\u201d and that it betrayed \u201cabsolutely insufficient work,\u201d was made less problematic by the artist\u2019s use of transfer paper. Whistler could work with the knowledge that unsatisfactory drawings could be discarded without great expense or trouble, so that he was not tempted, as he might have been otherwise, to work on them further. Whistler\u2019s persistence in striving toward his own ideal is confirmed by his approach to the 1892 lithographic portrait of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9; the Pennells wrote that numerous drawings were discarded before Whistler was finally satisfied. Stephane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 60) proved to be one of Whistler\u2019s finest and subtlest portraits, exemplifying the artistic methods and values he had stated in his \u201cPropositions.\u201d\n\nWhistler\u2019s early transfer lithographs using the hard crayon and coarse-grained transfer paper are notable for their conspicuous mechanical grain and pale, uniform line, as seen in Chelsea Rags [fig. 6] or Drury Lane Rags (cat. 25), both produced in 1888. In later prints the artist sought to minimize the effect of grain by using the more finely grained transfer papers and drawing with softer crayons that would provide a greater range of tone [see fig. 7 and fig. 8]. The grain is most successfully disguised in two works from 1890, The Winged Hat (cat. 34) and Gants de su\u00e8de (cat. 35). E. Duch\u00e2tel\u2019s 1893 treatise illustrated the effect of drawing with different crayons on papier viennois. Although Duch\u00e2tel\u2019s advice was not available to Whistler in England in 1887, when Thomas Way supplied the artist with hard crayons and coarse-grained paper, the illustrations published in his book provide an excellent account of the effects produced by the various crayons and papers. The French printer suggested the use of a Lemercier no. 1 crayon on the fine-grained paper (no. 1) to create delicate, transparent tones [at left in fig. 9], but recommended the use of softer crayons, Lemercier nos. 2 and 3, on the same paper for stronger effects and tones [at right in fig. 9]. Although he illustrated the use of the above crayons on medium-grained paper (no. 2) [left and right in fig. 10], he considered the grain too large and therefore too noticeable for small drawings; tonal values were also difficult to obtain on this paper. Duch\u00e2tel did not illustrate drawings on the coarse-grained paper (no. 3) since it was rarely used by draftsmen, the grain being too coarse. Nor did he recommend the copal crayon (the hardest crayon) on any of the papers.\n\nWhistler\u2019s concern with \u201cthe means used\u201d in his lithographic works is evident in a letter of August 1894 to Thomas Way, in which he concluded that papier viennois was \u201conly all right for any open and rather slight sketches\u2014as for instance the \u2018Terrace Luxembourg\u2019 or light drapery figures.\u201d A problem arose with this paper when he wished to obtain richer tonal qualities:\n\nNow look at the Blanchiseuse of la Place Dauphine\u2014Well you see that after all, unless it be a fancy of mine, these last proofs on the Dutch paper, are pale in the chiaroscuro\u2014I mean less rich than I would like\u2014It is true I might perhaps have got more tone or depth with a number 3 chalk\u2014or if I had used the stump\u2014But I don\u2019t want the effect of much working\u2014and the more black one puts on, the more grain appears.\n\nTrue to his own principles, Whistler did not wish to force effects his materials could not readily give.\n\nIn an effort to achieve richer tonality and a greater range of expression, Whistler began to experiment with other materials. In September 1893 he had begun to use the stump, or stumping pencil, to apply crayon estompe to transfer paper. The stumping pencil was a drawing tool employed by artists and draftsmen to create soft-edged lines and tonal areas. Judging from the many colored stumping pencils owned by Whistler, he also used the technique on the jewel-like pastels he executed in Paris during this period. Whistler\u2019s use of the stump in lithography was probably inspired by T. R. Way, who by November 1892 had begun experimenting with printing his own stump drawings. The crayon estompe, softer and greasier than other lithographic crayons, was manufactured specifically for this purpose and was not intended to be used on its own. The method, however, was not new. T. R. Way must have informed Whistler about its use early on, since in October 1893 the artist wrote to him: \u201cTo tell me that the stump had existed since the beginning of time in lithography would be no answer.\u201d\n\nThe technique known as the \u201cstump style\u201d had been developed by Charles Hullmandel about 1835 [see fig. 11]. It was used for laying in large areas of tint by means of a piece of \u201cbuff leather glued on to a flat strip of wood,\u201d or \u201cto throw in free and dark touches; producing tints of velvety softness and richness,\u201d in which case a stumping pencil was employed. Stump work lacked the crispness of the crayon line, giving instead the most delicate, or the richest, of soft tonal qualities. Whistler, using the stumping pencil and crayon estompe, echoed Hullmandel\u2019s earlier description of the technique, noting enthusiastically to T. R. Way that it gave \u201ca delightful velvety quality\u201d The technique, as Whistler applied it, is nowhere better exemplified than in The Draped Figure, Seated [fig. 13] and Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73). These works, drawn in 1893, had at once a delicacy, a richness of tone, and a subtlety of texture that were beyond the range of crayon alone. They are the pinnacle of Whistler\u2019s achievements with the German transfer paper.\n\nEven in these, however, the grain is still visible in the darkest areas, and Whistler commented that the paper was unpleasant to work on. The appearance and quality of the paper may be gauged from an examination of the surviving sample books of the various grained transfer papers in use at the beginning of this century. They were all made from thick, strong papers with a heavy layer of composition that was deeply embossed. Charles Harrap wrote that they were made strongly so that the artificial grain would not crush while the drawing was being transferred to the stone under pressure, and he recommended using a good plaster of paris and strong gelatin in the composition to be painted over a collotype or plate paper. Whistler must have found the unyielding graininess of this type of paper particularly unpleasant when compared with the delicate transparent papers he used in 1892 for his portraits of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 59 and cat. 60).\n\nThe emancipation of Whistler\u2019s lithographs from this insistent grain came about when he began to use papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal [see fig. 12]. This kind of transfer paper, obtained from Lemercier in Paris, was unavailable in London, and therefore unfamiliar to Thomas Way. It had in fact been known in France since the 1860s, when it had been used to create facsimiles of artists\u2019 drawings, and had subsequently been taken up by artists such as Edgar Degas, Henri Fantin-Latour, \u00c9douard Manet, Camille Pissarro, and Odilon Redon. In addition to the many lithographs drawn by Alphonse Legros on grained transfer papers, only one, Portrait of M. Champfleury, signed and dated 1875, was drawn on papier autographique, obtained no doubt during one of his visits to Paris after he had settled in London. Papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal was sometimes referred to as papier autographique, papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal transparent, or papier autographique v\u00e9g\u00e9tal transparent, and was described as the most popular and the best transfer paper in the major French treatises that appeared toward the end of the century. Unlike the German paper, it was thin, transparent, and smooth, and was coated with a layer of water-soluble composition containing a mixture of starch, gum, and glue. Whistler found this paper beautiful to draw upon. Without a grained surface, the quality of line was determined solely by the manipulation of the crayon in the artist\u2019s fingers, and Whistler could vary the effect, if he chose, by selecting a soft, hard, textured, or smooth surface as a support for the paper.\n\nIn a sense Whistler was catching up with French lithography. Grained transfer paper, either manufactured in England or imported from Germany, was perhaps the only type of transfer paper available in England for pictorial and illustrative work until the end of the century. French transfer paper, papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, did not feature in Richmond\u2019s The Grammar of Lithography, first published in 1878, but was included in Harrap\u2019s treatise, Transferring, in 1912. Whistler had in fact used this type of paper before, in 1892, when his portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 was transferred and printed in Paris. Considering his enthusiasm for the paper at this time, it is somewhat puzzling that Whistler failed to send T. R. Way the information necessary to enable the printer to process it, and apparently did not pursue its possibilities at Lemercier\u2019s workshop, where Duch\u00e2tel could have given him all the advice he needed.\n\nMost of Whistler\u2019s later lithographs using papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal were direct, simple crayon drawings, without the use of the stump and crayon estompe. They demonstrate a variety and expressive range that go far beyond earlier works on grained paper. Thus Whistler wrote of La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99) that it was \u201csplendid! in its go and brightness!\u201d La Belle Dame paresseuse (cat. 98), he thought, looked \u201cfair and silvery, and beautiful in the quality of blacks! Indeed far away more like the charcoal drawing itself of the painter\u201d He made a comparison between the qualities of some of his recent prints and those of drypoint:\n\nIt is really also quite velvety\u2014like, in effect, the burr in a dry point!\u2014Now even the little Rue de Furstenberg has also this same \u201cfusain\u201d look\u2014and no other paper has ever given it!\n\nWhistler was also pleased with his draftsmanship; he wrote: \u201cThat is a fine drawing, short and sharp\u2014as it ought to be,\u201d and \u201cthe work is simplicity itself\u2014most direct\u2014and with no fumbling and retouching.\u201d These qualities were the prerequisites that, in his eyes, distinguished art of real value.\n\nAlthough Whistler made some beautiful and memorable lithographs in Lyme Regis in late 1895 using the papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal he had obtained in Paris, the failure of the paper to transfer his drawings reliably, possibly due to the damp atmosphere, persuaded him to use a new transfer paper recommended to him by T. R. Way. Although Way did not mention its name or the manufacturer, the paper may well have been one of the popular grained transfer papers manufactured by MacLure and MacDonald. Way wrote that it gave Whistler \u201ccrisp, clear lines, delicate or strong, as he wished,\u201d and \u201cthe velvety texture of the stump\u201d whenever he wanted it. Unlike the earlier papier viennois, it had a fine, irregular grain similar to that of a grained stone. Whistler experimented with this paper in the early months of 1896, using a range of crayons, from hard to soft, and later crayon estompe with the stump. Although this paper lacked the particular advantages of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, Whistler was able to exploit its fine grain to great effect. Among many memorable subjects that included portraits of his wife and friends and views of the Thames, there were two drawings of churches. In St. Annes, Soho (cat. 162), the church tower, the bare branches of the trees, and the group of seated figures were drawn with a fine-pointed crayon to give a thin, sharp line, suggesting the crisp atmosphere of a March day. The fullest expression of the paper is found in St. Giles-in-the-Fields [fig. 14]. Here the stump was used to give both rich, strong effects and the most delicate, soft touches, suggesting light, atmosphere, and a variety of textural qualities.\n\nWhistler\u2019s preoccupation with the refinement of transfer lithography as a means to achieve qualities in lithography that were virtually indistinguishable from the qualities of drawings brought to the fore questions regarding the status of the transfer lithograph. Was it really only a drawing, or was it a lithograph; and if the latter, was it a true lithograph? Did the process of transferring a drawing from the paper to the stone involve any loss of the artist\u2019s work, thus making the transfer lithograph inferior to a lithograph derived from a drawing made on stone? These issues first surfaced in a public forum in 1896, when Joseph Pennell was attacked by Walter Sickert in The Saturday Review for his use of transfer paper. Pennell\u2019s lithographs, recently on show at the Fine Art Society, were not true lithographs, according to Sickert, because they had not been drawn on stone and therefore were of less monetary value. This criticism threatened the value not only of Pennell\u2019s work but also of Whistler\u2019s, and seriously questioned the validity of transfer lithography as an artistic medium. Pennell brought legal action against Sickert and Frank Harris, editor of The Saturday Review, and the case was heard on 5\u20137 April 1897. Pennell was supported by Whistler and a number of other distinguished witnesses, including Alfred Gilbert, R.A.; Sydney Colvin, Keeper of Prints and Drawings at the British Museum; and E. F. Strange of the National Art Gallery. All of these individuals affirmed that a print resulting from the transfer process was not in any way inferior, and no less a lithograph, than a print that had been derived from a drawing made on stone. Judgment was found in favor of Pennell, and it was concluded that \u201ca transfer lithograph does not involve any subtraction from the skill of the artist, or any substitution of mere mechanics for that essential skill,\u201d thus establishing that transfer lithography was not a debased or discredited method.\n\nDespite this decision some adherents to Sickert\u2019s view persisted in proclaiming the virtues of drawing on stone over the use of transfer paper. Bolton Brown, an American artist and fine lithographic printer who was an antagonist of Pennell and a harsh critic of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, took the view that the latter\u2019s transfer lithographs were not lithographs at all, but simply drawings, which might have been executed more effectively had they been created by other means. Brown had an argument in common with reproductive lithographers in France, who fiercely condemned the use of transfer paper and defended the \u201ctrue\u201d lithographic qualities of stone. Paul Maurou, who had founded the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des artistes lithographes fran\u00e7ais in 1884, made the point that he was \u201cnot a member of the jury to judge the value of a drawing. . . . I am there to judge lithographic qualities.\u201d\n\nBrown, quoting from E. R. Pennell, implied that Whistler used lithography merely as a means to multiply his drawings. While it is certainly true that Whistler recognized and exploited the popularity and potential of lithography as a reproductive process, the implication that his preoccupation with the medium was commercial rather than artistic is not borne out by the detailed study of his lithographic activity or the quality of the prints themselves. Walter Sickert, who suffered more than most from Whistler\u2019s cruel and public attack at the time of the trial, was sufficiently gracious to forgive the insults and accept Whistler as \u201cone of the most distinguished pioneers of transfer lithography.\u201d\n\nTHE LITHOTINT MYSTERY. One of the techniques Thomas Way introduced to Whistler in 1878 and which the artist used so effectively in the Thames lithographs has generally been referred to as \u201clithotint.\u201d The name was originally coined by Charles Hullmandel to describe a technique he had invented in 1840. Four years after its invention, the process was hailed by The Art Union as a major breakthrough for artists:\n\nA most valuable process of multiplying their works is now at their command; a process which, previous to its discovery, was longed for and hoped for, as a mighty boon.\n\nIn the previous year, 1843, Hullmandel had referred in the same journal to earlier attempts by the French lithographers Alfred Lemercier, Godefroy Engelmann, and Edmond Tudot to achieve effects similar to those of lithotint, and he published a list of testimonials from eminent people acknowledging the authenticity and unique qualities of his own invention.\n\nIn recent years some writers have examined afresh examples of Hullmandel\u2019s technique, referring back to the inventor\u2019s original specifications and to the examples of the process found in his illustrated notebook. This has revealed that there is considerable uncertainty not only as to the exact nature of the process Hullmandel patented, but also as to whether the lithotint process associated with Thomas Way (and with modern examples of the wash technique) was in fact the same as the lithotint patented by Hullmandel. This latter doubt seems to have existed even in Way\u2019s own time. The Journal of the Society of Arts in February 1891 reported the comments of Sir James D. Linton concerning the lithotint process:\n\nHe [Sir James D. Linton] had been told that the processes under which these works were executed was, to a large extent, a lost art; they were executed in the time of Hullmandel, who was a great inventive genius in the processes of lithography, and, amongst the rest, perfected this; whilst Cattermole, Tayler, and others were executing these works, keeping no notes, he actually lost the art when it had reached its finest point, and it had never been re-discovered in its perfection. Still there was a process of litho-tint existing which was capable of doing a great deal.\n\nLinton was in fact an old friend of Thomas Way, and in his reference to \u201ca process of litho-tint existing,\u201d he had in mind Way\u2019s invention. Since Linton stated that the original technique had been lost and \u201cnever been re-discovered in its perfection,\u201d it seems likely, in view of his close relationship with Way, that this was also Way\u2019s opinion and that Way was conscious that his process was not exactly the same as that devised and practiced by Hullmandel. Although T. R. Way referred to his father\u2019s technique as \u201clithotint,\u201d he did not claim that it was the same as Hullmandel\u2019s method; rather he believed that the latter\u2019s method had died out with its inventor, and mentioned that his father, after years of his own experiments, had found a satisfactory method of wash lithography for himself.\n\nGaro Antreasian, after studying examples of Hullmandel\u2019s lithotint, has reached the following conclusion:\n\nThe extraordinary gradations of wash achieved by this technique have not been exactly duplicated since Hullmandel\u2019s time. Their appearance, somewhat like that of the finest aquatint, provides an infinite range of greys without the granular-particulate patterning and blossomy hard-edge so characteristic of later tusche washes. . . . The visual properties of this process have eluded all who have tried to equal them; its \u201clost\u201d secrets are still to this day one of the most intriguing and challenging mysteries of lithography remaining to be solved.\n\nJohn Sommers, with reference to the above statement, speculated about the process of lithotint that Whistler used in collaboration with Thomas Way:\n\nBy looking at the lithotints themselves, it is possible to speculate that the technique was closely related to aquatint. Using a special mixture of materials which did not interfere with the lithographic image, Way was able to precipitate rosin over the surface of a stone upon which a tusche-wash drawing had been processed and rolled up in ink. The finely dispersed particles of rosin coated both the image and the open stone, which could then be bathed with acidified gum or water to burn the unprotected areas of the drawing in a controlled manner (I would speculate that the image was not in ink but in a special ground invented by Way). After burning, the rosin could be removed and the newly developed image could be stabilized by rolling it up in ink.\n\nAccording to Sommers, this would have retained the appearance of the tusche washes, but would have created in addition the atmospheric appearance found in some of Whistler\u2019s images. Sommers\u2019s speculations have some elements in common, particularly concerning the use of rosin, with the description of lithotint found in Hullmandel\u2019s original patent of 1840. Twyman, however, on examining the patent\u2019s description, has remarked on the misleading and inadequate nature of Hullmandel\u2019s account of the process and his seemingly deliberate intention to keep it a secret.\n\nHullmandel\u2019s patent was based on three claims. The first was for a \u201cnew effect of light and shadow, produced from a drawing so executed on a plate or stone aforesaid, when prepared for printing, by etching after the drawing has been made as aforesaid.\u201d Hullmandel stated that the drawing was made \u201cwith ordinary lithographic ink dissolved in water, and with the use of a brush or a hair pencil, or with the stump, or with any of these styles mixed,\u201d and that it was then \u201cprepared with acid, as is usually done with chalk drawings.\u201d The second claim concerned the preparation of the stone after the drawing had been made and etched \u201cby covering it with a suitable ground [Hullmandel mentioned a solution of resin in a volatile solvent] that will admit by volatilization, and subsequent cracking, or by other removal of portions of the said ground, the action of the acid for the purpose of etching or biting it.\u201d Hullmandel\u2019s description of this process stated that \u201cthe plate or stone is placed in an inclined position, and a solution of resin in a volatile solvent, such as is generally used in aquatinting, is poured over the whole drawing.\u201d The process of drying and cracking that followed left part of the surface exposed while the remaining portion was protected by the hardened rosin. The third claim was for \u201cthe etching or biting of it [the resin ground] as aforesaid, after the drawing has been made for the purpose of obtaining such impression as aforesaid.\u201d Hullmandel stated that the rosin ground was then etched by \u201ca very strong mixture of nitric or muriatic acid . . . and gum water.\u201d After the ground and the drawing were washed off, the plate or stone was ready for printing.\n\nTwyman pointed out that Hullmandel did not make it clear how the different tones in the drawing, made with lithographic ink dissolved in water, were achieved\u2014\u201ceither by varying the resin solution itself or by controlling the strength, extent or length of the etching,\u201d and he concluded:\n\nIn the absence of any real description it must be assumed that the variations of tone obtained in lithotints depended on the strength of the original washes of lithographic ink, and not on the preparation itself.\n\nTwyman noted that since Hullmandel\u2019s day it has been found possible to retain the subtleties of drawings made with different strengths of wash, and he suggested that Hullmandel had also realized this. Twyman conjectured that the application of resin in the drawings \u201cmerely protected the more delicate parts of the drawing from the strong gum-etch,\u201d and consequently did not play a primary role in the formation of the tonal gradations.\n\nIf Twyman is correct, then Hullmandel\u2019s process is not essentially different from the modern so-called lithotint, which relies upon the establishment of the original gradations of the wash drawing for its tonal variations by a process of selective etching. Hullmandel\u2019s lithotints should resemble modern examples, yet this is clearly not the case, as Antreasian has noted. The appearance of modern lithotints is not \u201csomewhat like that of the finest aquatint,\u201d and with water washes, the natural drying process creates concentric rings or arcs of deposit (the \u201cblossomy\u201d quality described by Antreasian) that are preserved in the print after the drawing has been processed. These characteristics seem to set it apart from Hullmandel\u2019s invention.\n\nThe lithotint technique used by Thomas Way is only slightly better understood than that of Hullmandel. Unfortunately, no experimental trial proofs, notes, or detailed accounts of his method have come to light. Yet clearly Way must have undertaken numerous experiments in the preparation and application of washes to the stone and their subsequent processing and printing before he could present it to artists as a viable method of working. According to T. R. Way\u2019s own account, the drawing was made with washes of diluted ink painted on with a brush. Whistler\u2019s recollection of the method of preparing the ink is reminiscent of that described in nineteenth-century and modern treatises. Whistler wrote:\n\nI want you to send the exact formula for the liquid your Father gave me to use for the wash on stone\u2014I mean for painting. I have got the solid ink to grind\u2014(a long cake or stick like Indian Ink)\u2014and I remember you used to heat the saucer \u2014But now what was the liquid? Indeed were there not two? and if so what were they each for?\n\nThe \u201clong cake or stick\u201d was no doubt a piece of \u201cstick tusche,\u201d made (like lithographic crayon) with tallow, wax, soap, and shellac, and dissolved by rubbing it in a saucer of water or other solvent (heating hastens the process) to form the liquid tusche, or lithographic ink. In reply, T. R. Way wrote:\n\nThe liquor with which we prepared the stone before any work is put on, and with which you would dilute your ink forms an integral part of the whole process as we use it.\n\nThe solution or \u201cliquor\u201d thus seems to have been more than just distilled water, and this same substance was probably also used on the stone before the drawing was made (in modern practice the lithographic stone is not normally prepared other than by a graining process whereby the surface of the stone is ground down with a levigator or smaller stone using water and various grades of grit). Regarding the solution required for etching the drawing, Way continued, \u201cthere are three varieties available and their respective use is determined by the actual drawing,\u201d suggesting that the tones were created by the different strengths of wash in the first instance, and that the etching process was to maintain them at their correct values. This interpretation is supported by T. R. Way\u2019s explanation to Whistler on another occasion, when the artist wanted to use lithotint on top of an already existing transfer image. Way wrote concerning the proposed wash drawing:\n\nIt must then be etched or the wash will roll up solid all over. But the etching that will keep the proper gradations in the wash, will quite clear away work that has been transferred, and which has no strength to stand anything but the most tender treatment.\n\nWay\u2019s explanation clearly indicates that the tonal gradations were determined by the washes, and that the purpose of the etches was to maintain them in their original gradations. It may be further concluded that the \u201cthree varieties\u201d of etches referred to their relative strengths. Therefore, the etching process involved the selective etching of the image according to the relative strengths, or grease contents, of the drawing. In these respects Thomas Way\u2019s technique resembles the modern method of forming and treating wash drawings.\n\nLike Hullmandel, Thomas Way was secretive about his process. Although on the one hand T. R. Way offered to send Whistler the information he had requested in his letter, he was at the same time at pains to point out that the etching prescription was \u201cas you know . . . my fathers secret.\u201d Unfortunately, Whistler did not pursue the proposal further, either because he felt that it would be too difficult for him to work with lithotint by himself, or because he did not wish to endanger his good relationship with Way by insisting that the printer reveal the details of the process. Way feared perhaps that Whistler would pass the information on to French lithographers. It is not known, therefore, what the all-important \u201cliquor\u201d was, or what part it played in the preparation of the stone or the preparation of the washes. Unless T. R. Way was deliberately misleading Whistler by inventing a spurious explanation for what was essentially a simple solution, which would presuppose connivance between Thomas Way and his son to deceive Whistler, Way\u2019s reference to a \u201cliquor\u201d suggests that this was a feature of Way\u2019s process that was of sufficient importance to distinguish it from other similar techniques.\n\nThe actual appearance of most of Whistler\u2019s lithotints is somewhat obscured by the fact that they have been subsequently worked on by him, and that they were drawn onto a previously prepared half-tint. The tint is responsible for their overall atmospheric quality, as for example in Early Morning [fig. 20] and The Toilet (cat. 10). It is difficult to know in these cases whether the half-tint affected the normal appearance of the washes as they dried on the stone, making them look more uniform than they might have otherwise. However, there are other examples of Whistler\u2019s use of Way\u2019s lithotint, as in Study [fig. 15], in which no previously applied background tint exists. The character of the lithotint is clearly visible on the dress and covering the space to the right of the dress. Lithotint was also used without a background tint in The Broad Bridge (cat. 11) and The Tall Bridge [fig. 16]. In his own topographical views of London, T. R. Way worked in a wide range of techniques, including lithotint. A good example is his Waterloo Bridge and Shot Towers, from Buckingham Street; a detail of the first state [fig. 17] shows a section of lithotint where the appearance of the wash is much like that of Whistler\u2019s Study [fig. 15].\n\nThese examples of lithotint in Whistler\u2019s and Way\u2019s work may be compared with the example of Hullmandel\u2019s lithotint [fig. 19] and with the modern wash technique [fig. 21]. The differences between these two latter examples are the most obvious. The examples of Thomas Way\u2019s lithotint as used by Whistler [fig. 15, fig. 16, and fig. 20] on the whole resemble that of Hullmandel, except that the areas of tone are not quite as uniform, and there are pronounced dark edges around most washes. In the case of T. R. Way\u2019s lithograph employing lithotint, as already pointed out in the early state of that subject [fig. 17] the detail shows washes that are relatively even in tone, similar to those by Whistler and Hullmandel. However, other areas of the same subject in a later state [fig. 18] show washes with characteristics that are comparable to those of the modern wash technique [fig. 21]. This certainly complicates matters, since it implies that Way may have been using different mixtures of wash, or perhaps processing them in different ways, to achieve these different effects.\n\nIt is impossible to come to firm conclusions about the respective processes without more detailed information. Hullmandel\u2019s method, as described in the patent, remains an enigma; and the only clue that might lead to a better understanding of Thomas Way\u2019s process lies in his son\u2019s reference to the \u201cliquor\u201d that was used to dilute the wash and to prepare the lithographic stone. Did the \u201cliquor\u201d somehow affect the drying characteristics of the wash so that it did not assume what Antreasian called a \u201cgranular-particulate patterning and blossomy hard-edge\u201d? In both Hullmandel\u2019s and Way\u2019s inventions, it seems logical to question the nature of the washes and to suggest that a wash solution might be found which on drying gave the appearance of an aquatint, with an \u201cinfinite range of greys.\u201d It is difficult, in fact, to understand how Hullmandel was able to create evenly toned washes without employing a solution that avoided the drying characteristics mentioned above. Twyman has made the important point that other techniques were used together with lithotint to achieve the final effect in some lithographs printed and published by Hullmandel. However, it is difficult to see any evidence of this in the example illustrated [fig. 19] which looks like a direct and spontaneous drawing with no evidence of subsequent crayon work or scraping to modify the wash.\n\nThe observation by Sommers that Way\u2019s lithotint process was \u201cclosely related to aquatint\u201d may have been partly the result of Hullmandel\u2019s references to rosin and to the association of this with the tonal method known as aquatinting used in metal-plate etching. He may also have been misled by the presence of the half-tint that, according to T. R. Way, was applied to the stone prior to the drawing for Limehouse (cat. 7), Nocturne (cat. 8), Early Morning (cat. 9), and The Toilet (cat. 10); see also The Thames (cat. 161). This half-tint does indeed look somewhat like an aquatint. As far as it is possible to judge from Sommers\u2019s brief comments on Way\u2019s lithotints, it appears that he believed that the tonalities of the washes were preserved and fixed by the normal method of etching the image. The introduction of rosin protected the tusche washes during subsequent etching and created the overall atmosphere he noticed in some Whistler subjects using lithotint. The rosin component of the process, therefore, serves the same purpose as it did for Hullmandel. The atmospheric quality, however, as mentioned above, was achieved by a technique of tinting the stone prior to Whistler making his drawing, and therefore there is no need to postulate a more complicated explanation.\n\nIn conclusion, it would seem that the foregoing discussion confirms Twyman\u2019s earlier speculation concerning Hullmandel\u2019s process, pointing away from the rosin-based component of his specification and focusing attention on the nature of the tusche wash itself as the integral element that determined the unique qualities of the lithotint processes of both Hullmandel and Thomas Way.\n\nEXPERIMENTATION TOWARD PUBLICATION IN 1878. A personal account of an early attempt by Thomas Way to encourage artists to make lithographs with a view to publishing their prints in a folio edition was recorded by his friend Sir James D. Linton at a lecture given at the Society of Arts in February 1891. According to Linton, about twelve or fourteen members of the Hogarth Club met on 15 December 1874 at Way\u2019s house, where he supplied them with stones and gave them some ideas as to how to proceed; the results far exceeded their expectations:\n\nAmong the processes mentioned that evening was one which had always possessed the highest interest to himself, and which he was delighted to see revived, the litho-tint. The idea had been ventilated whether there might be a revival of the processes which should be artistic, and yet be commercially valuable, because, after all, nothing would succeed in publications unless it were commercially successful. The old litho-tint, as he remembered it, seemed to him admirably adapted for the purpose. He had never worked it himself, but, he should say, it was a rapid process, extremely beautiful, and was the direct work of the artist himself.\n\nThe above is a report of a discussion that followed a lecture given by William Simpson entitled \u201cLithography: A Finished Chapter in the History of Illustrative Art.\u201d Simpson lamented the decline of artistic lithography and recommended to his audience that artists should take up working on stone again. He was perhaps unaware that the revival in England, led by Whistler and Thomas Way, was already under way in 1891, and that Linton\u2019s apt reminiscence of an event in 1874 was in fact the recollection of a prophetic moment in the history of lithography in England.\n\nThe meeting of the Hogarth Club members resulted in twelve sketches that were published by Thomas Way in a folio entitled Sketches upon Stone by Members of the Hogarth Club. Three of the artists identified from initialed prints are Charles Green, James Dromgole Linton, and Charles Edward Holloway. Two of the most accomplished crayon drawings are illustrated in fig. 22 and fig. 23.\n\nLinton\u2019s reminiscence linking not only lithotint (which even in 1874 seems to have been something of a mystery), but also \u201cthe processes that should be artistic,\u201d with the idea of publication and commercial success could not have been more significant in view of events that were to take place a few years later. The reference to \u201cprocesses which should be artistic\u201d is an echo from a tradition that had grown up in the first half of the nineteenth century, linking lithography with pictorial art. This gave rise to the invention of methods of working that aimed to provide artists with tonal techniques that more closely approached their work in other media. Linton cited the work of George Cattermole and Frederick Tayler, but he might also have mentioned other British artists such as Louis Haghe, James Duffield Harding, and Joseph Nash, who were major topographical lithographers during the first half of the century. Clearly, by 1874 Thomas Way was already concerned with how an artistic revival might be achieved with a view to both aesthetic and commercial success. In this respect Whistler was perhaps an ideal choice, since he was a painter and printmaker of originality and distinction, with an extraordinary aptitude for self-publicity.\n\nThomas Way and Whistler met in 1877, during a period of economic depression. After several decades of unprecedented investment and growth, the British economy suffered a severe trade depression beginning in 1874, and serious unemployment reached a peak in 1879. Way\u2019s business, which had recently been moved to a new building at 21 Wellington Street, may well have suffered from the economic downturn, and this may have spurred Way on to consider new business opportunities, including the publication of fine-art prints. For Whistler there were compelling financial reasons to pursue printmaking. By late 1877 and during 1878, he was seriously in debt from the expenses of the building of the White House in Chelsea, a project begun in 1877 which ultimately led to his bankruptcy in 1879. Whistler\u2019s plan to publish lithographs in 1878 must be seen as one of several schemes he embarked upon to service his debts; printmaking provided a means of raising money and, eventually, of escaping to Venice in late 1879.\n\nIn the spring of 1878, at the height of his financial difficulties, Whistler and Thomas Way decided to publish by subscription a series of original lithographs called Art Notes. Way may well have had in mind earlier topographical publications in which artists and printers had worked together to develop new lithographic techniques. The example of Hullmandel\u2019s development of lithotint with Harding was particularly relevant to Way, since the latter had recently succeeded in inventing a similar lithotint process. The first two subjects intended for Art Notes, as well as four others drawn for Piccadilly magazine, employed Way\u2019s lithotint. All but one of them were river subjects, a theme that was naturally suited to this technique. Through Way\u2019s lithotint Whistler reinterpreted some of his earlier works: the etching Limehouse [fig. 29] of 1859, the drypoint Battersea: Dawn [fig. 28] of 1875, and the oil paintings Nocturne in Blue and Silver (YMSM 113) [Early Studies and Lithotints, fig. 9] of 1871/72 and Nocturne in Blue and Silver\u2014Battersea Reach (YMSM 152) of 1872/78.\n\nArt Notes was to be published in a limited edition, and circulars were sent, according to T. R. Way, to a long list of possible subscribers. Although the circular has not survived, Way, in order to arouse interest in the serial publication, may have made the point that Whistler, known for his etched views of the Thames, was now turning his attention to lithography and was employing a new lithotint technique invented by Thomas Way. The price of an individual print ranged from five shillings to one guinea, according to whether or not it was mounted. This was a very modest price compared with that of his etchings, and was intended perhaps to encourage subscribers. In the event, however, few collectors or print dealers were interested and only two subjects were completed, Limehouse (cat. 7) and Nocturne (cat. 8). T. R. Way wrote, \u201cAlas! that there was so little encouragement then; had there been more, many like prints would have followed.\u201d\n\nThe intervention of Theodore Watts-Dunton, editor of the newly formed Piccadilly, provided Whistler and Way with another opportunity. Whistler continued to work with lithotint for the next two prints, Early Morning (cat. 9) and The Toilet (cat. 10), which were to be printed in large numbers on an automated press. There is a marked contrast between these subjects and the two that followed them, The Broad Bridge (cat. 11) and The Tall Bridge (cat. 12). The latter two were drawn at the last minute at the behest of the owners of the magazine, and although they employ lithotint, they rely upon a strong crayon drawing for their main effect. Indeed, they were originally drawn as two crayon sketches that Whistler had produced in response to the proprietor\u2019s wishes. Way stated that Whistler only undertook the new drawings for financial reasons and that they were produced as a matter of urgency to meet the magazine\u2019s publication date. Nesta Spink has demonstrated that the close correspondence in size and detail between the sketches and the lithographs indicates that Whistler was able to trace the outline and the main features of the two drawings onto a single stone before he drew the lithographs. According to T. R. Way, both subjects were believed to have been completed when Whistler decided to add the lithotint. The Broad Bridge and The Toilet appeared on the fourth and eleventh of July 1878, respectively. These proved to be the final issues of Piccadilly, and with the magazine\u2019s demise went Whistler\u2019s and Way\u2019s publishing hopes. Nine years elapsed before another, more successful attempt was made to publish these early works.\n\nWhistler\u2019s work on four of the early subjects for publication\u2014Limehouse, Nocturne, Early Morning, and The Toilet\u2014represented an exploration and development of materials in order to find lithographic equivalents for his work in other media. His success was due in large part to the collaboration of Thomas Way, who resurrected materials and methods of working that had been devised in the first half of the nineteenth century to give artists more freedom and a greater range of expression, but which, by 1878, were either neglected or entirely lost. The lithotint or wash method that Thomas Way introduced to Whistler, as noted above, had originated in England as a method that would especially appeal to watercolorists. The use of the half-tint and negative working methods that Whistler also employed under Way\u2019s guidance were related to practices that at one time had been commonly used by topographical lithographic artists in England and France. The method of introducing tints into lithographs was illustrated in Hullmandel\u2019s The Art of Drawing on Stone, and involved the use of an additional stone onto which an overall tone, or tint, was laid; this tint was then selectively scraped away by the artist and the stone printed in registration with the main stone on which the image was drawn. After 1835 the technique was developed into a recognizable style, \u201cthe tint style,\u201d in which the tint stone was sometimes worked positively, by adding drawing, as well as negatively, to provide a far broader range of tones and effects, which contributed a major part to the appearance of the final image. The approach was not unrelated to mani\u00e8re noire, a technique developed in France for painters in oil. The artist Henri de Boug d\u2019Orschwillier applied this method prior to 1833, but Edmond Tudot, with the help of Lemercier, was the artist most responsible for its development. The stone was prepared by completely covering the surface with drawing materials so that, if proofed, it would print up black. The artist then worked in a similar fashion as he would on a tint stone, by selectively removing the dark ground and, if necessary, adding work with crayons, etc. The technique, as described by Tudot, involved the use of special brushes, \u00e9grainoirs, which were designed for specific effects. Well acquainted with the application and function of all these techniques, Thomas Way was able to utilize them in ways best suited to Whistler\u2019s aims.\n\nWay must have been familiar with Whistler\u2019s methods of working, and therefore able to avoid techniques that were tedious and time consuming, such as the systematic layering of crayon work, devised by Hullmandel to build up tonal areas (a method used by topographical lithographers in earlier decades). While such a technique may have suggested stylistic possibilities to Whistler when he came to working in crayon on stone, the method as Hullmandel described it (see above) required a kind of meticulous application that was unsuited to Whistler\u2019s temperament and contrary to his aims. On the other hand, the use of a half-tint was probably suggested to Thomas Way by Whistler\u2019s frequent use of a tinted paper for sketching, where darker and lighter tones were added with black and white chalks [see fig. 24], an obvious parallel with the familiar methods of working on tint stones. For Limehouse, Nocturne, Early Morning, and The Toilet, Way substituted a half-tint stone for the tinted drawing paper and supplied Whistler with lithotint and crayons to work positively and scrapers (or other tools) to work negatively. Unfortunately, neither Thomas Way, who prepared the tints in advance, nor his son indicated the method they used for laying in tints. Possibly it was that described by Richmond, called \u201cstumped in tints,\u201d in which a lithographic stumping crayon was rubbed into the stone with a piece of fine wash leather. The function of the half-tint was to provide a pervasive tone, which could be modified to give an atmosphere and a depth to the drawing, more directly and more convincingly than he would have achieved with crayon alone. The use of a single stone both for the tint and for the main drawing was a condensation of the normal method of working in \u201cthe tint style,\u201d and had advantages over the use of two or more stones in that Whistler did not have to concern himself with the technical problems of registration or with trying to visualize how his work on different stones would combine when printed.\n\nWhistler\u2019s use of lithotint had obvious affinities with the revolutionary technique he had developed for his nocturne paintings. He referred to the liquid oil color he used as a \u201csauce,\u201d and often laid the painting on the floor to prevent the \u201csauce\u201d from running. Lithotint was also appealing for its resemblance to watercolor. Whistler, a marvelous watercolorist who responded to the delicacy and directness of the medium, was no doubt attracted and intrigued by the possibilities of lithotint. The small watercolor Battersea (M 588) [Early Studies and Lithotints, fig. 9] may have been intended as a preliminary sketch for his lithotint Early Morning [fig. 25].\n\nAll Whistler\u2019s lithographs intended for publication in 1878 employed lithotint. He proceeded first by sketching, to a greater or lesser extent, the main features of his design. These were minimal in the case of Early Morning and more detailed for The Toilet. Lithotint was then added using brushes and varying strengths of wash. In Early Morning, for example, light to medium washes were used and these were allowed to blend to some extent, especially in the foreground. Stronger washes were used in Nocturne and particularly in Limehouse [fig. 27]. Details could be rendered with a small brush\u2014as seen, for instance, in the barges at the right-hand side of the river in Early Morning [fig. 20 and fig. 25] and in the reflective surface of the river in Limehouse.\n\nAfter the initial drawing was completed, the whole image was processed and proved by the printer, and the resulting print was used as a guide for Whistler, enabling him to make adjustments to the stone by scraping or adding further washes or crayon work. In Early Morning the reduction of tone of the river was largely achieved by successive, infinitely delicate passages of the scraper across the surface of the stone; in The Toilet the scraping technique included a variety of vigorous and forceful linear erasures that produced strong tonal and textural contrasts. In Limehouse Whistler used a scraper (or other tool) in a variety of ways to bring out the structure, detail, and character of the riverside buildings. The process of proofing and reworking the images was repeated several times before the final state was attained.\n\nThese techniques were not trouble free, as a simple crayon drawing would have been. They called for particular skill and judgment on Whistler\u2019s part in the application of the washes in order to obtain the correct tonal strengths, and, from the printer, special care in the processing and proofing to establish and maintain the values of the drawing. Although Whistler had experimented successfully with lithotint in earlier lithographs\u2014Study: Maud Seated (cat. 5) and Study (cat. 6), both of which were executed in 1878\u2014the lithotint Limehouse was a much more complicated work, for it depended almost entirely upon washes for its complex tonal structure. In this instance the solutions were either too strong or were laid on too heavily, and the subsequent etching process, designed to stabilize the tones, proved insufficient; as a result the printed image was, in T. R. Way\u2019s words, \u201ctoo heavy and flat.\u201d The half-tint Way applied to the stone for Early Morning [fig. 25] and The Toilet [fig. 26] also proved overly strong and gave the impression in the former case of a nocturnal subject; regarding Whistler\u2019s subsequent use of erasure techniques to realize these images, T. R. Way commented that \u201cin these subjects, especially in the Early Morning, he used to all intents and purposes the mani\u00e8re noire.\u201d Limehouse, Early Morning, and The Toilet were not therefore immediate successes.\n\nThe method of arriving at the correct tonal values of Early Morning appears to have been the result not only of Whistler\u2019s work on the stone but also of Way\u2019s re-etching of the drawing. According to T. R. Way, Whistler \u201cscraped away the unnecessary darks and recovered the drawing; after each scraping the subject was further lightened by re-etching until the perfect silvery quality was attained.\u201d If T. R. Way\u2019s account is a correct description and has been correctly interpreted, then the etching of the stone served in this instance not only as a means of stabilizing the drawing (the normal reason for the process) but also as a positive method of further lightening the image. This procedure would not have been carried out by Whistler; it must have been Thomas Way, or a highly trusted employee, who applied the etches\u2014possibly Champagne, the old French printer employed by Thomas Way during this period and known to have worked on Whistler\u2019s lithographs. The etching on the stone in this manner decided the degree of lightening that was to take place in order to give the effect Whistler desired. Further evidence that this method of modifying the tones may have occurred is suggested by the appearance of the sky in Limehouse [fig. 29]. T. R. Way noted that in the first state the sky printed \u201cfar too dark\u201d and that it was lightened by scraping and re-etching. However, the lack of obvious scrape marks and the presence of other unusual features lead to the conclusion that for the second state of this subject the whole area of the sky was reduced in tone by etching rather than overall scraping. This conclusion is supported by the comments of the American artist and lithographic printer Bolton Brown, who observed that in the case of Limehouse and Early Morning the re-etching was \u201csimply dissolving away some of the drawing with acid,\u201d and that \u201cthere is in this operation a large element of chance . . . . the printer mixes and applies the acid, not the artist, so that the results are to be credited to the printer.\u201d\n\nWhistler arrived at a different solution in each of his river subjects. In Limehouse the details and picturesque character of the old buildings were achieved by working back into the lithotint with a scraping tool, working from dark to light to give a rich pattern of textures and tones; in contrast, the brilliant, gleaming surface of the water was created with unmodified washes of lithotint. This atmospheric and evocative image may be compared with the realist portrait of the same subject, Limehouse [fig. 29], etched in 1859. The half-tint upon which Whistler drew his washes for Early Morning [fig. 25] was crucial to the quality of light and atmosphere that he wished to achieve; in the most successful proofs, a critical balance was attained between the residue of the reductive process Whistler employed and the tone of the paper\u2014a few grains of ink less and the bridge vanishes altogether in the early morning mist. The same subject and time of day were rendered as a drypoint in Battersea: Dawn [fig. 28] of 1875. The atmospheric, numinous quality of Whistler\u2019s nocturnes in oil, executed earlier in the decade, was brilliantly achieved in Nocturne (cat. 8). In this subject the lithotint was supplemented by the blue-gray tone of the printing paper that had been selected for the published edition of Notes. The colored paper evoked the river at night and gave the print its overall depth of tonality and color, while the wash drawing provided the details of the subject and the subtle variations of tone. In The Toilet [fig. 26] the half-tint combines with the wash to surround the figure with a natural light and atmosphere, which is a feature of his oil portraits. The combination of wash with vigorous and expressive line and scraping, particularly in the skirt, begins to render the rich, textural quality of the material and to suggest the color and the reflected light that is captured in oil paintings such as Harmony in Flesh Color and Black: Portrait of Mrs. Louise Jopling [fig. 30].\n\nDespite Thomas Way\u2019s attempt to revive the art of lithography and to resurrect painterly techniques, and despite Whistler\u2019s creation of unique and evocative equivalents of his famous nocturnes of the Thames, the attempt to publish these lithographs was premature and must have been considered a failure at the time. Those who were willing to subscribe to his Venice etchings in 1876 were not prepared on the whole to part with their money for a lithographic print in 1878. Nevertheless, two of these subjects, Limehouse and Nocturne, were successfully published in Notes in 1887; later, proofs of Early Morning and The Toilet sold quickly when they were exhibited at Whistler\u2019s 1895\u201396 show of lithographs at the Fine Art Society. These prints represent an important link (albeit a very isolated one) in the history of English lithography between the discoveries and practices of the past and those of the lithographic revival of the 1890s. Whistler\u2019s images were far removed from the brightly colored and highly successful commercial chromolithographs that were executed by the skilled professional lithographic draftsmen of his day, prints that were accepted by the public and by many artists as synonymous with contemporary lithography. Whistler showed that the medium could produce images that were as beautiful and arresting as his work in other media, such as oil painting and etching\u2014the values of which, as vehicles for the expression of the highest art, were not in question. Original etching, already popular with artists, collectors, and connoisseurs, was rapidly shedding its association with commercial reproduction; lithography was to follow two decades later.\n\nTHE LESSONS OF PUBLICATION.The methods by which Whistler achieved the aesthetic qualities of his lithographs in 1878 and his decision to publish some of them in Piccadilly proved problematic for the artist and his printer. This venture had an unfortunate outcome, due largely to the pioneering nature of Whistler\u2019s work and to Thomas Way\u2019s failure to anticipate the effect of printing lithotints on the automated printing press. The four lithographs, Early Morning (cat. 9), The Toilet (cat. 10), The Broad Bridge (cat. 11), and The Tall Bridge (cat. 12), were all drawn, principally or in part, with lithotint, and had been printed in large numbers from the original stones. Although only The Toilet and The Broad Bridge actually appeared in the magazine, all four subjects suffered as a result of the printing method employed; the printing quality gradually deteriorated beyond the point where they might be recovered, and as a consequence, Whistler was left with only a few fine-quality proofs. In 1887, when he wished to publish a folio of his early lithographs entitled Notes, none of these subjects could be included. It is not known if he would have wished to publish Early Morning or either of the bridge subjects as part of Notes, if the option had been available, but he did include two of his early lithotints, Limehouse and Nocturne, both drawn before the Piccadilly publication was considered and both printed in small editions, almost certainly by hand. Hand printing in these cases, however, did not necessarily ensure against deterioration of the image. Limehouse was the worst affected and the edition size was limited to thirty, while some impressions of Nocturne show a slight graininess as a result of printing an edition of one hundred. Regarding the decision to use the automated printing machine for the Piccadilly prints, T. R. Way later commented:\n\nI think that works of this kind should not be attempted, except in such very moderate numbers as will ensure that every proof or print issued will be perfect.\n\nWriting in 1912, Way was referring to techniques of working on stone, such as lithotint, that required constant attention to prevent the image from becoming chemically unstable during the printing process. His comment implies, therefore, that \u201cvery moderate numbers,\u201d which could be subject to individual quality control, required printing with a hand roller by a skilled craftsman. The automatic flat-bed cylinder presses available in the early 1870s, such as the \u201cExpress\u201d machine by Furnival and Company, were designed for rapid mass production and were capable of producing, under steam power, 1,500 copies, and by hand, 1,200 copies per hour. It seems unlikely, therefore, quite apart from the technical and aesthetic considerations, that the use of an automatic machine for printing small editions of fifty or a hundred prints would have been considered practical or economical.\n\nWhen Whistler returned to publishing original lithographs in periodicals in 1890, he was careful to choose only those subjects where the technique permitted such printing without serious deterioration. He also took the precaution of retransferring the image onto another stone or stones, so that if the drawing suffered during the course of printing the large edition on the automated machine, he could still use the original stone for his own proofs. It would appear that Whistler made the mistake in 1878 of not having his own hand-printed edition pulled before those required for Piccadilly. Clearly he and Way did not anticipate the problem, for when The Broad Bridge (cat. 11) was published in the July 4 issue, Whistler also included a notice in the magazine advertising that a limited number of proofs \u201cwill be pulled on Japanese paper, and may be obtained at Piccadilly Office.\u201d The option of transferring an image from the stone upon which it had been drawn to another stone, and retaining the original stone for his own use, was perhaps not available to him, even had he considered it, for it is questionable whether the subtle and delicate work in these subjects could be transferred without a serious loss of quality.\n\nIn the same year that Notes was published, Whistler resumed his work in lithography with drawings made on a mechanically grained transfer paper. As mentioned above, he used German or Austrian paper known in France as papier viennois. In England mechanically grained transfer paper had been manufactured on a commercial scale by MacLure and MacDonald since 1870. In 1873 grained paper by the Mallock Process was advertised for lithographers, in solid sketchbooks measuring 4 1/2\" \u00d7 7\". This process does not appear to have been patented, perhaps because after the appearance of the Nelson patent in 1867 lithographers complained that the manufacture of transfer papers should not be restricted by a patent since the basic methods of preparing them were matters of common practice. In 1872 C. Craigie of Edinburgh supplied chalk drawings on grained transfer paper of architectural views, book illustrations, illustrated music titles, and landscapes, any of which could be sent by post ready for transfer to stone; a similar service was guaranteed by Charles S. MacGregor of Liverpool. Retailers supplied hard lithographic crayons for working on these types of paper, and the designs received by printers and publishers could be transferred to the stone and printed in large editions without the danger of the drawing deteriorating. Whistler briefly experimented with these materials in 1879, producing four lithographs: Old Battersea Bridge, No. 2 (cat. 13), Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14), Victoria Club (cat. 15), and The Fan (cat. 16). In September 1887 Thomas Way supplied Whistler with a block of papier viennois and the recommended hard crayons. Any drawings he produced with these materials would retransfer satisfactorily and would withstand long runs of printing in automated machines if large editions were needed for publication in periodicals.\n\nWhistler availed himself of this facility when the short-lived but \u201clively\u201d periodical, The Whirlwind, appeared in 1890. Whistler published three transfer lithographs, The Winged Hat (cat. 34), The Tyresmith (cat. 36), and Maunders Fish Shop, Chelsea (cat. 37), in The Whirlwind, where they were advertised as \u201cSongs on Stone.\u201d The periodical was a forum for, on the one hand, individual and even reactionary political opinions that included the proclamation of the Jacobite cause and the independence of Scotland, and opposition to women\u2019s suffrage; on the other hand, it was a voice for the artistic views of the London Impressionist painters, who had exhibited at the Goupil Gallery in 1889. The London Impressionists were mostly artists who had studied in Paris, including Theodore Roussel, Walter Sickert, Sydney Starr, and Philip Wilson Steer, all of whom contributed to or were featured in the periodical. They had come to dominate the New English Art Club, having ousted the two other groups of artists, the Glasgow Group and the realist Newlyn School. Walter Sickert, the leader of the group of Impressionists and a close friend of Whistler, contributed a series of articles and drawings called The Whirlwind Diploma Gallery of Modern Painters, which drew attention to individual paintings by Whistler and the younger generation of artists. Contributors like Whistler and Sickert ensured a close link with the influences that informed the work of artists and writers in Paris. Whistler, who was a personal friend of Herbert Vivian, editor of The Whirlwind, believed that the periodical would provide a voice for the views of artists, writers, and poets rather than the opinions of journalists.\n\nThe publication of Whistler\u2019s lithographs attracted some notice in the press. An announcement in The Whirlwind drew attention to a piece that had appeared in the Times, where it was noted that two editions of the October 25 issue of The Whirlwind, in which The Winged Hat appeared, had been sold, and that there was a \u201cvery large demand\u201d for the November 15 issue, which would include Whistler\u2019s lithograph The Tyresmith (cat. 36). Whistler sent copies of the periodical to his friend St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 in Paris, whose sonnet \u201cPas les rafales \u00e0 propos\u201d was published in the November 15 issue with The Tyresmith. Copies of The Whirlwind were requested in early 1891 by the American collector Charles Lang Freer, who had acquired Whistler\u2019s portfolio Notes, published in 1887, and wished to buy proofs of the \u201cSongs on Stone.\u201d During this period Whistler was cultivating his American and European connections. Freer in Detroit and the dealer Edward Kennedy in New York were to become important patrons for his lithographs during the 1890s. In France Whistler\u2019s links with Mallarm\u00e9, Th\u00e9odore Duret (his biographer), and Claude Monet secured a place for his most famous picture, Arrangement in Gray and Black: Portrait of the Painter\u2019s Mother (YMSM 101), at the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, and two months after its acquisition, in January 1892, he was made an Officier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur. The Whirlwind, despite the eccentricity of its editors, helped in the early 1890s to publicize lithography and Whistler\u2019s activity in the medium not only in England but also in America and France, where the revival was taking shape.\n\nThe publication of the \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d in The Whirlwind coincided with Whistler\u2019s first attempt at color lithography with Thomas Way in 1890. The key drawing for Figure Study in Colors (cat. 39) was made on grained transfer paper and transferred to stone. The three subsequent color drawings for this subject were made on a transparent transfer paper, although in two of the colors, the viscosity of the ink creates a grain to some degree. That the grained appearance is due to the pigments\u2019 different properties is clear under magnification. According to T. R. Way, two more colors would have been added, but because Whistler had drawn on the wrong sides of two pieces of transfer paper, those sheets could not be used. In 1892 and 1893, T. R. Way made a number of experimental attempts at reproducing Whistler\u2019s pastels in black and white and in color using grained and smooth transfer papers and printing on toned paper. These may have been undertaken to encourage Whistler to pursue color lithography with the Ways, but they probably also helped Way to solve particular technical problems associated with color printing. This experience was useful later when he developed his own work in color (T. R. Way\u2019s lithographs were mostly topographical views of London and its suburbs), and when he made the lithographic reproductions of Whistler\u2019s pastels that were published in The Studio after the artist\u2019s death. Instead of printing with Way, Whistler preferred the French printer Henry Belfond, in Paris, where he worked on color lithographs beginning in 1891. Altogether, he made six color prints with Belfond before the collaboration broke up in late 1893. These were developed with the intention of producing a set of prints entitled \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d for publication by William Heinemann. Despite considerable effort on Whistler\u2019s part and some promising results, the subjects were never published.\n\nThe publication of original lithographs by a well-known artist was undoubtedly seen by publishers as a way to boost the reputation and circulation of the periodical in which they appeared, but it is doubtful if Whistler, in the 1890s, believed that this would increase the number of people buying his prints. On the contrary, he became more and more convinced that the ordinary public was very reluctant to spend money on art, and he relied on a relatively small clientele of patrons to buy his works. As a great self-publicist, however, he well understood the real importance and advantage that this form of mass production and distribution of his work could have in building his artistic and personal reputation. Transfer lithography enabled Whistler to reproduce his works for mass circulation without affecting the aesthetic quality of his prints.\n\nNevertheless, the dangers of mass production were made clear. An issue of The Whirlwind cost only one penny, meaning that an original lithograph could be bought for that same small sum. Whistler\u2019s lithographs were of no more value, it seemed, than the periodical itself, and so, thoughtlessly, packets of Whistler\u2019s lithographs were once thrown from the office windows on Lord Mayor\u2019s Day as a means of advertising the magazine. Mass production and publication in periodicals fostered the notion of cheapness and threatened to undermine the value of the artist\u2019s work. There was also a real danger of Whistler\u2019s lithographs being mistaken for some form of commercial reproduction rather than original works of art.\n\nThis was particularly the case with the lithographs appearing in The Whirlwind. They were drawn on the medium-grained papier viennois, which gave the prints a mechanical, granular appearance that could be mistaken as evidence of some form of process reproduction. In fact, the appearance of the grain is identical to gelatin reticulation, the fine network of cracks that develops when light-sensitized gelatin is allowed to dry. According to Bamber Gascoigne, \u201cthe reticulation of gelatin . . . became a familiar feature of the printer\u2019s r\u00e9pertoire in the late nineteenth century,\u201d and was used in the process known as \u201cink-photo\u201d reproduction, developed on a commercial basis by Sprague and Co. in the early 1880s. \u201cInk-photo\u201d reproductions exhibit a reticulate grain similar to that in Whistler\u2019s lithographs of this period using papier viennois. Three years earlier the critic for The Magazine of Art, Frederick Wedmore, had mistaken some Whistler lithographs for \u201cdelightful sketches in Indian ink and crayon\u201d that had been \u201creproduced in marvellous facsimile.\u201d Two of these, Victoria Club (cat. 15) and Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14), were transfer lithographs; the reticulate grain is particularly noticeable in the latter subject. In order to avoid a similar mistake, Whistler wrote an explanatory letter, to be inserted in The Whirlwind, to the effect that his lithographs were original prints and not reproductions; this appeared in the November 1 issue. A further note was included a fortnight later emphasizing that the lithographs were original, drawn by the painter on the spot, \u201cfresh from his hand.\u201d The fact that Whistler\u2019s lithographs had been sold for one penny (the price of The Whirlwind) in 1890 was remembered five years later at the time of Whistler\u2019s impending exhibition at the Fine Art Society, and threatened to undermine the high prices he was asking. The reproduction of graphic work by means of photogravure sometimes caused confusion; for example, in 1884 Harry Quilter, the art reviewer for The Spectator, mistook a photogravure reproduction of a pen-and-ink drawing by Samuel Palmer for an original etching by the artist. The importance of establishing authenticity was brought into focus later, in 1891, when Sir Hubert von Herkomer described photogravure reproductions of his own pen drawings, which were published in An Idyl, as original etchings, leading to a strong protest from Joseph Pennell and condemnation from Walter Sickert. The association of Whistler\u2019s prints with mass production and cheapness as a consequence of publication in The Whirlwind was countered by the announcement in later issues that the same prints would be available at five shillings and later at half a guinea.\n\nIn January 1892, when a new periodical, The Albemarle, appeared, Whistler contributed the transfer lithograph Chelsea Rags (cat. 26) to its first issue. The Albemarle, like The Whirlwind, was a short-lived illustrated review, but it was more sober and serious-minded, with political, literary, and artistic content; it attracted some of the young artists and critics who had been associated with The Whirlwind. Henri Fantin-Latour, James Hayllar, Charles Shannon, Walter Sickert, and Philip Wilson Steer contributed original lithographs during the months preceding its demise in September 1892. Art criticism included articles on realism in art and literature as well as studies on Impressionism. A piece by Charles Furse entitled \u201cImpressionism\u2014What It Means\u201d linked Whistler\u2019s work with that of the French artists Degas, Manet, Monet, and Puvis de Chavannes; and in \u201cThe Logic of Painting,\u201d D. S. MacColl also discussed Whistler\u2019s work in relation to Degas and Monet. The publication of The Albemarle coincided with the honors bestowed on Whistler in France and with his retrospective exhibition \u201cNocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces\u201d held at the Goupil Gallery in London in March 1892, the exhibition that finally established his reputation in England.\n\nThe grained transfer paper and the drawing materials Whistler used for the subjects he published in The Albemarle and The Whirlwind permitted good retransferring and large, consistent editioning. A slight loss of delicacy, however, is noticeable in some impressions of these subjects, and small changes are detectable when handprinted and machine-printed examples are placed side by side. In 1890\u201392 Whistler\u2019s choice of subjects for publication in magazines was not yet affected by any technical problems associated with printing; however, as his work in lithography progressed in 1893, problems of this nature did arise.\n\nThe stump drawings of September 1893, as described above, extended the range and quality of Whistler\u2019s lithographic work on transfer paper. When The Art Journal was interested in publishing an original lithograph in 1894, Whistler wanted them to use Conversation under the Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 69), one of a new group of lithographs that he particularly admired and that demonstrated his new work. Unfortunately, when Thomas Way tried to retransfer the image from the original stone, he found that the stump work tended to become darker, and even when proofs were printed by hand, they required careful attention to prevent this from occurring. Such drawings could not, therefore, be used for publication in magazines.\n\nIn view of this difficulty and to avoid any further problems, Whistler deliberately returned to using the hard crayon Thomas Way had originally recommended, and he drew Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d [fig. 31] specifically for The Art Journal. He expected no problems using these well-tried materials, and wrote to T. R. Way on 9 February 1894:\n\nIt ought to come out beautifully\u2014and as there is no stump work in it, it ought to give a good transfer also. . . . The drawing is very light in parts\u2014it [is] done with the German chalk your Father first wished me to use\u2014and so I hope will roll up perfectly not withstanding its lightness.\n\nWhistler was clearly concerned that there should be no technical failure in this, his first lithographic contribution to The Art Journal. Nevertheless, the return to hard crayons for this lithograph was technically and aesthetically a retrograde step. Enthusiastic as he was about the new qualities in his latest work, he was yet unable to use examples of them for publication in England. The technique, although requiring care on the part of Thomas Way, did not present any real difficulty when hand printed; an edition of 107 identical prints of The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72), for example, was printed from the original stone for L\u2019Estampe originale. Whistler continued to use the grained paper and crayons, but remained dissatisfied with the results these materials gave. He wrote to Gleeson White of The Studio in July 1894 that the hard crayon \u201calways remains cold and grey and gave me no chance.\u201d\n\nDespite the disappointment Whistler was still determined to publish his lithographs in periodicals and was anxious to find out the highest prices that the biggest magazines would pay for one of his lithographs. He showed initial interest in the Pall Mall Magazine, which was owned by William Waldorf Astor, the American millionaire, but soon rejected it as being too vulgar and too small in size. Both Gleeson White of The Studio and D. C. Thomson, editor of The Art Journal, were interested in publishing Whistler\u2019s lithographs. In July 1894 he offered each periodical a selection of recent Paris subjects and gave permission for both editors to visit Thomas Way\u2019s office to choose for themselves from the very latest lithographs Way was proofing for him. Whistler showed considerable patience with D. C. Thomson throughout 1894, when the proprietors of The Art Journal continually wavered over which lithograph they should publish; this reflects his desire to have his work appear in The Art Journal and to remain on good terms with one of the most important art dealers in London. At the same time he also encouraged Gleeson White in his endeavors to publish original lithographs, writing that he would willingly let him have a subject \u201cevery now and then,\u201d and suggesting that the periodical should also feature works by other artists, including Royal Academicians such as Edward Burne-Jones, Frederic Leighton, and William Blake Richmond. The publicity value of appearing in either periodical compensated for the relatively small financial renumeration they offered\u2014ten pounds.\n\nThe revival of lithography in France was well under way by 1894. Whistler, as a resident in Paris, understood the importance of the movement, and he had confessed in a letter to T. R. Way in the late summer of 1893 that he could see at last \u201cfortune looming on the horizon!\u2014and I might really be rich!\u201d For this reason the publicity drive was of some importance. The Studio and The Art Journal had a part to play in this; as an artist living in Paris whose most important dealers and collectors were based in London and the United States, it behooved Whistler to keep his name and his lithographic work before the eyes of the informed English-speaking public. Whistler wished to make the most of the opportunity, and the following year, 1894, proved to be his most productive period in Paris. Between the beginning of July and the end of September, he drew thirty or more new subjects that were dispatched to Thomas Way in London for proofing and editioning. Throughout July he continued to use the grained papier viennois, but in August he rediscovered papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, a thin, sensitive transfer paper with no grain. Whistler experimented with papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal during the remaining months of 1894, until he finally produced results that were not only aesthetically satisfying but could also be successfully retransferred to other stones for publication in periodicals. Some of Whistler\u2019s favorite drawings, such as La Robe rouge (cat. 107) and The Smith\u2019s Yard (cat. 124), which appeared in The Studio in November 1895 and February 1897, respectively, showed no deterioration even after large print runs.\n\nWhistler\u2019s decision to continue working on transfer paper in Paris during 1893\u201394 requires some explanation, especially since in October and November 1893 he had expressed a keen interest in working on stone. Two factors at this time seem to have frustrated his efforts. In the first place, although he had worked on color prints during the early 1890s at Belfond\u2019s lithographic establishment on the rue Gaillon (Whistler wrote to T. R. Way that Belfond was the only printer in Paris who worked with \u201cintelligence and feeling\u201d), this association was terminated by Whistler in November 1893 on the grounds that Belfond was untrustworthy. Apart from Belfond, Whistler is known to have had contact with Lemercier\u2019s establishment in November 1892 (in connection with the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait), and later in 1894 when Lemercier supplied him with samples of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. A few of Whistler\u2019s black-and-white lithographs are also known to have been printed in Paris by Belfond, Lemercier, and Clot. It is difficult to understand why Whistler did not use these contacts to establish an ongoing collaboration, and, since French printers were among the best in the world, why he had such a low opinion of them. The problem may have had more to do with Whistler\u2019s personality; he described himself to T. R. Way in 1893 as \u201cmost fastidious and difficult,\u201d and indicated to Edward Kennedy that he had broken with Belfond when he discovered that the French printer had sold a proof that Whistler had given him. Perhaps a greater degree of tolerance was required on Whistler\u2019s part before a productive collaboration could be established. The second factor that restricted Whistler to working on transfer paper with Thomas Way was the impracticality of transporting lithographic stones across the Channel between Paris and London. T. R. Way found that the customs inspectors in London insisted on opening all packages over ten pounds in weight, and Whistler feared that his unprotected drawings would be damaged in transit.\n\nThe critical decision in the late summer of 1893 to employ Thomas Way as his printer determined the degree of Whistler\u2019s technical involvement in lithography. Working in color or in a wide range of techniques was now out of the question, and despite his frequent correspondence with his printers, distance prevented the intimate communication between them that would have quickly resolved many of the problems that arose. Thomas Way had difficulties handling papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal as early as 1892 (partly at least because Whistler had not given him proper instructions about how the paper was to be processed); as a result Whistler was dependent on the mechanically grained transfer paper with which Way was familiar. This imposed an aesthetic limitation on Whistler\u2019s work on transfer paper throughout 1893 and part of 1894, until he and Way finally succeeded in printing from drawings on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal in late August 1894.\n\nNevertheless, transfer lithography served Whistler\u2019s purposes in other respects. This method enabled him to produce a body of lithographic work in circumstances that might otherwise have been less productive, and thereby to play a major role in the lithographic revival. He was able to provide his patrons and dealers with a constant supply of proofs for sale and exhibition in England and America. Edward Kennedy of Hermann Wunderlich and Co., New York, required a comprehensive collection of Whistler\u2019s lithographs for an exhibition that took place in October 18 94. Whistler kept Marcus B. Huish of the Fine Art Society and D. C. Thomson of the Goupil Gallery supplied with his latest prints, and both dealers sought to be the first to exhibit his work in London. By 1895 Whistler had sufficient work to plan a major exhibition of his lithographs at the Fine Art Society.\n\nWhistler\u2019s desire to promote his lithographs without compromising their aesthetic value was safeguarded by making a clear distinction between mass-produced prints and hand-printed proofs. The lithographs sold by Whistler, either through his dealers or privately, were hand printed from the original transferred drawings, whereas those in the periodicals were printed from retransferred images and were, therefore, a further stage removed from the artist\u2019s original drawings. Whistler\u2019s proofs were also approved by the artist, often signed by him, and usually printed on fine-quality expensive Japanese or rare old Dutch paper in small, limited editions. Prints in periodicals, on the other hand, were printed in editions of thousands, on automatic presses, and on paper determined by the publisher, not the artist. They were further distinguished by the periodicals\u2019 own blind stamp or printed legend.\n\nIn September 1894 Whistler drew attention to the fine autographic quality of his latest lithographs and the manner in which they were printed on expensive papers by raising his prices from two and three guineas to three and four guineas each. These prices were two or three times higher than those of some of his contemporaries in France and Britain. Whistler\u2019s business foresight was proved correct, when in September 1893 he confided to T. R. Way that he thought lithography might make him rich. Records of his transactions with Edward Kennedy and the Fine Art Society, for example, indicate a substantial income: Kennedy noted in February 1896 that he had already purchased about \u00a31,000 worth of lithographs and this total was augmented throughout 1896 and 1897; receipts from the Fine Art Society exhibition produced sales of \u00a3626 by February 1896.\n\nLike other forms of printmaking, lithography has a dual nature: a lithograph can be both an original and a multiple. Whistler tried to exploit both these concepts, first in 1878 and later, with considerable success, in the 1890s. In the late 1880s and 1890s, he persistently experimented with a variety of grained and smooth transfer papers, and with crayon estompe and the stumping pencil, in order to broaden the expressive range of his transfer lithographs and thereby establish their aesthetic credentials. They were compared with fine drawings by the masters, printed (like his etchings) by hand on fine-quality papers; and their prices increased in order to combat the impression that lithographs were \u201ccheap \u2018articles\u2019 in the nature of \u2018reproduction\u2019 or popular \u2018process\u2019.\u201d On the other hand, Whistler appears to have been ready to exploit the commercial advantages of lithography as a rapid and inexpensive method of multiplication. Mass production for periodicals that published his work without degrading it (which was not feasible in the case of his etchings) satisfied his desire for publicity but also presented every purchaser of the periodical with an original Whistler lithograph.\n\nIn late September 1894, Whistler expressed what seems to be an ambivalent attitude toward his lithographs appearing in periodicals. He considered the practice to be, on the one hand, somewhat downmarket, but on the other, of some unspecified value. Burns has shown how instrumental Whistler was in the construction of his own public image as a personality and an artist, and how he manipulated the greatly expanded periodical press of the period to achieve recognition and success. The appearance of his lithographs in the early 1890s played a part in that ongoing need for recognition, but they publicized the serious, artistic side of his public image rather than the affected and eccentric aspect that always guaranteed the attention of the press. Both were necessary to maintain the Whistler persona and to establish him in the 1890s as a \u201cliving Old Master.\u201d Another reason for appearing in periodicals was to achieve recognition for the part he was playing in the lithographic revival. The lithographs in The Studio and The Art Journal in 1894 and 1895 appeared with articles that discussed his lithographic work within a technical and historical context, referring to them on several occasions as \u201csongs on stone,\u201d and in one instance recalling those that had appeared in The Whirlwind as the first examples of lithography\u2019s new power to reach the English public. This attention in the English press paved the way for Whistler\u2019s retrospective exhibition of lithographs at the Fine Art Society in 1895\u201396. As a result his reputation was established as a master of lithography and a forerunner of the revival of lithography in England.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See notes 2 and 4.\n\n\u201cPropositions,\u201d reprinted in Gentle Art (1892), pp. 76\u201377; first published as an insert in Whistler\u2019s A Set of Twenty-Six Etchings (London, 1886).\n\nGentle Art (1892), p. 76.\n\n\u201cPropositions\u2014No. 2,\u201d or \u201cA Further Proposition\u201d; Gentle Art (1892), p. 115; originally published as \u201cL\u2019Envoie,\u201d a preface to \u201cNotes\u201d\u2014\u201cHarmonies\u201d\u2014\u201cNocturnes,\u201d exh. cat.

In his development toward a style more concerned with atmosphere, light, and texture than with solid form, Whistler reduced or sometimes replaced linear elements in his drawing, relying instead upon a play of values formed by groups of hatched lines. The resulting linear and tonal elements combined to suggest form rather than state it.

In England, Hullmandel\u2019s long association with Harding resulted in the invention, about 1835, of the \u201cstump style\u201d of drawing, which was exemplified by Harding in Sketches at Home and Abroad ([London], 1836); later Harding used Hullmandel\u2019s lithotint process in The Park and the Forest (London, 1841).

These details suggest that the whole of the drawing, except for the area of the sky, was protected, probably with gum arabic, while the sky was etched and reduced in tone with solutions of acid. The use of etches for the purpose makes it somewhat similar to the modern technique known as the acid-tint, in which the artist works from dark to light, applying acid solutions to a previously prepared solid black ground.

The \u201cImproved Lithographic Printing Machine\u201d by Louis Simon and Son could print five hundred copies per hour by hand, without fatigue. The \u201cExpress\u201d machine by Furnival and Co. was advertised in 1871.

The retransferring process consisted of transferring the image from the original stone onto a fresh sheet of transfer paper, and then transferring this \u201csecond-generation\u201d image to another stone (the original sheet of transfer paper, which bore the artist\u2019s drawing, would have been ruined after the initial transfer).\n\nPiccadilly, no. 10 (4 July 1878), p. 113.

The reticulated gelatin surface, once established, could be \u201ctransferred to a metal surface as an acid resist\u201d and then etched, or an electrotype could be made; either method would provide a surface into which transfer paper could be impressed to give the reticulate grain found in papier viennois.

Way reported on the latter periodical and also on Harper\u2019s New Monthly Magazine in the following December; T. R. Way to Whistler, letter 67. Neither magazine had much interest in fine art, and the page size of both periodicals was rather small, approximately 240 \u00d7 165 mm, too small in Whistler\u2019s opinion; see Whistler to T. R. Way, letter 55.\n\nWhistler offered Gleeson White a number of his recent lithographs, including The Whitesmiths, Impasse des Carm\u00e9lites (cat. 84) and The Terrace, Luxembourg (cat. 82). He wrote, \u201cGo and see other new things that Way is proving for me now\u2014and I give you a fresh chance\u201d; Whistler to White, postmarked 22 July 1894, FGA 185. Whistler offered D. C.

R. Way to Whistler, letter 74. In July 1894 Whistler asked for fifteen guineas when the same periodical wished to publish another of his lithographs; Whistler to Gleeson White, [17 July 1894], The Art Institute of Chicago, Walter Stanton Brewster Collection of Whistleriana.\n\nWhistler to T.

R. Way to Whistler, letter 54. Initially, in November 1893, Whistler engaged the services of William Heinemann, his publisher, to transport a stone from Paris to Way in London; later in the same month, he mentioned having packed a stone in a little box that Andr\u00e9 Marty had taken to London; Whistler to T. R. Way, letter 55, letter 56, and letter 61. Way sent at least one stone packed in a similar way to Whistler in November; Whistler to T. R. Way, letter 58.\n\nSee, for example, Whistler to T. R.

Way, letter 104.\n\nIn 1893 Whistler supplied Edward Kennedy with proofs of his Brittany subjects, color lithographs, nude and draped figures, and Luxembourg Garden subjects. On 8 January 1894 Kennedy proposed an exhibition at Wunderlich\u2019s, New York; Kennedy to Whistler, GUL W1214. Whistler continued to supply sets of prints for sale and for the exhibition, which took place in October 1894; Kennedy to Whistler, 2 and 26 October 1894, GUL W1225, W1226; for further details, see Kennedy-Whistler correspondence at GUL and NYPL.\n\nSee Whistler to Thomson, 30 August 1894, LCPC box 3; Whistler to Ernest Faulkner Brown, [3 September 1894], GUL F214.\n\nThe price of color prints by Toulouse-Lautrec in 1895 seems ridiculously low compared with the black-and-white lithographs of Whistler; the ten subjects that composed Elles were considered highly priced at three hundred francs, and prints of his other color lithographs, printed in small editions, sold for hardly more than twenty francs each; Gotz Adriani, Toulouse-Lautrec: The Complete Graphic Works (London, 1988), p. 11. The lithographs exhibited at the Rembrandt Head Gallery in 1895, in a show composed largely of artists who had taken part in the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d exhibition in Paris, were priced (with only one or two exceptions) between one and two guineas. This included the works of Royal Academicians or Associate Royal Academicians such as L. Alma Tadema, George Clausen, Frank Dicksee, Sir F. Leighton, J. S. Sargent, and G. F. Watts; see Whistler-Way Correspondence, app. V.2.\n\nEdward Kennedy to Whistler, 18 February 1896, GUL W1251; 21 February 1896, GUL W1252; 25 February 1896, GUL W1253; and 24 September 1897, GUL W1275.\n\nLess the Fine Art Society commission, this gave Whistler approximately \u00a3485; see Whistler-Way Correspondence, app. III.3.\n\nWhistler to Edward Kennedy, [April 1896], NYPL II/84.\n\nWhistler to T.
