    "transcript": "<p>Male Voiceover: The Sams, which mended the shattered faces of our war wounded, turns to the gentle task of restoring tranquility to the face and mind of womanhood.  Even the burden of an outsized inheritance need be suffered no longer, now that the healing hand of plastic surgery can bring relief.</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: Because we are consumers of culture, we know how to read \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter,\u201d right.  It\u2019s something that\u2019s &lt;media clip begins&gt; quite familiar to us.</p>\n<p>Male Voiceover: --the same girl, but what a weight off her mind.  Gone is her bridge of sighs and she faces life transformed.</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: There\u2019s a sense that we\u2019ve begun with something that was mechanical, but we\u2019ve got the hand coming back in as well.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator, Caitlin Haskell.<br>&lt;musical background begins&gt;</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: Warhol made four paintings that were looking at women who had undergone certain cosmetic surgeries, and he called them all \u201cBefore and After.\u201d  This one, Number 3, is from 1961.</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: Because I look at paintings all day long and I\u2019m very comfortable with abstract images and I like abstract painting, one of the things that my eye goes to is the fact that these are actually rather nondescript in many ways.  So you\u2019ve got the contrast of white and black and a contour line that\u2019s sort of the profile of this woman\u2019s face, but when you start to see her features, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhy should this small, squiggly line be the articulation of a nostril or a cheek?  How is it that it\u2019s possible for me to read these marks as the face of an individual?\u201d</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: The other thing that it does is speak to sort of issues of beauty and specifically female beauty and personal identity and the ways that those ideas reach, you know, mass culture.</p>\n<p>Caitlin Haskell: \u201cBefore and After,\u201d you know, it\u2019s a convention of advertising.  You\u2019re supposed to really want the prettier, perkier nose on the right, and there\u2019s probably a feeling of, like, \u201cWow,\u201d you know, \u201cLook at what modern technology and medicine can do.\u201d  You know, you have this ability to change your appearance if you want to.  One of the ways that Warhol kind of cements that understanding is by allowing the image to degrade so much.  You know, like, we-- it\u2019s just kind of good, bad, black, white, and, you know, you can have an image that is actually not especially clear and still take away that sort of underlying message because you\u2019re part of our culture.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n",
