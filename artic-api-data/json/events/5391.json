Madsen, Gilda and Henry Buchbinder Associate Curator, Arts of the Americas, highlights women artists whose paintings and sculptures are on view in the galleries, including recently acquired works by Theresa Bernstein, Ellen Emmet Rand, Augusta Savage, and Lilly Martin Spencer.<br><br>These museum acquisitions are part of an ongoing effort to expand narratives, create space for, and revalue female makers in the galleries. Annelise will discuss how, as curator, she endeavors to surface the stories and voices of women and the ways in which their artworks can connect to the present.<br><br><a href=\"https://nmwa.org/support/advocacy/5womenartists/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">#5WomenArtists</a> refers to a social media campaign launched by the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC, in 2016 to raise awareness about gender inequity in museums, the art market, and narratives of art history. Simply put, it issues a challenge: can you name (even) five women artists? Of course, we should be able to name many, many more!</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
