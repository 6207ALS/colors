    "description": "<p>A journalist and photo editor before taking up photography, Inge Morath joined the photographic agency Magnum in 1953. She became known for her insightful portraits as well as photographs made on travels in Italy, Spain, Iran, and Tunisia, which were published in magazines and as books. Like many Magnum members, she also photographed on motion picture sets. She met the playwright and screenwriter Arthur Miller on the set of <em>The Misfits</em> (1961) and\u2014after his divorce from Marilyn Monroe\u2014they married in 1962. This photograph was taken during the filming of Miller\u2019s adapted play <em>A View from the Bridge</em> and features the principal actors in a climactic scene. Hugh Edwards, a noted cinephile, featured a range of Morath\u2019s work (including this print) in a 1964 exhibition and added 20 of her photographs to the collection.</p>\n",
