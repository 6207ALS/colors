The lithograph shows Beatrix Whistler and her sister Ethel Birnie Philip deep in conversation as they stroll through the Whistlers\u2019 lush, late-summer garden at 110, rue du Bac. It was drawn on the smooth, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, mounted on a heavier backing sheet, that Whistler had recently obtained at Lemercier\u2019s lithographic printing shop in Paris. As in his first three successful efforts on the French paper (cat. 97, cat. 98, and cat. 99), Whistler achieved a linear clarity and tonal range that had been difficult to obtain when sketching on the grained German paper that he had used up to this point. This was due, at least in part, to the particular receptivity of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal to the slightest nuances of the artist\u2019s touch.\n\nConfidences in the Garden was one of three images (cat. 98, cat. 99, cat. 100) transferred and printed by the Ways on or around 21 August 1894. The first proofs of the image had already arrived in Paris by August 22, when Whistler sent a letter to T. R. Way proclaiming the lithograph \u201cvery very pretty\u201d (letter 109). By the end of August he had sent an impression (now in Chicago [MWC]) to the Fine Art Society in London; Ernest Faulkner Brown singled out the image, which he liked \u201cvery much,\u201d when he acknowledged receipt of the new lithographs on September 1.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 208 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (315 \u00d7 202 mm), signed.
