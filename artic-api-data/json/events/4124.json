    "description": "<p>Known for its spectacular landscape, Iceland is home to contemporary artists such as Ragnar Kjartansson and the enigmatic Bj\u00f6rk. However, its artistic history is centuries old, from folk carving and weaving to 19th-century painting influenced by the Impressionists and rigorous Modernism. Join us for a quick dip into the island's bracing cultural climate. <br><br>Our speaker Annie Morse is an independent art educator and curator who has worked with the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hyde Park Art Center, Columbia College Chicago, and 3Arts, among many other organizations.</p><p>Following the lunch, we will host a Great Art Giveaway.</p><p><strong>Schedule of the Day:</strong></p><p>10:00 \tRegistration<br>11:00 \tLecture<br>12:00 \tLunch<br><br>Lunch menu options: Meat and spinach manicotti or vegetarian manicotti</p><p><strong>Registration Period: </strong>November 15, 2018\u2013December 2, 2018</p><p>To contact the event planner, please reach out to Gerri Kotyuk at (219) 865-2383.
