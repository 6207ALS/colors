    "description": "<p>According to ancient Egyptian myth, the god Horus was the son of Isis and her brother/husband Osiris, ruler of the underworld. Before Horus was born, Seth, the god of disorder and also Osiris\u2019s brother, murdered the king in a quest for Egypt\u2019s throne\u2014but the gods elevated Horus as heir instead. This statuette shows him wearing the Double Crown, or pschent, which combines the crown of Upper (southern) Egypt with that of Lower (northern) Egypt, signifying Horus\u2019s dominion over the whole realm. Here the young god places his right index finger to his lips in a gesture that ancient Egyptians understood as a sign for childhood. His youthfulness is further underscored by his nakedness and the \u201csidelock of youth,\u201d a single braid on the side of his head, which was a common hairstyle for Egyptian children. In later periods this form of the god was worshiped under the Greek name Harpokrates, which comes from the Egyptian \u201cHor-pa-khered,\u201d meaning \u201cHorus the child.\u201d</p>\n",
