    "description": "<p>The Neoclassicism of the sculptors Harriet Hosmer and Randolph Rogers was replaced in the second half of the 19th century by the more realistic naturalism of French-trained sculptors such as Lorado Taft. An instructor in modeling at the School of the Art Institute for 20 years, Taft created public monuments for Chicago that made the city a center for sculpture. The figures in this work are only partly freed from the marble, a technique that emphasizes the mass and outline of the stone. Explaining <em>The Solitude of the Soul</em>, Taft wrote, \u201cThe thought is the eternally present fact that however closely we may be thrown together by circumstances . . . we are unknown to each other.\u201d</p>\n",
