During its twenty-three-year history, from 1933 to 1956, small, informal classes and the spontaneous continuation of dialogue into the dining room and evening hours redefined boundaries between teacher and student. Black Mountain was a remarkable example of innovative higher education in its time. It didn\u2019t have a traditional grading system\u2014instead students were rigorously examined prior to certification.\n\nThe organization and curriculum of the college were based on John Rice\u2019s educational theories, which combined the liberal arts with the fine arts. It was the sixteen-year presence of Joseph Albers that was central to Black Mountain\u2019s inordinate influence on modern art. Among his students were Robert Rauschenberg and Willem de Kooning. Other distinguished teachers included John Cage and Merce Cunningham. Buckminster Fuller taught engineering and built the first large-scale geodesic dome there with his students.\n\nThe mural \u201cLearning\u201d is one of two created by Jean Charlot in 1944 for the concrete pylons of the Walter Gropius-designed Studies Building. When Black Mountain College closed in 1956, it was sold to Camp Rockmount, a Christian boys\u2019 camp. \u201cLearning\u201d and its sister mural \u201cInspiration\u201d now enoble soccer and weightlifting equipment.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
