A.D. 117: Work created sometime around A.D. 117  \nA.D. 117/38: Work created sometime within or around the period A.D. 117 to 138  \nA.D. 117\u201338: Work begun in A.D. 117 and completed in A.D. 138\n\nAll dimensions are given as height by width by depth unless otherwise specified.\n\nShort citations are used throughout the footnotes to refer to complete citations listed in the Works Cited section of the catalogue. Sources cited in the curatorial portion of each entry are found in the Art Historical Sources, while sources cited in the technical report of each entry are found in the Technical Sources.\n\nArtworks are referred to by italicized titles in cases in which an English-language title has been assigned by the institution that owns the work. Otherwise generic, descriptive titles (not italicized) are used.\n\nInstitutional inventory numbers are provided for comparative artworks wherever possible.\n\nIn the entries on coins, the die axis is expressed using the clock method. The die axis refers to the orientation of the obverse of a coin with respect to its reverse. When the coin is rotated around its vertical axis, the die axis is said to be 12:00 if the design on both sides is right side up, and 6:00 if the design on the reverse is upside down relative to that on the obverse.\n\nThe following standard reference works on ancient coins are cited in this catalogue.\n\nBeckmann  \nMartin Beckmann, Diva Faustina: Coinage and Cult in Rome and the Provinces, Numismatic Studies 26 (American Numismatic Society, 2012).\n\nBMC Greek Antioch  \nWarwick Wroth, Catalogue of the Greek Coins of Galatia, Cappadocia, and Syria, vol. 20 of A Catalogue of the Greek Coins in the British Museum (British Museum, 1899).\n\nBMCRE  \nHarold Mattingly, R.
