    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The installation Coke Head\u2019s Soup is also referred to as Cosmococas 6. We suggest completing this audio stop before entering this multisensory experience.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Helio is in New York in the 1970s. He\u2019s living on 2nd Av., Lower East Side.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: That\u2019s Thomas Valentin, a Brazilian photographer who lived in New York at the time and collaborated with Oiticica for Coke Head\u2019s Soup.</p>\n<p>THOMAS VALENTIN: There was a lot of drunk people, broken bottles on the floor.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: He\u2019s living in the mix of drug dealers, drag queens, and street performers and musicians and underground Rock \u2018n Roll, it was an absolute crucible of experimental life that he finds to be unbelievably exciting, and unbelievably liberating.</p>\n<p>THOMAS VALENTIN: I think that when he moved on to New York, his mind shifted a bit.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Cocaine is incredibly important for Helio Oiticica.</p>\n<p>THOMAS VALENTIN: Cocaine was quite early on in his New York stay.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Helio made no secret of his profound affection for the drug.</p>\n<p>Thomas Valentin: The creation of Cosmococas 6, it was done in September 25th, 1973. In which I was the photographer and H\u00e9lio was the one spilling the cocaine on the back of a Rolling Stone magazine, which at the time was advertising the record Goat\u2019s Head Soup.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The music of the British rock band, The Rolling Stones, was important to Oiticia during these years. The artist often referred to cocaine as \u201ccousin,\u201d a nickname inspired by \u201cSister Morphine,\u201d the Rolling Stones song you\u2019re hearing now.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: This is part of a subculture of recreational drug use that Helio really embraced.</p>\n<p>THOMAS VALENTIN: Altogether there are 26 slides, you show them one after the other, in this case Cosmococas 6 it\u2019s projected against four walls in a room, with a floor which is covered with a soft foam, where people can slightly walk, but mostly you crawl or you dance. H\u00e9lio was very much ahead of his time, I mean to do the types of things that he did were, many of them, unheard of or unseen of.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Helio understood cocaine as an agent of identity, an emblem of place, and a signifier of a certain kind of freedom.</p>\n",
