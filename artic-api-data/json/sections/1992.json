Braude Memorial Collection, 1998.709\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse used multiple sizes of dip pens to achieve variety of line quality in this drawing of his wife. The artist drew the outlines, major contours, and most of the details using a medium-width pen-and-ink line. He used a wider pen to embellish the kimono with dark, densely spaced pen strokes (see fig. 7.1) and to shade beneath the sitter\u2019s chair. He shaded the eyes and nose with the finest lines, using a narrow, pointed pen (see fig. 7.2). Parallel hatching and a running line were used to shade around the figure and help establish her volume in space. The drawing is composed primarily of short pen strokes due to the limited amount of ink a dip pen can hold. Matisse selected a smooth, well-sized, cream-colored paper well suited to pen-and-ink work for this drawing.\n\nBeneath this pen-and-ink drawing there is a faint graphite pencil sketch for a different composition representing only the face of Madame Matisse (see fig. 7.3 and fig. 7.4). This sketch, which fills the entire sheet, represents the sitter\u2019s face in a position identical to that in the final drawing. Matisse abandoned this earlier sketch and drew the current composition directly in pen and ink with no preliminary marks.\n\nThe sheet was trimmed on all sides. The bottom and left edges are trimmed just up to the design without cropping the drawing. It cannot be determined whether the paper was trimmed before or after Matisse executed the work.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 7.5).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 7.6).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink over traces of graphite. The ink has a slight sheen evident in raking light, which indicates the presence of a resinous binder.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, smooth, cream wove paper. It is a stiff, hard-sized paper with a smooth, compact surface that is well suited to drawing with pen. On the recto, a very fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in strong raking light. The sheet is irregularly trimmed; the corners are not square.\n\n49.4 \u00d7 31.2 cm (19 1/8 \u00d7 12 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThere are faint golden stains near the lower right and upper left corners. A faint brown line runs horizontally from the upper right edge; it appears to be a stray mark. There is a stray mark in the neck of the sitter.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Paul Rosenberg (1881\u20131959), Paris, by winter 1929\u20131959.\n\nEstate of Paul Rosenberg, 1959\u2013after June 23, 1964.\n\nSold to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (c. 1921\u2013Jan. 5, 2015), after June 23, 1964\u2013Jan. 11, 1999.\n\nPartially given to the Art Institute of Chicago, Jan. 11, 1999.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Possibly Paris, Chez Paul Rosenberg, Exposition d\u2019\u0153uvres de quelques peintres du XXe si\u00e8cle, May\u2013June 1927, cat. 30, as Femme assise.\n\nNew York, Paul Rosenberg and Company, 19th and 20th Century French Drawings and Watercolors, Feb. 4\u2013Mar. 2, 1963, cat. 19, as Seated Woman in Armchair, 1914.\n\nWellesley [MA] College Art Museum, Two Women Collect, Apr. 2\u201325, 1976, no cat.\n\nWellesley [MA] College Art Museum, One Century: Wellesley Families Collect; An Exhibition Celebrating the Centennial of Wellesley College, Apr. 15\u2013May 30, 1978, cat. 46 (ill.), as Seated Woman, 1906\u201308.\n\nBoston, Institute of Contemporary Art, Twentieth Century Drawings from Massachusetts Collections, July 10\u2013Sept. 2, 1979, exhibition brochure, no cat. no., as Femme Assise avec un Eventail (Madame Matisse), ca. 1906.\n\nBoston, Museum of Fine Arts, The Modern Tradition: Twentieth Century Drawings and Watercolors, Jan. 26\u2013June 22, 1980, no cat.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawn to Form: Modern Drawings from Dorothy Braude Edinburg to the Harry B. and Bessie K.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom in or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nDescriptions of paper thickness and texture follow the standard set forth in Elizabeth Lunning and Roy Perkinson, The Print Council of America Paper Sample Book: A Practical Guide to the Description of Paper (Print Council of America/Sun Hill, 1996).\n\nIlda Fran\u00e7ois, Paul Rosenberg and Company, to James Glisson, email, June 7, 2011; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.
