Widow of the sculptor and architect John Birnie Philip, she and her daughter Rosalind shared a home at 36 Tite Street in Chelsea from 1896 until 1902. This delicate image was probably drawn in March 1896, either during one of Whistler\u2019s visits to the house in Chelsea or when Mrs. Philip came to see her ailing daughter Beatrix at the Savoy Hotel. In handling, as well as in the type of transfer paper the artist employed, this image of Frances Philip relates most closely to the portrait lithograph of William E. Henley (cat. 163), which was transferred to stone by the Ways on 1 April 1896. The fact that Portrait Study: Mrs. Philip was printed by the Way firm also points to a date in the early spring of 1896. By the time of Beatrix Whistler\u2019s death on May 10, the relationship between Whistler and his printers was strained to the limit, and they soon broke off all contact.\n\nOnly one impression of the first state has been located. Although the image itself transferred well, the butterfly over the sitter\u2019s shoulder transferred imperfectly to stone and as a result appears quite faint.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 220 mm), signed.\n\nIt is this state that is illustrated in the Edward Kennedy (1914) and Levy (1975) catalogues. Many delicate additions have been made directly on the stone. Most of the additions serve to model and shade the sitter\u2019s face around her forehead, cheeks, lips, and under her chin (fig. 164a). The changes to her lips in particular result in the alteration of her expression. Several stray hairs have been added to her forehead and a number of random lines appear in the background to the right of her head. Slight additional shading appears on the right portion of her torso. The printed butterfly appears even more faintly in the second state than in the first. It is only in posthumous impressions, which tended to be more heavily inked, that the butterfly can be clearly read.\n\nChicago: MWC, ivory wove proofing paper (285 \u00d7 226 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG, cream Japanese paper (262 \u00d7 195 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another impression is found in Cleveland, CMA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K. Stratis, Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Frances Black was born either in 1825 or 1826.
