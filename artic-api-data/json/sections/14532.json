In 1945, after a friend invited him to a general crafts course taught once a week at Columbia University, Wiener started to make jewelry using a basic set of jewelers\u2019 tools and the heat from the stove in his New York City studio. By 1947 he had opened two shops, one in Midtown Manhattan and another in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he had fallen in love with the bohemian atmosphere and artistic community. In both settings, Wiener drew inspiration for his jewelry designs from the clients and artists who visited his shop, among them such notables as Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Louise Nevelson, Barnett Newman, and Martha Graham. Believing that jewelry could and should employ the visual language of its day, Wiener looked to modern painting and sculpture as a source for his designs, which early on were executed largely in silver due to its durability.\n\nWiener\u2019s biomorphic designs call to mind the spontaneous, free-flowing visual language of the Surrealists, and he cited the influence of Alexander Calder\u2019s wire sculptures and abstract jewelry in his own development of organic forms employing positive and negative space. The Art Institute\u2019s pin explores the relationship between materials and space: an irregular ring of ebony is pierced by three silver wires that retain their cylindrical form in the center but are gently hammered at the ends, conveying a shifting sense of volume and linearity as they splay in different directions. Describing the antecedents of this form in Wiener\u2019s jewelry designs from 1950, Women\u2019s Wear Daily praised his \u201cfreedom of expression . . . characterized in flexibility, mobility of planes and space, and by the way in which solids and space are joined.\u201d Despite the multidimensional qualities of Wiener\u2019s objects, he believed that the primary function of jewelry was to adorn and enhance the human form. As he put it, \u201cAll designs shall lie in the human scale, and shall express the wearer; there is a constant need to test against the human figure; I reject a design in jewelry that I feel is purely sculptural.\u201d Like most of his jewelry, the pin is small\u2014just over two inches long\u2014but makes a strong aesthetic impression when its bold but diminutive contours are worn against the body.\n\nWiener was a vital figure in New York\u2019s studio craft community, and his workshop, which opened as Arts and Ends on 55th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in Manhattan, was described as a \u201cminiature museum for modern jewelry\u201d (see fig. 96.1). He envisioned the space not only as a retail endeavor, but also as a place where the public could learn about modern design. Wiener organized his display into \u201clevels of advancement in design,\u201d from basic square and circular arrangements to increasingly abstract pieces, his theory being that once a \u201cnewcomer\u201d is introduced to the simpler forms, they may then \u201ctake the more highly-evolved creations in . . . stride.\u201d Over the years, Wiener moved his studio to different locations throughout Midtown Manhattan; he continued to work until his death in 1991.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">None\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Mrs. Earle E.
