The image is one of two that the artist drew in early November on a new transfer paper sent to him by T. R. Way. Although the new paper was mailed to Lyme Regis on October 1, Whistler seems to have been too absorbed with his transfer drawings on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal to try it until a full month later, when he drew Fifth of November (cat. 133) and Sunday, Lyme Regis.\n\nThe two drawings were transferred to stone and proved by the Ways on November 19 (app. II.4). On that day the printers mailed proofs to Lyme Regis, with an accompanying letter from T. R. Way noting that \u201con top of the packet is the charming new drawing of a street. I trust you will like it and will give me your judgement on the paper\u201d (letter 159). Whistler was pleased with the two images, but he was disappointed by the overall effect yielded by the new paper. He wrote back to Way on November 22, explaining that \u201cas transfer paper I do not like what I did them upon much, and as a result I don\u2019t think the street scene (\u2018Sunday\u2019) to compare with la Rue du Furstenberg (cat. 97) for a moment in crispness and brilliancy. Moreover, do what I will, when it comes to colour, the lines are shockingly lithographic\u201d (letter 162A). Way, however, clearly thought the \u201clithographic\u201d character imparted by the new paper was its primary asset. He responded, \u201cI am glad you found the texture of our paper [gave] a lithographic character to your line. Anyone would be bold who should say these last two drawings were not made direct onto stone\u201d (letter 162).\n\nSunday, Lyme Regis was one of thirteen stones that were printed in editions of twenty impressions in late November for the exhibition at the Fine Art Society (app. III.1). Either Whistler or the Ways made the selection in consultation with the gallery, and these were clearly lithographs that were expected to sell well. Six impressions of the Lyme Regis street scene were purchased by dealers and private collectors during the course of the exhibition, which opened in mid-December 1895 (app. III.4).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream wove paper (240 \u00d7 209 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid paper (248 \u00d7 182 mm), signed.
