    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator, Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: This large basin was actually made to hold water which would be used to cool wine for a feast, and it would probably be part of a whole service of painted ceramics called maiolica, which were much desired by rich households, by princes, by merchants, shipped around Europe for those kinds of clients.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator, Rebecca Long.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: There\u2019s a real playfulness about the imagery in this case that relates specifically to the function of the vessel as a container, and so there\u2019s a naval battle on the inside.  The idea would be that this would\u2019ve sat on the floor, so you really would be looking down on it and getting that parallel between the imagery and the function of the object.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: And it would sit on the floor probably by a sort of a staging station where the servants would pour the wine out, get things ready to bring to the guests at table as part of the ritual of the feast.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: Sort of as a parallel track of luxury tableware for feasting in the period, if you look at the case behind you in the gallery, you\u2019ll see examples of Venetian glass, which are not figurated, which don\u2019t have a narrative, but the fineness of the technique and material and process are what brings the luxury aspect to those objects.</p>\n",
