    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: As you look at this painting by artist Vincent van Gogh notice there are no shadows cast by the chairs, bed and table. Without the shadows the furniture seems to hover and push towards your eyes rather than be planted firmly on the floor. To this bright shadow-less scene Van Gogh applies pure colors surrounded by thick contour. These techniques used to flatten the perspective of this bedroom are based on lessons he learned from his own collection of Japanese woodblock or ukiyo-e prints. Gloria Groom, curator of European painting.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: But what he loved about the culture and art of Japan was its simplicity. It\u2019s subjects from humble life. He\u2019s really thinking about what the Japanese did in their art and, yet, he\u2019s making it his own.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This colorful view on van Gogh\u2019s bedroom in the French town of Arles represents a uniquely happy period of his life. He anticipated the arrival of his friend the artist Paul Gauguin and hoped the two would share what he called the yellow house. Although, they would eventually quarrel and separate this painting with its bold flat colors found in Japanese prints captures the artist\u2019s brighter expectations.</p>\n",
