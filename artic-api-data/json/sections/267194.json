The compositional device used here is one that he had developed while working in Venice: one principal area of interest is treated in detail, and surrounding areas are depicted in a more cursory style. Little Court, Cloth Fair has more contrast than Whistler\u2019s other lithographs of St. Bartholomew sites (cat. 20 and cat. 21), suggesting that the artist may have been working with softer crayons. A similar approach to scale, composition, and subject matter is found in Fleur de Lys Passage (K 289), one of several etchings Whistler made in this neighborhood at about the same time.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (322 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 202 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory wove paper (318 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; SC, ivory wove paper (317 \u00d7 202 mm).
