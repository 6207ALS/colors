    "copy": " One of Brazil\u2019s best-known contemporary artists, Lygia Pape (1927\u20132004) was a founding member of the Neo-Concrete movement in the late 1950s along with artists such as Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica. Pape explored new visual languages in painting, performance, printmaking, and sculpture, and her work\u2014much of it based in geometry\u2014 invited viewers to participate in the existential, sensorial, and psychological experience of her art. Presenting the first in-depth treatment of the experimental woodblock prints Pape made between 1952 and 1960, this volume examines the foundational role these works played in the rest of her career, foreshadowing her philosophy of \u201cmagnetized space.\u201d Composed of overlapping geometric and linear elements that at times suggest atomic particles or slides of microscopic specimens, Pape\u2019s prints display an extraordinary depth accentuated by her use of incredibly thin, translucent Japanese papers. The artist applied the title Tecelares to these works decades after their creation. Loosely translated as \u201cweavings,\u201d the term captures Pape\u2019s uniquely handmade approach to printmaking as well as her interest in indigenous Brazilian culture. Lavishly illustrated, this study is filled with revealing insights into how the artist\u2019s printmaking aesthetic, materials, and process embody her core ideas about art.
