    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Martha Wolff:</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: Paulus Potter's &quot;Two Cows and a Young Bull&quot; is really a tour de force of realism by a very young painter who specialized in the treatment of animals, and &lt;break in recording&gt; the Dutch Republic in the early 17th century was remarkably urban and was very rich from trade.  There was certainly a fascination with the land, a romance of land ownership and the country life, and probably this sort of subject fits in with that feeling.  The treatment of the two cows and the young bull is also almost a witty recreation of human interactions and emotions, as one thinks of the eager young bull staring out with bulging eyes towards the viewer and almost an animated expression, protective of these two very vividly observed cows that are relaxing in front of him; and one sees the realism of Paulus Potter's brushstrokes wonderfully preserved in the treatment of all the textures of the animals' hide, of the muddy ground, the distant pastureland, and the beautiful Dutch sky with the changeability of the clouds and the weather and the moist air of the Dutch landscape.</p>\n",
