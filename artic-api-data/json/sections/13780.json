By this time Albright had established a reputation as a provocateur famous for his richly detailed paintings of morbid subjects: decaying bodies, rotting doors, and funereal still lifes. He was in the middle of working on a composition called The Window, which he ultimately titled Poor Room\u2014There Is No Time, No End, No Today, No Yesterday, No Tomorrow, Only the Forever, and Forever, and Forever without End (cat. 17). This complex allegory took more than twenty years to complete. Albright had concocted an elaborate setup in his studio: brick facade, grimy window, prop hand, dusty bottles, baby\u2019s shoe, whiskey flask, wasp nest, corset, and mirror (see fig. 1). \u201cI have never seen anything as frightening,\u201d Dubuffet recalled.\n\nAlbright\u2019s paintings, Dubuffet concluded, were as unsettling as his studio. \u201cThere are few pictures as alarming as those of Albright,\u201d said Dubuffet, himself no stranger to art that shocked and dismayed. Albright, according to Dubuffet, \u201cswept away, in the marvelously proliferating universe, in the pullulating anarchy . . . all the criteria of order and the archetypes of our former ideas of beauty.\u201d Rejecting beauty as an ideal, Albright harnessed ugliness as a transgressive force capable of undermining the values of Western civilization\u2014an agenda that appealed to Dubuffet. On the same trip Dubuffet delivered a provocative lecture at the Arts Club of Chicago, \u201cAnticultural Positions,\u201d in which he announced, \u201cI have the impression that a complete liquidation of all the ways of thinking whose sum constituted what has been called humanism and has been fundamental for our culture since the Renaissance, is now taking place, or, at least, going to take place soon.\u201d\n\nPerhaps with Albright in mind, Dubuffet launched a withering and iconoclastic critique of \u201cthe idea of beauty,\u201d as he put it, which \u201cis one of the things our [Western] culture prizes most and it is customary to consider this belief in beauty and the respect for this beauty as the ultimate justification of Western civilization.\u201d In his lecture Dubuffet decried \u201cbeauty\u201d as an essentially violent and exclusionary concept that categorized people, places, and things as either beautiful or ugly. He considered this notion of beauty to be \u201cstifling and revolting\u201d and instead championed what he termed art brut (\u201craw art\u201d), now referred to as Outsider art\u2014art by children, self-taught artists, prisoners, and the mentally ill. This constituted a rejection of established canons and institutions of culture. His own work, with its thick, heavily accreted surface texture and figures rendered in simple, childlike outlines (see fig. 2), bears little superficial resemblance to Albright\u2019s meticulously crafted canvases beyond the depiction of subjects conventionally deemed \u201cugly.\u201d But Dubuffet recognized in Albright a kindred spirit: an artist who undermined the most cherished beliefs and values of Western culture. He grasped immediately the threat these gruesome creations posed to established canons of order, reason, and beauty. He deemed Albright\u2019s work \u201cdangerously inflammable\u201d and wondered, \u201cMust these paintings be burned?\u201d\n\nWhen Dubuffet visited Albright in 1951, the Chicago-based painter had already achieved his greatest professional success with Picture of Dorian Gray (cat. 18), which had been commissioned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the 1945 film adaptation of Oscar Wilde\u2019s 1891 novel of the same title. The young and handsome aristocrat Dorian Gray, upon seeing his completed full-length portrait, experiences a \u201csense of his own beauty\u201d as a Narcissus-like revelation. \u201cHow sad it is!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cI shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young.\u201d Dorian\u2019s lament turns into a prayer: \u201cIf it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old! For that I would give everything . . . I would give my soul for that!\u201d The Faustian pact is made; Dorian grows increasingly corrupt and soulless, leading a life of debauchery while maintaining his youthful beauty. Meanwhile, the portrait, hidden in his attic nursery, reveals the ravages of sin and old age.\n\nGiven the opportunity to paint an aged and decrepit Dorian, \u201cwithered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage,\u201d as Wilde wrote, Albright pushed the limits of good taste. The eyes bulge maniacally, as if Dorian is in the throes of some demonic vision. Sores and pustules fester on his skin, the lips are cracked and blistered, the cheeks are hollow and sunken. Nor did Albright limit the effects to his subject: the entire composition seems to swirl and melt with hallucinatory intensity, suggesting that the phenomenal world had been infected by Dorian\u2019s delirium. The movie version, predominantly filmed in black-and-white, flashes suddenly into eye-popping Technicolor the moment the painting appears onscreen (fig. 3).\n\nA publicity photograph installed for the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s annual American exhibition in 1945 (fig. 4) captures the sense of revulsion Albright\u2019s works inspired. Standing before the painting, one young woman buries her head in her hand, and another recoils in horror. Their two companions, by comparison, appear compelled by the painting, and their attitude recalls Dorian\u2019s own perverse fascination with his aging portrait. \u201cHe would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead, or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth.\u201d\n\nCritics had noted this curious ability of Albright\u2019s paintings to simultaneously attract and repulse since he began exhibiting in the 1920s. In 1931 a critic discerned a structuring tension between revulsion and fascination: \u201cThere is a frightful fascination about [Albright\u2019s paintings] that makes the beholder return to the scene of the torture.\u201d Albright might paint less than a square inch of canvas in a day; it could take him up to ten or fifteen years to complete a single work. This technique, which resulted in detailed, textured surfaces, seduces the viewer however repellent the subject matter. As a critic for the Christian Science Monitor put it: \u201cWith a technical equipment second to none, a way of working that is so distinctly his own that no one can successfully own it, a rare feeling for modeling and textures, [Albright] has produced paintings that are positively loathsome in the feeling of horror that it gives the spectator.\u201d\n\nDubuffet, on his visit to Albright\u2019s studio, also noted this tension: \u201cThe hostile is manifest in [Albright\u2019s paintings] . . . which despite that appears to us suddenly, endowed with a fascinating irresistible attraction.\u201d This sense of hostility provoked visceral, even violent, responses. Protesters managed to censor the display of Woman (fig. 5) at a 1928 contemporary art exhibition in Toledo, Ohio. Albright seemed to take the situation philosophically, wondering why the citizens of Toledo found fault with his model\u2019s peculiar and unique beauty.\n\nThe same year Albright\u2019s The Lineman (cat. 3) met with outrage when it was reproduced on the cover of industry journal Electric Light and Power (fig. 6, left). In this portrait of his neighbor Arthur Stanford, the figure\u2019s baggy eyes, lined face, wilting shoulders, and ill-fitting clothes\u2014rendered in an earthy realism reminiscent of the styles of \u00c9douard Manet and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez\u2014all suggest a tired, downtrodden worker on the eve of the Great Depression. In a letter to the editor, a power engineer from Massachusetts waxed indignant: \u201cFrankly, all I can see in Mr. Albright\u2019s picture is a down-and-out tramp who has stolen a lineman\u2019s belt and pole strap.\u201d The magazine issued a mea culpa by featuring a \u201cmodern lineman\u201d on the August cover (fig. 6, right)\u2014a strapping, square-shouldered, square-jawed specimen\u2014consigning Albright\u2019s figure to the dustbin of history.\n\nArline Stanford, the lineman\u2019s wife, had posed for Flesh (Smaller Than Tears Are the Little Blue Flowers) (cat. 5), a manifesto-like painting whose title, \u201cFlesh,\u201d announces the theme and subject matter that would preoccupy Albright throughout his career: the vagaries of age, the vulnerabilities of the body, the gruesome particulars of flesh. In the painting, the woman\u2019s pockmarked face, concave cheeks, and heavy-lidded eyes belie her fashionably bobbed haircut, while the forget-me-nots scattered at the bottom of a bowl symbolize the traditional vanitas themes of faded youth and the transience of life.\n\nFlesh proved a prelude to an early masterpiece, Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida (cat. 7), which was exhibited in 1931 at the Art Institute of Chicago and received a gold medal from the Chicago Society of Artists. The setup is theatrical: Ida sits cross-legged in a wicker chair in a darkened room\u2014more of a stage set or dais\u2014gazing at herself in a handheld mirror while powdering her chest. The floor tilts precipitously, and the red woven carpet fades into the darkness behind her. Ida appears spotlit, faintly glowing, an effect Albright deliberately achieved in his studio by matting the walls black and employing a single skylight. Ida is a modern woman, like the model for Flesh, sporting a fashionable haircut, rouge, lipstick, and high heels. The paraphernalia of independence lie scattered on the vanity table: a crumpled dollar bill, a burning cigarette, face powder, a comb, and the ubiquitous fading flowers. These markers of youthful amusement contrast starkly with Ida\u2019s pallid features and puckered legs. One critic saw a \u201cwoman with flesh the color of a corpse drowned six weeks,\u201d and another called her a figure \u201cleathery, knotted, gnarled, down with dropsy.\u201d They would have been shocked to discover that the model for the portrait, Ida Rogers, was nineteen years old.\n\nDaniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute from 1938 to 1958 and a perceptive critic of Albright, noted that flesh itself was the subject \u201cthat Albright analyzes\u2014a rabid, delicate autopsy on skin and tissue. This corruptible he paints with amazing relish; it loosens, rots and decays yet holds a strange fascination.\u201d Rich identified the \u201cstrange fascination\u201d of this \u201ccorruptible\u201d subject matter. Ugliness was Albright\u2019s m\u00e9tier: he positively reveled in every wrinkle, blemish, blotch, fold, and furrow of his cruelly exposed and harshly lit subjects. Ugliness, therefore, was not a strategy simply to inspire shock and attract controversy; ugliness posed a philosophical paradox at the heart of the aesthetic experience: If aesthetics is the science or study of beauty, is \u201caesthetics of ugliness\u201d a contradiction in terms? And to what purpose could ugliness be used to aesthetic effect and as a philosophical statement?\n\nThe German philosopher Karl Rosenkranz first gave these questions systematic treatment in 1853 in Aesthetics of Ugliness. Rosenkranz drew on a range of literary and artistic sources\u2014including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, J. J. Grandville, Antoine-Jean Gros, E. T. A. Hoffmann, William Hogarth, and William Shakespeare\u2014as he expounded upon his fundamental point: \u201cIf the idea of beauty is to be considered, an investigation of ugliness is inseparable from it. The concept of ugliness, of negative beauty, thus is a part of aesthetics.\u201d Ugliness, Rosenkranz wrote, is the \u201cdanger that threatens [beauty] from inside itself, the contradiction that it poses to itself through its essence.\u201d Albright figured this in Into the World Came a Soul Called Ida by choosing as his model a young woman and aging her artificially: he wanted to capture beauty and decay, youth and old age, in one composite portrait\u2014beauty threatening itself from the inside. The same holds true for Dorian Gray: the aged, sin-ravaged Dorian is especially repulsive relative to his youthful beauty. In his notebook, Albright reminded himself to make this contrast a formal part of the painting: \u201cHave two sides of [Dorian\u2019s] face grow further &amp; further apart in character tho one even showing decay the other side retaining part at least of his youth.\u201d\n\nDubuffet grasped at once why these paintings were so transgressive: ugliness not only threatens beauty, as Rosenkranz theorized, but also subverts the social order, which celebrates the former and reviles the latter. Ugliness, a word etymologically rooted in fear and dread, goes beyond surface appearances, savoring anxieties surrounding deformity, sickness, disease, abjection, and \u201cotherness\u201d broadly construed. Ugliness is subversive: it violates received notions of decorum and the socially acceptable. Frankfurt School philosopher Theodor Adorno went even further, reversing the conventional wisdom that ugliness is a perversion or corruption of beauty: \u201cIf there is any causal connection at all,\u201d Adorno wrote, \u201cbetween the beautiful and the ugly, it is from the ugly as cause to the beautiful as effect, and not the other way around.\u201d In other words, \u201cbeauty\u201d as typically understood is an attempt to deny the primal fear of the unknown and the forces of chaos and disorder. Ugliness is a jarring reminder of what lurks beneath the surface of polite society.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make a pleasant aesthetic experience,\u201d Albright once said, in something of an understatement. \u201cI want to jar the observer into thinking\u2014to make him uncomfortable.\u201d This style came as a particular shock in the 1920s, a decade associated with youth, glamour, and beauty. The pursuit of bodily perfection, embodied by glamorous movie stars, promoted through glossy magazines like Vogue and Cosmopolitan, and advertised through new consumer products, did not allow for the possibility of aging and physical decline. The fashionable young lady primping before a full-length mirror in an Edward Steichen photograph in Vogue magazine (fig. 7) could not be further from the faded melancholy of Albright\u2019s Ida. By the end of the twenties, he was virtually unique among American artists in his willingness to resist the blandishments of a youth-obsessed culture by confronting the reality of physical decrepitude and decay.\n\nAlbright painted socially marginalized figures\u2014alcoholics, laborers, prostitutes, and dispossessed artisans\u2014and relied on nonprofessional models culled largely from the working class. The title of Among Those Left (The Wheelwright, The Blacksmith) (fig. 8) signals that the blacksmith, with his brawny forearms, hammers, tongs, and wagon wheel, is as outmoded as that form of transportation. The model for Heavy the Oar to Him Who Is Tired, Heavy the Coat, Heavy the Sea (cat. 6) was a Laguna Beach fisherman of Mexican and Native American descent, whose worn features and slumped posture convey the sense of fatigue induced by the day\u2019s labor. The Farmer\u2019s Kitchen (fig. 9), a painting executed while the artist was employed by the Public Works of Art Project, is a cynical twist on a Regionalist genre scene. Instead of the ennobled rural housewife, steadfast and dutiful, he portrayed a fatigued old woman with arthritic hands as she struggles to slice a bunch of radishes.\n\nOne critic called Albright\u2019s figures \u201csimple primitive universal types . . . the simple folk [who] have kept the world going from time immemorial.\u201d If so, the world is passing them by. Rich connected their ugliness to a form of disillusionment and despair particular to the United States: \u201cIn these scabrous faces and wrinkled, puffy hands, may be read the whole backwash of pioneer optimism.\u201d In a modernizing economy, the hopes and dreams of early settlers had curdled into rank hopelessness. (Albright\u2019s grandfather, a gunsmith, had been described by his father as someone who \u201cfailed in everything he tried to do, after machinery swept his trade away in the revolving mechanized world.\u201d) Rich found a literary parallel in Edgar Lee Masters\u2019s Spoon River Anthology (1915), a sequence of free verse poems ventriloquizing the residents of a graveyard in a small Illinois town. Masters\u2019s unsparing treatment of taboos including infidelity, abortion, and rape generated controversy and outrage. Rich suggested that Albright had achieved a similar regional specificity by capturing the claustrophobic atmosphere of midwestern, small-town desperation and hopelessness, even giving his figures a corpse-like aspect. A writer for Time magazine claimed his paintings \u201clooked as though their subjects had been removed from newly opened graves.\u201d\n\nThese metaphors of disinterment and corpses rising from the grave implied some kind of infernal return. The zombie-like protagonist of And Man Created God in His Own Image (link:97:text=cat. 9)\u2014another of Albright\u2019s working-class antiheroes (the model, George Washington Stafford, was a manual laborer and union organizer)\u2014horrified critics. One called him \u201ca bleary-eyed, red-faced, elephant-skinned reprobate, divesting himself of his rags\u201d; another a \u201cBowery bum who is preparing for the night in a flop house.\u201d In a review of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s Twentieth Century Portraits exhibition, And Man Created God in His Own Image was derided as \u201cthe most hideously cynical\u201d work in the show. To portray a symbol of divine authority as a \u201cBowery bum\u201d with bloodshot eyes, a booze-blasted face, chapped lips, flabby muscles, and bloated stomach was a deliberate provocation. Possessing a kind of ruined grandeur, this image of god made flesh (or flesh made god) was a crumbling monument to humanity\u2019s presumptions and delusions. As Dubuffet observed, Albright painted \u201can abandoned world, from which all authority has retired.\u201d\n\nWhat was the source of this despairing vision? The artist\u2019s biography offers readymade explanations. First, the Oedipal explanation: Albright\u2019s father, Adam Emory Albright, had made a comfortable living selling beguiling pictures in a pseudo-Impressionist style. He enlisted his twin sons\u2014Ivan and Malvin\u2014as models for compositions such as Barnacles (fig. 10), in which the cherubic pair fish on the bank of the DuPage River. \u201cIvan was revolted by this \u2018pretty-pretty\u2019 kind of art,\u201d reported the Chicago Daily Tribune. \u201cHe hated his father\u2019s work.\u201d Ivan resolved to \u201cnever be an artist, I\u2019ll be an architect, an engineer, anything. I\u2019ll dig a ditch, plaster a wall, but I don\u2019t want to be an artist.\u201d Albright\u2019s paintings retain some of this hostility to art, especially that of the conventionally appealing variety.\n\nA second explanation has become axiomatic in the Albright literature: his military service in World War I. The United States entered the conflict in April 1917, and the following year all three Albright brothers enlisted in the army. Ivan was deployed to a base hospital in Nantes, France. A surgeon put Ivan\u2019s drawing ability to use by asking him to document an operation on a neck aneurism. From that point forward, Ivan served as the hospital\u2019s medical draftsman, documenting wounds, injuries, and treatments. He witnessed firsthand the bodily trauma requiring reconstructive surgery. Three notebooks survive of Albright\u2019s watercolor sketches of wounded soldiers made in operating rooms and hospital wards. The illustrations are largely cropped contour drawings of the wounds, accompanied by detailed information about the soldier\u2019s injury and treatment (Ivan Albright, Medical Sketchbook, see fig. 11). On the left-hand side of the page he documented the X-ray images. \u201cI became fascinated with my chance to study the human body as if with a magic eye,\u201d he recalled later. \u201cI could, by studying closely the record on each plate, imagine that I saw every human body as though it were translucent. It was the best \u2018art\u2019 training I ever had.\u201d\n\nThe relatively scant literature on Albright has treated this episode as a mythic origin story, the source of his obsession with death, the macabre, and the grotesque. But it is not a skeleton key opening all the doors of his mysterious art. The medical drawings are, in a literal sense, clinical; they served a utilitarian more than expressive purpose. But it is difficult not to detect in the mottled blood, gashes, stitched skin, and fractured bones intimations of Albright\u2019s future output. The training may at least account for his detached, pseudoscientific approach to the nature of perception and his process (Albright once compared his paintbrush to a scalpel). Yet when asked whether his experience as a medical draftsman had influenced him, he answered, \u201cNot at all. If I hadn\u2019t done that, I would have been doing something else.\u201d\n\nWhile Albright\u2019s answer may be evasive, it is nonetheless revealing. It is worth comparing him to another Chicago-based artist, German-born Carl Hoeckner, for whom World War I marked a decisive turning point. Traumatized by the war\u2019s horrors and brutalities, Hoeckner chose to abandon beauty as art\u2019s ultimate ideal. In 1937 he stated, \u201cMy art aims, up to the outbreak of the world war, were the search for and the expression of beauty. During the war I became interested in truth\u2014in bitter truth and the struggle of life in general.\u201d His large-scale painting The Homecoming (1918/19; private collection), begun soon after the armistice in November 1918 and later turned into a haunting lithograph (fig. 12), depicts a legion of spectral figures, pale and emaciated, marching toward the viewer on a via dolorosa of abject misery and pain. Hoeckner used his art to express solidarity with the suffering and vulnerable and to skewer the ruling classes in a manner similar to that of Neue Sachlichkeit artists Otto Dix and George Grosz. In The Yes-Machine (fig. 13), Hoecker depicted a fat oligarch in a tuxedo sitting at a banquet table surrounded by cadaverous yes-men. In the background a pair of hulking police officers flank the gears and wheels of a bank vault. On the table sits a bottle of champagne, a horn of plenty full of fruit and flowers, and a roasted pig, the oligarch\u2019s bloated double.\n\nThe socialist Hoeckner employed caricature and grotesquerie to make pointed statements about the horrors of war and the evils of the ruling class. Albright\u2019s \u201cugliness\u201d is of a different order; it would be going too far to claim him as a champion of the marginalized and oppressed. In fact, in a self-portrait from 1935 (cat. 14), Albright is adorned in strikingly similarly fashion to Hoeckner\u2019s plutocrat: he wears a tuxedo and holds aloft a glass of wine. He is seated at a table strewn with markers of luxury: wine, cigarettes, a cut-glass vase, an ashtray, a decanter. In this portrait commissioned by his friend and Chicago advertising executive Earle Ludgin, Albright represented himself as dissolute dandy\u2014cultured, decadent, and sensual. Thirty-eight at the time of the commission, the artist appears much older, as if imagining how his own Dorian Gray portrait might look, rotting away in an attic.\n\nWhile Albright was not an explicitly social or political commentator in the vein of Hoeckner, his artwork belonged to an ambitious project\u2014recognized by Dubuffet\u2014to undermine the most cherished tenets of Western civilization. Albright used ugliness as a form of critical resistance to the blandishments of beauty imposed by mass culture. He challenged the idea that the body is a discrete, sealed-off entity, easily categorized as beautiful or ugly. This concept of \u201cflesh\u201d\u2014a philosophical as much as an aesthetic concept\u2014upended those boundaries in a more expansive vision.\n\nIn his notes while executing The Vermonter (cat. 22), one of his last major paintings before his death in 1983, Albright noted, \u201cFlesh will only look like, behave like flesh if it is knitted together so closely that it becomes one\u2014color and transparency and shadow luminous\u2014becomes part of bone and part of blood vessel and becomes with movement one.\u201d Here Albright\u2019s notion of flesh encompasses skin, bone, blood, color, shadow, and movement. While other painters had simply transcribed the static surface of things, he aimed to capture motion and stillness, skin and blood, surface and depth. He wondered, \u201cWho in all the world before one has painted flesh. Name one. Many have tried but none have ever come close to flesh-flesh.\u201d\n\nBetween April 1981 and August 1983, Albright produced his final artistic statement and arguably most ambitious exploration of \u201cflesh-flesh\u201d: a series of more than twenty self-portraits (cats. 25\u201344). Aware that he would not have time to complete a major composition, he turned his unsparing gaze to his own aging flesh and transcribed with exacting rigor every wrinkle, fold, and blemish. Painted on hardboard, each portrait no more than one foot in width and height, the series showcases a variety of styles and media, ranging from loose and sketchy charcoal to carefully delineated oil. His features likewise run a gamut of emotions, from serene and contemplative to wide-eyed dismay and terror. He made three of the works after suffering a debilitating stroke; he executed the final self-portrait three days before he died\u2014a poignantly simple work in pastel and colored pencil inscribed with his name, date, and the location \u201cAscutney Hospital, Vermont.\u201d\n\nThis is a powerful and haunting series, earning comparisons to Rembrandt\u2019s late self-portraits. The effect is that of an unsettling hall of mirrors multiplying a fragmenting self in the process of decay. Painted over the course of three years, the series incorporates a sense of flux, motion, and passing time. As art historian Richard Brettell observed of these late works, motion was central to Albright\u2019s concept of flesh, which formed \u201cpart of a continuum of motion governed beyond us.\u201d These paintings are not memento mori in the conventional sense; they are less reminders of the death that awaits us all than attempts to figure death into life as a dynamic, interrelated process. Albright asked, \u201cAre there such things as death and decay? In any part of life you find something either growing or disintegrating. All life is strong and powerful, even in the process of dissolution.\u201d\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">For an account of Albright\u2019s working methods on Poor Room, see Marilyn Robb, \u201cIvan Albright Paints a Picture,\u201d Art News 49, no. 4 (Summer 1950): 44\u201347, 58, 59.
