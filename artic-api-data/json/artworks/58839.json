    "description": "<p>Born in France, Gaston Lachaise immigrated to the United States when he was 24 years old. He modeled <em>Woman (Elevation)</em> after Isabel Dutaud Nagle, whom he married in 1917, telling her, \u201cI want to create a miracle with it\u2026 as great as you.\u201d Although it definitely evokes his subject\u2019s appearance, this sculpture represents Lachaise\u2019s first full-scale expression of the idealized female form that would come to dominate his art. The figure\u2019s long legs support a voluptuous torso that recalls ancient fertility goddesses and a disproportionally small waist that accentuates her ample hips and breasts. Modernists like Lachaise were fascinated by preclassical art because they believed it possessed a primitive vitality absent from later art forms.</p>\n",
