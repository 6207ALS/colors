    "copy": " We\u2019re excited to welcome youth groups during the summer for guided or self-guided experiences. Guided tours offer participants opportunities for close looking, conversation, and creative responses to works of art, and all tours can be paired with an hour-long studio-based experience. Bilingual education staff are available and offer experiences in Spanish and English. Just select a bilingual experience when scheduling your visit. Registration for summer youth group visits opens in spring 2024.   Whether coming to the museum for a self-guided or guided tour, you can always access a range of resources for pre- and post-visit activities. Visit our Create and Learn page to find artmaking activities and other materials designed for educators\u2019 use.   Logistical Information   Questions about summer tours?
