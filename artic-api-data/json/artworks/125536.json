    "description": "<p>Berenice Abbott\u2019s Changing New York project, an ambitious attempt to record the rapid mutations of modern-day New York, found great support in the galleries and museums of the city. In 1930, at the beginning of her research, Abbott showed her photographs at the Museum of Modern Art, a success followed by one-person exhibitions at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932 and the Museum of the City of New York in 1934. Abbott also received funding from the Works Progress Administration\u2019s (WPA) Federal Arts Project, as noted in this photograph\u2019s credit line. Her application to the WPA addressed New York\u2019s fast tempo and emphasized \u201cthe vanishing instant,\u201d yet Abbott\u2019s studiously detailed compositions, prepared with a large-format camera and tripod, do not reflect this sense of rapidity. Abbott hoped her images would ultimately be valued as \u201cmemorials of the metropolis.\u201d</p>\n",
