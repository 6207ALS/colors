Materials from the artist\u2019s time in Brittany, from his memory, and from his immediate Tahitian surroundings combine in unfathomable, composite scenes. The resulting works are not strictly a series; but in style and invention, quite clearly, they belong to a focused campaign of production.\n\nGauguin\u2019s motivations in creating the works are unclear. As Peter Zegers explains in an introduction to his descriptive entries, in early 1896, when the art dealer Ambroise Vollard first wrote to propose that Gauguin produce a new woodcut, the artist was incredulous. Isolated in Tahiti, without access to a press, the idea of creating an edition of one hundred prints must have seemed impossible. \u201cBut what is he thinking of? How does he expect me to do this here?,\u201d he exclaimed in a letter to his friend \u00c9mile Schuffenecker.\n\nA better solution, Gauguin surmised, would be to produce transfer lithographs that could be printed in quantity in France. But this was of little interest to the dealer, who continued to encourage him to make prints and who sent him crayons and paper to that end as the year drew to a close. Vollard, ever attuned to the machinations of the contemporary art world, was no doubt aware that other avant-garde artists were already making headway in a revival of wood-block printing. Several Nabi artists had begun to experiment with xylography and wood engraving in the 1880s, and in 1891, in his catalogue introduction for the third annual exhibition of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Peintres-Graveurs Fran\u00e7ais, the critic Roger Marx described the woodcut as a method that \u201cfears no rival with regard to intensity of expression, showing itself capable of every liberty, every audacity, every delicacy.\u201d Some writers even suggested that wood engravers should work against refinement in their printmaking. In 1892, incensed at editorial refusal to publish F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s prints for the collected volume Badauderies Parisiennes: Les rassemblements; Physiologie de la rue, the writer Octave Uzanne argued, \u201cIt is not by the fineness of the wood that the young engravers will recover the glory and the success of the vanished masters, it is rather by the brutality of the means, by a return to the primitive facture.\u201d The fact that Gauguin was now overseas\u2014and would make his print in a country that Parisians viewed as precivilized\u2014would no doubt add to its potentially \u201cprimitive\u201d allure.\n\nBefore he left for his second trip to Tahiti, in 1895, Gauguin\u2019s wood engraving had been a direct source of inspiration for some of the most pioneering printmakers engaged in the revival. In the summer of 1894, when the artist was staying at the Pension Gloanec in Pont-Aven, a broken tibia had prevented him from standing to paint. In order to keep working, much to the fascination of his fellow guests, he had shifted his focus to carving. One of them\u2014a fellow wood worker\u2014was the playwright Alfred Jarry, who in 1895 went on to publish L\u2019ymagier. This review, realized in collaboration with the writer and editor Remy de Gourmont, included historic wood-block prints, popular \u00c9pinal prints, and new imagery invented by the editors and their contemporaries. Although many of the Pont-Aven artists contributed to the publication (it included works by \u00c9mile Bernard, Charles Filiger, and Armand S\u00e9guin), Gauguin declined Jarry\u2019s offer to participate. Nevertheless, a strange print (Field 1973 26) appeared in the third issue of the periodical, marked with Gauguin\u2019s monogram (fig. 1). A shorter notice in the January 1895 issue reported seeing \u201cbeautiful new woodcuts\u201d by Gauguin that were at once \u201cclassic and barbaric, purposeful and spirited.\u201d Perhaps Vollard, sensing how pivotal Gauguin was to his admirers, imagined he would easily find buyers for a large edition of a genuine woodcut. The trend for the medium seemed strong.\n\nEven though Jarry had fallen out with Gourmant, by 1896 he had committed his savings to Perhinderion, a more luxurious publication that would likewise feature wood-block prints. It was another three years before Gauguin finally took up Vollard\u2019s suggestion, however, and by then both L\u2019ymagier and Perhinderion had met with financial failure. Perhaps for this reason, the dealer\u2019s interest in the idea had waned; and when he finally saw the artist\u2019s new prints, he wrote to Daniel de Monfreid, who had acted as an intermediary between the artist and dealer, exclaiming that they were of no use to him. Monfreid took the works back, selling just a few and distributing others to Gauguin\u2019s friends in accordance with the artist\u2019s instructions.\n\nIf Vollard was uninterested in the late prints, conversely, the artist evidently took pride in his achievement. Perhaps prompted by Maurice Denis\u2019s 1899 hope (never realized) to mark the tenth anniversary of the 1889 Volpini exhibition, he planned to show them at the time of the 1900 World\u2019s Fair, together with his work in other media. Having gone to the trouble of producing so many with limited resources and believing them to be of artistic interest, he was dismayed that they proved unpopular in Paris. But they clearly had personal meaning; at least forty-five impressions of the prints decorated the walls of his final residence in Hiva Oa. This is no doubt why, in addition to considering the content of the individual prints, scholars have interpreted the works as a frieze. When the prints are placed in different sequences, according to size, format, or content, particular meanings emerge. In 1988 this prompted Richard Brettell and Peter Zegers to propose that the late wood-block prints were a series, akin to the Volpini Suite (cats. 11\u201321) and Noa Noa (cats. 51\u201360).\n\nIdentifying Te atua as the title plate of the series, Brettell and Zegers read connections between individual images in the group; when, for instance, Te atua and The Rape of Europa are placed side by side, the gaze of the figure at the far right of the former meets that of the figure at the far left of the latter. They grouped together four prints that they suggested follow a loose theme of paradise: Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Women, Animals, and Foliage (cat. 97), Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98), and Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil (cat. 99), citing their similarities in format and scale and their peripheral imagery of flowers and foliage. They also paired the technically similar Change of Residence (cat. 104) and Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). Situated alongside each other, these two prints might read as a single work; suggestive of a rolling hill, a curved line joins the two images in this hypothetical arrangement. Brettell and Zegers also paired the two largest late wood-block prints, Buddha (cat. 101) and Eve (cat. 100), connecting their diverse religious iconography with the belief in a universal spirituality that Gauguin expressed in his writings on Roman Catholicism. The absolute meaning of the groupings remains opaque, however, and, declining to present the sequences as definitive, Brettell and Zegers acknowledged that Gauguin could have intended the purchaser to create an arrangement of his or her own. As for the artist\u2019s statements on the works, the only indication that he left of a presentation strategy is vague. He instructed Monfreid to frame them well, either individually or two by two, which would have allowed for a multitude of types of display.\n\nElaborating on the idea that no definitive order for the wood-block prints exists, in 2012, Elizabeth Prelinger suggested that Gauguin did not design them with a narrative in mind. Instead, she likened the individual works to the functioning components of a nineteenth-century \u201cmyriorama\u201d: a collection of cards that, featuring different views, could be grouped together in different arrangements to create multiple meanings and aesthetic effects (see fig. 2). As she observed, such a strategy would make the prints the visual equivalent of the poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s unfinished Livre, whose component pages were left unbound so as to allow the reader to sequence them and interpret their contents at leisure. Starr Figura, writing on the late wood-block prints in 2014, observed that this apparent invitation to arrange and rearrange scenes connects with the artist\u2019s own predisposition to reuse and transform imagery. Unless the prints were mounted onto a stronger support, the thin paper that Gauguin used for them seems incompatible with the idea of manipulating them frequently. But Prelinger\u2019s alignment of the group with broader Symbolist ideas is suggestive, as it gives a sense of the reception Gauguin might have anticipated for the prints in Paris. This was an environment where the unpredictability of chance\u2014as Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s famous 1897 poem Un coup de d\u00e9s jamais n\u2019abolira le hasard (A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance) testifies\u2014was an intellectual preoccupation. Developing this idea by comparing the prints to other types of Symbolist activity prompts new ways of seeing these relatively understudied works.\n\nIn Paris, in the mid-1890s, exchanges and rivalries between visual and literary artists were commonplace; if Gauguin was well respected by poets who appreciated his intellectual character, his strong ideas about the role of their craft sometimes caused upset. Many writers believed words to be better suited than images to expressing the essence of the \u201cidea\u201d images, in conventional understanding, were tied to the literal task of representation. However, as Linda Goddard observed, Gauguin seems to have contested that notion. Particularly in his Noa Noa\u2014Voyage de Tahiti, his written explanations of paintings do not correlate with the works themselves; in turn, the prints that accompany his text differ from his written interpretations. Through the constant redistribution of texts and images in his art, Goddard argued, Gauguin disrupted the connections between sources and their contexts, making it impossible to distinguish between fact and fiction. Since he was increasingly keen to free his work from description as the years went by, in the case of the late wood-block prints, a search for definitive meaning is doubly futile. Categorically, in an 1895 interview, the artist made clear that his arrangements of color and line were deliberately nondescriptive.\n\nIn light of Gauguin\u2019s contact with Jarry, moreover, the possibility exists that the works were to an extent conceived of as anti-narrative. Later in the same year that Vollard wrote to Gauguin to suggest he make a print, Jarry\u2019s absurdist play Ubu roi (King Ubu) appeared on stage for the first time, to the shock and excitement of contemporary audiences. Just as that premiere marked a shift in performance strategies, it is possible that the late wood-block prints signaled a comparable move to present content as simultaneously legible and disconcerting. Challenging conventional aesthetics, both presented their content in an incongruous, disjointed style. From his praise of the play in his independently produced journal, Le sourire, it is clear that Gauguin admired King Ubu. Also in Le sourire, Gauguin published a \u201creview\u201d of a Polynesian play about incest, further evidence of his interest in theatricality. If, as Mel Becker Solomon suggests, certain of Gauguin\u2019s late transfer monotypes take on the appearance of stage sets (see cat. 126), arguably so too do some of the late wood-block prints. Several have evident borders: Interior of a Tahitian Hut (cat. 92) reproduces the untouched wood grain at the edge of the image (see Technical Overview), while Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) exhibits a number of vertical lines to the left and right, made by the ridges of the saw that Gauguin used to divide the block in half (see Technical Overview). These devices act as curtains, emphasizing the artificial nature of the scenes and adding a heightened sense of drama.\n\nJarry\u2019s play and Gauguin\u2019s wood-block prints also share a predominantly frontal presentation of action. At the time of the debut of King Ubu, the playwright instructed the actors to play directly to the audience\u2014instead of prioritizing interaction with one another\u2014and to use wildly exaggerated gestures. As if to underline the constructed nature of performance, he indicated scene changes with placards, asking the audience to make leaps of space and time using little more than their imagination. He also insisted that the actors wear masks, obscuring their individuality and preventing facial expression. Perhaps Gauguin, whose work had long emphasized its flatness, also sought to test the boundaries between the real and the conceptual in comparable ways. In many of the late wood-block prints, the figures engage with the viewer directly, such as in Women, Animals, and Foliage (cat. 97 and in Eve (cat. 100), where the protagonist raises her hand to her face in a stock expression of distress. The inclusion of the artist\u2019s monogram in the images, meanwhile, indicates to viewers that the realm they have entered is particular to the artist\u2019s imagination. Gauguin set self-contained scenes in implausible spaces, wherein the relationships between characters are unclear. Furthermore, the figures themselves are ambiguous, culled from Gauguin\u2019s previous works and those of others. Even within the series, in Women, Animals, and Foliage and Change of Residence (cat. 104), for instance, variations on the same grouping of copulating animals and a preening bird appear. Their individuality is suppressed in the service of the artist\u2019s overarching creative project.\n\nGauguin\u2019s late wood-block prints might also connect with Jarry in their physicality. In addition to his recorded personal contact with the playwright in Pont-Aven, as a subscriber to the Mercure de France and a keen follower of his critical reception in the press, Gauguin was surely aware of the \u201cKing of the Fragrant Isle\u201d characterization of the artist that Jarry published in 1898. Therein Gauguin appears as a leader who \u201cprunes with an axe from the images of living wood the growths that would disfigure their likeness to the gods.\u201d Perhaps poetically this encouraged the artist in his use of the wood available to him locally for printmaking purposes. Dario Gamboni argued convincingly that Gauguin allowed materials to shape his working processes. Wood dictates its use: a living organism, structured by the history of its growth, it lends itself to the anthropomorphism typical of the artist\u2019s work. In many of the images, particularly those where a greater amount of the printing area is covered with ink (for example, The Rape of Europa [cat. 102]), the irregular surface of the wood impacted clearly on the final image. The block for the work\u2014which, contrary to Gauguin\u2019s profession to Vollard, he did not destroy\u2014is owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and shows natural variations that, for all its aesthetic interest, would have made carving a challenge (fig. 3). However, if at first Gauguin found the use of easily available woods a hindrance (he deemed what he could obtain to be poor in quality), perhaps ultimately the material proved liberating. As shown in the Technical Overview, on occasion when making these late prints, Gauguin cut through blocks in order to create a second working surface. Ostensibly, this was because wood blocks of any quality were in short supply, but by doing so he might also have ceded further control to his materials. Significantly, when in 1900 the artist wrote to tell Vollard about the prints, he expressed pride in what he claimed was his unique ability to reuse wood blocks. This repurposing might offer alternative ways of connecting seemingly unrelated scenes in the group. If The Rape of Europa and Te atua share the same genealogy, for instance, their relationship is perhaps less the cerebral link suggested by Brettell and more the physical connection of the curved lower edge of the former image that became (and perhaps even prompted) the arched canopies of the interior in the latter.\n\nLikewise, perhaps the linear, horizontal grain of Change of Residence encouraged the artist to produce the continuation found in Soyez amoureuses (cat. 105). Although the two images seem to connect formally, through the intertwined circular motifs to their right and left sides, they are harder to align conceptually (Richard S. Field, in a recent analysis of Soyez amoureuses, chose to read these works independently). The physical production of the wood-block prints, to an artist who gave precedence to materials, offers a more practical logic for the relationship between the two images. Comparably, the physical qualities of the blocks might also account for the relationship of Buddha to Eve. After printing Buddha and perhaps realizing the extent of the striations created by the wood grain, the artist chose to make a second print, Eve, which does not rely on the uniform darkness of the background. With large areas of wood cut away, Eve reverses the tonal balance of Buddha; perhaps this formal departure also suggested the need for a spiritual subject from a different religious tradition.\n\nA statement that Jarry made at the opening of his collection of short pieces Les minutes de sable: M\u00e9morial (1894)\u2014an assertion of the ultimate authority of the author\u2014might also ring true of Gauguin\u2019s creative practice in the 1890s. It focuses on how the abiding meaning in a work is personal to the creator; no other can grasp its true sense. \u201cBy reason of the fact that one has written the work oneself,\u201d Jarry argued, \u201cone has the advantage of active superiority over the passive listener. Every meaning that the reader will find has been foreseen and he will never find all of them; the author can play Blind Man\u2019s Buff with his poor brain, suggesting unexpected posterior and even contradictory ones.\u201d But as Gamboni observed, unlike the playwright, Gauguin appears to have cared less about interpretive control. Using increasingly obscure means of production, he seems instead to have used obfuscation to distance himself even from his own creative output. On the disjuncture between his verbal descriptions of his images and their literal content, Gauguin wrote, \u201cAll this is intangible, they say. I am willing to agree.\u201d Perhaps the use of coarsely grained wood blocks\u2014like his employment of glass in his transfer monotypes\u2014allowed the artist to generate meaning that was ultimately beyond even his own control.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Back in Tahiti in 1898\u201399, Gauguin produced a series of fifteen wood-block prints using indigenous, reclaimed wood, black ink thinned with a large proportion of binder, and two types of paper. He printed the group of irregularly shaped wood blocks by hand without a press. None of these materials were well suited to the ambitious task that Gauguin had set for himself. However, by this time, three years after his return to Tahiti, the artist had no choice but to embrace what was at hand for art-making purposes, given that good-quality art materials were not forthcoming from Paris. The Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints is indicative of Gauguin\u2019s inventiveness and resourcefulness, his recycling of well-worn subject matter from throughout his oeuvre, and the narrative happenstance of seemingly random combinations of imagery.\n\nIn the spring of 1896, the dealer Ambroise Vollard had urged Gauguin to produce a commercially viable print in an edition of one hundred that he could market in Paris (see Commentary). To do so would require the artist to maintain some consistency in his materials and methods of printing. It would also require the customary markings of edition number and signature. The degree to which Gauguin could successfully achieve this depended in large part on the availability of wood blocks, inks, and papers, and most importantly, the determination to take a more disciplined approach to print production to meet the standards of the fastidious Vollard. It was not until 1898\u201399 that Gauguin was willing to seriously consider such an undertaking, perhaps because, if successful, such a series would provide the artist with much-needed funds.\n\nDespite his best intentions, several factors worked against the artist. First, it was impossible to find commercially manufactured wood blocks for this printing, much less those of the quality that he was accustomed to using in Paris for his Noa Noa Suite and the various smaller prints that he produced immediately thereafter. He carved a sculpture (fig. 4) and for this suite several wood blocks for printing (see cats. 99, 102, and 103) (fig. 5 and fig. 6) from indigenous pieces of tropical wood of irregular shapes and sizes. Others were fashioned from discarded planks of wood (fig. 7, fig. 8, and fig. 9) (see cats. 96, 97, 104, and 105). While Gauguin lamented the poor quality of this wood, he retained the grain irregularities and striations formed by the saw with which he cut the blocks. Incorporating these parallel lines into the frieze-like structure would evolve within the print series (fig. 10). Also, unlike end-grain boxwood, which was hard and allowed for the finest of lines to be incised into its surface, the indigenous wood Gauguin procured in Tahiti appears to have been softer and more susceptible to splintering. This may have been simply the result of cutting the wood with the grain rather than perpendicular to it. Despite the cause, the artist provided structural stability to the blocks by retaining significant borders of uncarved wood around the various vignettes he carved into them (fig. 11 and fig. 12). These borders were aesthetically integrated into his compositions, and in some passages the borders of the printed image mirror the irregular outer contours of the wood blocks (fig. 13). At the same time, the large borders served a practical purpose, preventing the edges of the blocks from breaking under the weight of the ink roller and the pressure applied to the block when transferring the ink onto the paper.\n\nGauguin prided himself on his unique manipulation of wood, boasting \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice, and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d If read literally, this statement could at first glance indicate that the artist carved images into one side of five wood blocks and then proceeded to use both sides of five more blocks\u2014a common practice for artists with limited resources. Yet Gauguin was emphatic that no other artist made prints like this. How, then, did his method differ? Exhaustive study of the dimensions, contours, grain patterns, and surface textures of the group of prints, and the blocks that still exist for some of them, reveals that Gauguin took the thick, irregular pieces of wood he found in Tahiti, including more rectilinear planks, and crudely cut them down laterally to reduce their thickness. Taking into consideration that the indigenous wood was not commercially manufactured into regularly sized blocks, the unusual, irregular contours and grain in the wood used by Gauguin provide topographical reference points that allow them to be matched and paired. Five such pairs were identified during the course of this study. These include Wayside Shrine in Brittany and The Ox Cart (cats. 93 and 94); Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) and Women, Animals, and Foliage (cats. 96 and 97); Eve and Buddha (cats. 100 and 101); The Rape of Europa and Te atua (The God) (cats. 102 and 103); and Change of Residence and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cats. 104 and 105). In addition to the ten images printed on these \u201cpaired\u201d blocks, a sixth print, Human Miseries (cat. 95), appears to derive from an adjacent section of the same plank on which Eve and Buddha were carved since it reproduces an identical grain pattern and surface texture (fig. 14). Only four wood-block prints in the group, At the Black Rocks (cat. 91), Interior of a Tahitian Hut (cat. 92), Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98), and Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil (cat. 99), appear to have been printed on singular, unique blocks. Gauguin\u2019s resourcefulness, clearly born of necessity, resulted in the production of prints that reproduced the contours and surface textures present in this most unusual group of wood blocks. Their overall appearance is unprecedented in his graphic production up to this point.\n\nFurthermore, to produce the number of impressions needed for a commercial edition of approximately four hundred would require a significant amount of good-quality printing paper. With none forthcoming from Paris, Gauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight Japanese paper made with mitsumata fibers and little sizing. The diaphanous sheets are translucent, extraordinarily fragile, and easily damaged. This not only made printing a challenge; the practicality of mounting sets for sale would require a significant amount of time and effort that Vollard was unlikely to provide. And for Gauguin to mount them in Tahiti before sending them to Paris would have required a stock of heavier paper that was simply unavailable (or unaffordable). The fashion of the time would have dictated that, during the printing process, diaphanous papers such as these were mounted onto secondary supports of heavier, more robust plate papers in the form of chine coll\u00e9. Perhaps the prospect of having to mount hundreds of prints sent by the artist may help to explain Vollard\u2019s unenthusiastic response upon receiving them in Paris, not to mention Gauguin\u2019s disregard of his dealer\u2019s suggestion to produce one print, not a suite of fifteen! Additionally, public response to Gauguin\u2019s work at the time was lukewarm at best. It was unlikely that Gauguin would receive immediate critical acclaim and financial gain from the display and sale of this unusual group of prints, nor was it likely to be a lucrative undertaking for Vollard. Despite his initial rejection of the prints, in 1905, as Gauguin\u2019s art became more well known and sought after, Vollard\u2019s desire to capitalize on the artist\u2019s posthumous success came in the form of a letter to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid requesting that the group again be made available to him for potential sale.\n\nIn Tahiti, working without a press, Gauguin seems to have overcome the problem of printing on the fine mitsumata paper by developing a method in which he placed a sheet on the inked block and then covered it with a second sheet of sturdier paper; this way he could apply pressure without tearing the delicate sheet below. The sturdier paper was not of the fine quality of plate papers used in the production of chine coll\u00e9s, but rather an ordinary paper of medium weight that the artist also used to print impressions of Change of Residence (cat. 104) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (cat. 105). Similarly, to lift a wet, ink-laden sheet of the thin paper from the block would have proven impossible without a secondary support to provide stability. Working in this manner, Gauguin could immediately see the benefit of mounting one paper onto the other; he also saw that he could simply flip the translucent paper over, so that the verso would become the recto, thereby creating mirror image impressions as well. These advances in printing methodology are evident in the latter group of prints he produced for the suite: Te atua (The God) (cat. 103), Change of Residence (cat. 104), and Soyez amoureuses (cat. 105). The artist double-printed several of these impressions just as he had done for many impressions of his Noa Noa Suite of wood-block prints. He also adhered second-state impressions printed on diaphanous papers onto first-state impressions of the same print so that imagery from the first state impression could be seen through the second-state impression (see cats. 104.2 and 105.2). As suggested by Gauguin scholar Peter Zegers, often these methods were used with the intent that the prints be viewed in transmitted light, perhaps against a window or before candlelight (fig. 15).\n\nIt has been recorded that Gauguin pasted forty-five impressions of his suite of late wood-block prints onto three walls of his Marquesan residence. Considering that the suite consisted of fifteen prints, it is plausible that he used three sets, one on each wall, perhaps arranging them in different combinations or friezes. He seemingly proposed no formal order among them. Peter Zegers was the first to propose a compelling arrangement of the prints into friezes. Thereafter scholars further speculated that the artist intended no formal order but instead provided an opportunity for them to be displayed randomly in any number of combinations (see Commentary). While this is quite plausible, one wonders how this would have been achieved with such thin, fragile papers unless they were subsequently adhered onto more substantial papers for support so they could be manipulated without damage. Uncharacteristically, the artist gave no instructions for their mounting.\n\nWhatever Gauguin\u2019s final intentions were for this ambitious print production, he used enormous ingenuity to form blocks for printing from inferior pieces of wood, printed them on papers that most printers would find completely unsuitable to the task with inks cut with significant amounts of oil. Despite this, the suite remains a testament to the artist\u2019s continued tenacity late into his career, using unconventional materials and techniques, at a time when both money and recognition were in short supply.  \nHarriet K.

Field interpreted Soyez amoureuses in relation to Gauguin\u2019s critical take on marriage in Western society; it is hard to reconcile his reading with the content of Change of Residence, which is more easily legible as one of the artist\u2019s stylized composite landscapes.

See, for example, Richard R. Brettell with Peter Zegers, \u201cSuite of Late Woodcuts, 1898\u20131899,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F.

(Prestel, 2012), p. 103. However, had the artist produced fourteen prints, then if half of the blocks were used twice, as he stated, the suite would have comprised twenty-one prints. Careful study of the prints, the extant blocks, and Gauguin\u2019s own account reflect that fifteen prints were produced for the suite.\n\nSee Douglas Druick, \u201cLove, And You Will Be Happy/Change of Residence,\u201d in Douglas Druick, Ann Dumas, Gloria Groom, Anne Roquebert, and Gary Tinterow, C\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde, ed.

See also H\u00f4tel Drouot, Pr\u00e9cieux autographes de Monsieur Alfred Dupont, sale cat. (H\u00f4tel Drouot, Dec. 3\u20134, 1958), no. 115, in which a letter from Gauguin to Schuffenecker discussing this matter is transcribed.\n\nParau hanohano (Terrifying Words) (private collection [Gray 134]), a sculpture of uncertain date carved from an irregularly shaped piece of indigenous wood, is thematically and compositionally related to Gauguin\u2019s 1892 canvas of the same title (private collection W 460]). The sculpture bears striations identical to those on the printing blocks, similarly carved from \u201cdiscarded\u201d wood, of Wayside Shrine in Brittany (cat. 93) and The Ox Cart (cat. 94). Although Parau hanohano may have been produced with wood-block printing in mind, no known prints can be directly related to it, and the piece was transformed into an independent sculpture. A similar duality exists in Manao tupapau of 1894/95 [Kornfeld 29], carved from a large plank of wood from which Gauguin printed seven impressions (see cats. 77 and 78). He then returned to the block and transformed the wood into a more deeply carved, sanded, and smoothed bas-relief frieze that was at once independent of, yet inextricably linked to, the print that preceded it.\n\nLibu\u0161e S\u00fdkorov\u00e1 suggests that these wood fragments could have derived from crates or from an old piece of furniture such as a chair or cabinet into which the striations were previously cut. See Gauguin Woodcuts (P. Hamlyn, 1963), pp. 8\u20139. I maintain that Gauguin cut these himself to his desired size and shape. The posthumous inventory of his belongings lists three handsaws (scies \u00e9go\u00efne) among a variety of tools. See Georges Wildenstein, \u201cInventaire des biens de Gauguin: 27 mai 1903,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts 6th ser., 47 (Jan.\u2013Apr. 1956), pp. 201\u201304.\n\nGauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 1899, in Lettres de Gauguin a Daniel de Monfreid, ed. Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151. While Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveal that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nGauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190. See also Richard R. Brettell with Peter Zegers, \u201cSuite of Late Woodcuts, 1898\u20131899,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F. Stuckey, The Art of Paul Gauguin, with assistance from Peter Zegers, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice. For paired examples where wood blocks originally formed one thicker block, see cats. 93 and 94, 96 and 97, 100 and 101, and 102 and 103.\n\nHuman Miseries was carved with the block oriented in a horizontal position. When impressions are turned 90 degrees and placed side by side with impression of the two vertically oriented compositions in the related blocks, the correspondence between the wood grain and surface texture in all three becomes apparent.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2), and mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality,weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nSee Douglas Druick, \u201cLove, And You Will Be Happy/Change of Residence,\u201d in Douglas Druick, Ann Dumas, Gloria Groom, Anne Roquebert, and Gary Tinterow, C\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde, ed.
