Deep ribbed bowl fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled to create exterior ribs, and polished. Flared rim, rounded by grinding, bends down into a deep bowl with segments of four tooled vertical ribs preserved on the exterior. Large canes of deep blue, yellow-brown, and perhaps powder blue, all separated by thin bands of white, undulate in loose spirals folded back on themselves.\n\nA section of rim is preserved, other edges are broken. The overall surface is dull with patches of light-brown incrustation and varying degrees of weathering and pitting depending on the veining. The veins, which seem to be powder blue, are particularly weathered, making the color difficult to confirm.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 88 Fragment of a Bowl, late 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
