Patterson given in memory of Tiffany Blake, 1945.15\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Manet first laid down The rue Mosnier with Gas Lamp with quick strokes in graphite. He then worked with a brush and tusche to delineate and shade elements of the street scene and the human figures. Many of the tusche and graphite marks exceed the edges of the paper, which suggests that the original and secondary supports were trimmed at the edges. Manet executed the sketch on a semi-transparent lithographic transfer paper. The drawing was never made into a print, since the transfer paper would have been destroyed when laid on the stone and processed for printing. However, the drawing was backed or laid down onto a secondary support of wove paper, possibly as a preservation measure.\n\nThe rue Mosnier with Gas Lamp was drawn in graphite pencil with brush and tusche. Manet applied the pencil first, followed by the tusche. Both were applied in a direct and additive manner. Subtractive techniques and blending are not present. Manet may have used the tusche with the idea of printing the image, but he seems to have abandoned the idea as the tusche application is only partial.\n\nThe tusche exhibits a characteristic network-like reticulation pattern on the transfer paper support. Tusche was sold in paste and stick form, and artists diluted it with water to produce the desired ink density. Tusche was formulated for use on porous lithography stones, not the slick surface of transfer paper, and Manet may have struggled to control the medium as it dried, as evidenced by a partial fingerprint at lower right (fig. 17.1).\n\nThis drawing was executed on transfer paper, which artists normally used to have their work printed as lithographs. Lithography, a printmaking technique based on the principle that grease and water do not mix, begins with an image drawn in crayon or tusche on a limestone block. The stone is treated in a way that makes the drawn areas receptive to the oily printing ink, while the blank portions of the stone repel the ink. During printing, a flatbed lithographic press uses pressure to transfer the image to paper. As with all direct printing techniques, lithography requires the artist to draw the image in reverse. Transfer paper enables artists to avoid this complication. The artist draws or writes on the transfer paper with a greasy crayon or tusche. The transfer paper is then placed face down on the stone and the paper is dampened to transfer the greasy media to the stone. The transfer paper is then removed to expose the drawing, which is backwards. Next the stone is treated so that only the tusche or crayon absorbs ink. Finally, the image is printed. Since the printing process produces a mirror image, this printed image reads correctly.\n\nThe transfer paper Manet used for The rue Mosnier with Gas Lamp is transparent or semi-transparent wove paper, prepared on one side with a water-soluble coating. The coating is described in period sources as consisting of gums, starches, glues, isinglass, alum, plaster of Paris, and colorants such as gamboge. In raking light, the paper\u2019s surface is smooth and thus it perfectly captured the artist\u2019s brushwork. If this drawing had been transferred to a lithographic stone, the paper would have been dampened and placed face down on the stone. The oily drawing media (not the graphite) would have bound to the stone, and the transfer paper would have been rubbed away. The drawing survives only because it was not used for transfer.\n\nThe color of the primary support may be classified as beige but it is difficult to determine how the secondary support and staining from light exposure have affected it.\n\nThe secondary support is a thin, smooth textured, beige, wove paper.\n\n277 \u00d7 441 mm\n\nThe initials E.M. appear at lower right (fig. 17.2). Under visible light these appear to be either brush applied or stamped with a dark colorant containing a high degree of binder. The binder sits on the surface of the paper and exhibits a distinct shine. Except for a few dark particles, which were probably transferred from another source, the initials are transparent under infrared radiation (fig. 17.3), indicating that the media does not contain carbon and thus might be a dye-based ink. Under ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a mild darkening is visible around the strokes, which possibly indicates that the colorant has moved horizontally within the transfer paper. No other media present on the work, in either the image or the inscriptions, display these two characteristics.\n\nAlso at lower right, in very small handwriting, is a partially legible, possibly erased graphite pencil inscription. It appears to read Inv [illegible] 3 (fig. 17.4).\n\nInscriptions on the back of the artwork are visible with transmitted infrared reflectography (fig. 17.5). Viewed from the recto, these appear in the lower left corner. They include an illegible note in a nineteenth-century hand, immediately followed by a set of numbers reading 51 37. These may be framer\u2019s notations.\n\nNo inscriptions or marks.\n\nNo inscriptions or marks.\n\nManet began the composition with gestural graphite lines. He used graphite to lay in the elements of the image and then began working with the tusche, which he also applied in a gestural manner.\n\nManet layered different dilutions of tusche to render the composition in tones ranging from medium gray to dark black. The artist also regulated the degree of saturation of his brush, and both pooled ink and almost dry brush marks are present.\n\nThe tusche appears mainly in the foreground and middle ground, although the street sweeper in the center foreground is depicted in pencil and may have suffered erasure. Manet used predominantly fluid strokes of tusche for the train engine\u2019s chimney, the fence, the curb, the lamppost, and the group of street sweepers in the left foreground, whereas he employed quick, dry strokes for the figure in the street and the hansom cab at right. The graphite design in the upper portion of the paper is untouched by the liquid media.\n\nThe transfer paper is laid down, media-side up, on a secondary support. At one time the entire construction was edge mounted to a board. Removal from that board at an unknown date caused mild skinning along the right edge.\n\nA tear is present in the center of the lower half of the sheet, within the lines delineating the knife grinder\u2019s cart.\n\nThe paper support exhibits mild overall discoloration from a natural oxidization process. The sheet suffered prolonged light exposure, resulting in darker brown staining with an abrupt shift to light beige along the protected edges of the artwork. A spatter pattern of shiny yellow aqueous material appears on the right side of the work. The sheet was evidently upright when the damage occurred, since the spatters formed tiny drips with an accumulation of aqueous material at the bottom of each stain. Observation under UV radiation reveals that the spatter marks reemit a yellow fluorescence (fig. 17.2). Skinning and mild loss of the primary and secondary support has occurred along the right lower edge. Vertical cockling is present throughout the work.\n\nSome very mild media migration is apparent around the areas of graphite application.  \nRachel Freeman\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Jacques Doucet (1853\u20131929), Paris, probably after 1908.\n\nSold by Jacques Doucet at H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Dec. 28\u201329, 1917, lot 240, to Paul Rosenberg (1881\u20131959), Paris.\n\nSold by Paul Rosenberg, New York, to the Art Institute, 1945.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Matthiesen Ltd., A Century of French Drawings: From Prud\u2019hon to Picasso, May 3\u201321, 1938, n.p., cat. 101, as Rue de Berne.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings: Old and New, 1946, p. 20, cat. 34, pl.

The inscription in the lower right corner, which reads E.M., was called an inscription or a signature in the earliest references to this drawing. Not until 1975, when Rouart and Wildenstein published their catalogue raisonne (see Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, Edouard Manet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Pastels, aquarelles et dessins [Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1975], pp. 126\u201327, no. 327 [ill.]) was the mark identified as a stamp and referenced as Lugt 880 (see Frits Lugt, Les marques de collections de dessins &amp; d\u2019estampes [Vereenigde Drukkerijen, 1921], p. 156, no. 880). Since 1975, all references to this mark have indicated that it is a stamp, specifically, the stamp used by the artist\u2019s estate. According to Lugt, the stamp was applied by Manet\u2019s widow Suzanne (n\u00e9e Leenhoff; 1829\u20131906) and in red ink. Art Institute conservators have studied the mark extensively and have concluded that it is not a stamp. As a result, the estate of the artist has been removed from the provenance. We are most grateful for the assistance of Dr. Peter Fuhring at the Fondation Custodia in this matter.\n\nEdouard Sebline to the Art Institute of Chicago, July 14, 2004, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue indicates that the drawing was available for sale and no lender was listed.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 17 The rue Mosnier with Gas Lamp, 1878.\n\nfig. 17.1 Annotated photomicrograph (8\u00d7) of the lower left quadrant of Manet\u2019s The rue Mosnier with Gas Lamp (1878).
