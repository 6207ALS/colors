StrotherAt the Piano, 1873/75  \nBlack chalk, on cream laid paper; 17.5 \u00d7 11.2 cm (6 7/8 \u00d7 4 7/16 in.)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, the Charles Deering Collection, 1927.5886\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">This lively sketch portrays Alice \u201cTinnie\u201d Greaves, the younger daughter of James McNeill Whistler\u2019s boat-building neighbors in Chelsea. Whistler enjoyed a close relationship with the Greaves family during his time living at nos. 7 and 2 Lindsey Row (1863\u201366, 1867\u201378), and Tinnie\u2019s brothers Walter and Henry became devoted pupils of the artist. Music was a common feature at their evening social gatherings, and Whistler would often use the opportunity to make sketches of Greaves family members. Walter remembered that Whistler enjoyed drawing Tinnie in particular, partly because, as Whistler reportedly remarked, she had \u201csuch a wonderfully shaped head.\u201d\n\nThe drawing\u2019s title notwithstanding, the piano is referenced only by a faint, curved line under the young woman\u2019s outstretched hand; Whistler was evidently more concerned with capturing the figure\u2019s pose and placement on the page than with depicting the activity in which she is engaged. This drawing is one of a pair that likely served as the basis for a closely related drypoint, The Piano (1875\u201377). The other sketch, now in a private collection, shows Tinnie in a similar posture from a slightly different viewpoint and is even more sparing in its detail (fig. 17.1; [M 539]). This same emphasis on gesture over context is carried over to the print, especially in its earliest state (fig. 17.2; [K 141]). Music was an important touchstone for Whistler throughout his career. It informed the subject matter of many early works and came to serve as a metaphor for the nonliteral aesthetic qualities he sought to emphasize in his art from the 1870s onward, when he began to give musically inspired titles to projects in all media. In a sense, At the Piano unites both strategies\u2014its title identifies a precise musical subject while the image itself all but negates it, placing the focus instead on the isolated form of the woman and the technical bravado of the dynamic black scrawl used to render it.\n\nAlthough the image underwent several revisions (fig. 17.3; [K 141] shows a later iteration), throughout its various states the drypoint maintains the same bold, energetic strokes Whistler relied upon to construct the figure in the sketch. He adroitly transferred his use of overlapping, scribbled lines from one medium to the other; the handling of the body of the dress and of the hands are especially notable instances of correspondence. Both charcoal and drypoint lend themselves to the creation of a type of line that is at once vivid and soft. The richly textural appearance of the charcoal translates easily into the velvety quality of the printed line. Whistler often drew figure studies in charcoal or black chalk, but the pairing with drypoint is particularly complementary. More than just a memory aid, therefore, the drawing was valuable to Whistler for the development of his formal approach as well as his subject.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">At the Piano corresponds to Margaret F.

Whistler himself identified the sitter in the closely related drypoint, The Piano, as \u201cGirl at the piano\u2014Miss Greaves\u201d in a letter to William Cleverley Alexander, Mar./Apr. 1875?, GUW, no. 07573; see the entry on The Piano, in Margaret F.

Also quoted in Pocock, Chelsea Reach, 66.\n\nAn inscription on the verso of the drawing reads: \u201cThis drawing by J. McN. Whistler / was done in chalk as a study / for the drypoint \u2018The Piano\u2019 / Ernest G. Brown.\u201d Brown was a London art dealer, a contemporary of Whistler\u2019s associated with both the Fine Art Society and the Leicester Galleries. See MacDonald (1995), 202 (cat. 538); and Frederick A. Sweet, James McNeill Whistler: Paintings, Pastels, Watercolors, Drawings, Etchings, Lithographs (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1968), 101 (cat. 81). For information on the related drawing now in a private collection, see also MacDonald (1995), 202\u20133 (cat. 539). Joseph Pennell\u2019s note on the Art Institute drawing\u2019s verso also identifies it as \u201cthe same subject as the etching\u2014The Piano.\u201d With the drypoint technique, an image is inscribed on a metal plate that is then used to pull prints; the prints that appear on paper are the reverse of the inscribed image. Whistler\u2019s two sketches in charcoal are therefore even more closely related to the image as he inscribed it on the copperplate.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 17 At the Piano, 1873/75.\n\nfig. 17.1 James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834\u20131903).
