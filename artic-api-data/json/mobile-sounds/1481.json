    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This 1978 painting by Jack Whitten is called \u201cKhee II\u201d after the letter in the Greek alphabet. A native of Alabama, Whitten came to New York in 1960. As a young African-American painter he initially struggled to find his own voice.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: In 1965 he wrote on his studio wall that he must photograph his thoughts. He was interested in the idea of recording an image where the camera couldn\u2019t go. And his studio became a sort of laboratory for achieving this photographic effect.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Working on the floor or a tabletop Whitten began by placing flat objects under a canvas and creating an impression of them. He then painted the canvas with Gesso a white primer or ground color. While the paint was still wet he placed thin sheets of colored rice paper on top, allowing them to dissolve and leave behind traces of pure pigment. Whitten finished by raking various tools across the surface combs, rubbers, wire or notch metal as if to develop the painting surface like a photograph. The results often surprised him.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: It was really about the process and bringing the process to light.  As Whitten put it, once, \u201cWhatever happens on the plain of my paintings has to take place instantly and has to catch and freeze something.\u201d So he\u2019s freezing these different moments of his process within a single abstract canvas.</p>\n",
