    "description": "<p>In the 16th century, Italian armorers produced spectacular armor garnitures for noblemen, professional officers, and bodyguards in the service of princely courts. An armor garniture consisted of many matching, interchangeable pieces that could be added or removed from basic field armor to make it suitable for different occasions. Like jousting armor, this armor for foot tourneys at the barriers\u2014a sporting event in which knights on foot approached each other on opposite sides of a barrier\u2014is quite specialized. It includes a close helmet that locked onto and rotated on the gorget (collar) and asymmetrical pauldrons (shoulder defenses) that provided maneuverability and protection from thrusting across the barrier. The blemish on the helmet of this armor, just above the eye slit, is the result of a glancing blow. This armor, embellished with gilded radiating bands contrasted with steel bands, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/106187\">Three-Quarter Armor</a>, belonged to the Spanish Marquesses de Dos Aguas.</p>\n",
