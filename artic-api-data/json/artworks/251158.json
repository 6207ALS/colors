    "description": "<p>Frank Lloyd Wright designed three houses for the Jacobses, two of which were built. The first house, known as Usonia #1, was built in 1937 in Madison, Wisconsin; the second house, the &quot;Solar Hemicycle,&quot; was built in 1948 in Middleton, Wisconsin. This collection documents the construction of these houses through correspondence, annotations, newspaper articles, photographs, periodical literature, and drawings. The collection is augmented by photographs of other buildings designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, newspaper articles about Wright's architecture and life, brochures on Taliesin projects and Wright memorabilia: announcements, programs, candid photographs, and Taliesin publications. The collection comprehensively records the design development and construction of Wright's first Usonian residence, an important summation of Wright's theories on the use of materials and space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Jacobs,%20Herbert%20and%20Katherine,%20Residence%20and%20Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20Records/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Jacobs,%20Herbert%20and%20Katherine,%20Residence%20and%20Frank%20Lloyd%20Wright%20Records/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.saic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Wright,%20Frank%20Lloyd/field/creato;%20additi;%20contri/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Find all Frank Lloyd Wright digital images.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
