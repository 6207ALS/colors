    "description": "<p>Robert Overby\u2019s varied work ranges from extensive investigations of materials and process conducted through castings of large-scale architectural elements and fixtures, to intimate casts of everyday objects, geometric prints, and representational paintings. At the same time that Overby introduced concrete into his repertoire of materials, he discovered a form that would hold a special importance for him\u2014the door. The artist explained: \u201cI see the door definitely as a body. . . . But the door\u2019s also something that you set your scale by. It\u2019s also a barrier\u2014I have that kind of peeping Tom mentality you know, wanting to know what\u2019s behind it.\u201d <em>Concrete Screen Door</em> is part of a series of five doors\u2014all screen doors cast in concrete. Playing on the translucency inherent in the original object, the sheer materiality of Overby\u2019s door undermines its utility, thwarting the viewer\u2019s ability to peer through its form.</p>\n",
