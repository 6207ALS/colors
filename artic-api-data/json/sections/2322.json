The painting appears to retain its original stretcher. Matisse first painted a rudimentary brush sketch of the basic composition in thin black outlines. He applied subtle warm glazes over the ground in the area of the compositional background. As a contrast to these tones, he used pale purple to indicate geranium leaves, then painted over them with varied greens using quick directional brushstrokes. The artist heavily worked the paint in the upper half using a layered technique, which belied the rapid brushwork that gives the upper portion of the composition the appearance of a sketch. Over the initial warm glazes, Matisse continued to adjust the color and the atmospheric light. He eliminated the darkly glazed penumbra of the top corners by lightening them with pronounced white scumbles, then added fluid blue strokes on top. In the background he worked back and forth between light and dark blues, producing an animated, shifting quality around the geranium. He highlighted the form of the figurine at right (Woman Leaning on Her Hands [cat. 9]) to suggest a directional light from that side, while he deepened the background tones around the huddled statuette at left (Matisse\u2019s Thorn Extractor [cat. 10]), enveloping it in shade. He used shadows to link other objects on the table to one another. In the terracotta pot Matisse manipulated the paint after it had been applied\u2014wiping back, scraping with a knife, and dry brushing to expose the underlying colors to lend the pot a more worn appearance.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 11.1).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower left, in dilute blue paint) (fig. 11.2 and fig. 11.3). The signature was added over dry paint but before a final layer of green was applied to the tabletop, which overlaps it slightly.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were 100 \u00d7 81 cm. This corresponds to a no. 40 portrait (figure) standard-size (100 \u00d7 73 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Medium weight. Average thread count (standard deviation): 12.5V (0.2) \u00d7 16.5H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe threads are quite thin and somewhat loosely woven. Thread-density maps indicate mild cusping on all four sides, probably the result of stretching onto the original stretcher. The lack of strong cusping at any particular edge suggests that Still Life with Geranium was not cut near an edge of the larger pre-primed canvas piece but instead was cut somewhere in the middle.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1951 lining (see Conservation History). The current dimensions are slightly larger than in the original stretching\u20140.3 cm in the vertical direction and 0.5 cm in the horizontal direction\u2014due to keying out of the stretcher.\n\nOriginal stretching: The placement of the original tacks could not be observed because the edges are covered by paper tape.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current six-member stretcher may be original to the painting. When the canvas was lined in 1951, the restorer repaired and retained the stretcher (see Conservation History). Dimensions: width, 5.8 cm; depth, 1.5 cm (fig. 11.4).\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nA cross-section shows a brownish organic sizing layer below the ground that has a strong blue fluorescence in ultraviolet light (possibly glue) (fig. 11.5).\n\nPre-primed with ground layers extending on all four sides. Cross-sectional analysis revealed two layers of ground: the top layer is much thinner (15\u201355 \u03bcm) and the bottom layer is thicker (44\u2013122 \u03bcm) (fig. 11.6). The lower layer contains many warm pigment particles, creating a yellowish-beige tone (fig. 11.7). The ground appears to have been applied by large sweeps of a brush, and the brushmarks are sometimes visible on the surface of the painting (fig. 11.8).\n\nUnpainted ground is left exposed around patches of brushwork. Some areas of seemingly exposed ground are in fact covered by glaze. There is more exposed ground around all the table objects, such as the figurines, which lends them a brightness and more immediate presence.\n\nWhen observed microscopically, the ground appears warm yellowish-white with many small white lumps (fig. 11.9). Although the pigmented particles are primarily in the lower ground, the upper ground is thin and does not mask the warm tone.\n\nFTIR analysis determined the ground to be lead white (basic lead carbonate), barium sulfate, and traces of kaolin in an oil medium. SEM/EDX analysis found that the lower layer is mostly lead white with some barium sulfate, zinc-based white, iron oxide red and orange with associated silicates and traces of ultramarine blue, carbon-based black, silicates, and silica. The top layer is mostly lead white with traces of aluminum silicate, iron oxide, and possibly zinc white.\n\nInfrared examination (0.9\u20131.7 \u03bcm) reveals a rudimentary black painted sketch (fig. 11.10, fig. 11.11). These marks served only as general indications for the placement of elements. Lines to set the position of the terracotta pot, the table edge, and a few geranium stems were not closely followed. The painted sketch lines that loosely indicated the position of the two figurines are still visible under the final contour lines, as are the two different sets of lines for the jug\u2019s handle.\n\nThe sketch was executed in a black paint (estimated to be oil).\n\nMatisse made only a few changes as the sketch developed: the shift in the jug handle and the adjustments in the figurines are still visible (fig. 11.12). Infrared examination reveals lines around the figurine at left, suggesting that it originally may have been farther to the left (fig. 11.13). A line for the lower right edge of the terracotta pot lies farther to the right than the painted edge. A sketched leaf to the right of the top flower was not used (fig. 11.14).\n\nMatisse first painted the preliminary sketch, then laid extremely thin glazes of subtle, shifting color over the background area, with a darker color in the top corners. Underneath the top paint layers, a pale-orange tone of the glaze in the upper right shifts to a lightly applied brown, and becomes more yellow below and toward the left (fig. 11.15 and fig. 11.16). With these thin wash-like glazes, the artist created a sense of light and atmosphere for the geranium. Matisse began blocking in the geranium leaves using subtle pale-purple strokes (fig. 11.17). On the right side, he blocked around the edges of these leaves with violet strokes to set the pale plant against a darker background (fig. 11.18). He then reworked the leaves in green, painting them with direct brushy patches, using a range of unmodulated shades of green, from dark olive to yellow-green. The leaves only loosely follow the pale purple lay-in, which only loosely followed the sketch. More leaves were then added to fill in the plant. The artist applied additional layers of paint to some leaves, making them more opaque, changing the color, or enlivening them with yellow highlights, pink flowers, and red buds, most often working quickly and wet-in-wet (fig. 11.19).\n\nIn the top corners, Matisse painted white to lighten the initial orange and brown glazes and enclosing penumbra with bright light from above. To reintegrate these white patches, he added fluid strokes of blue (left) and turquoise (right), which are thin enough that the luminosity of the white is still visible (fig. 11.20 and fig. 11.21). He filled in around the plant with different blues, layering and blending them in some areas to bring the tones closer together and soften their brushwork (fig. 11.22). Thus, the blues have been worked to lessen their contrast, while the geranium leaves stand out because of their contrast and variety. The artist gave the blue atmosphere around the plant a sense of depth, as the lighter blues seem to envelop the geranium from the front and the dark blues from behind, so that space and form interpenetrate. This process exemplifies the subtlety of Matisse\u2019s adjustments. In the lower background Matisse made color changes that suggest a directional light from the right. He blocked out the previous violet, brown, yellow and green glazes with very pale pink and blue scumbles (fig. 11.23). He reinforced the sense of light on this side by adding strokes of strong highlight and shadow on the arms of the figurine at right (fig. 11.24). Conversely, Matisse darkened the blocks of violet, pale purple, and pink surrounding the figurine at left (fig. 11.25).\n\nThe tabletop was laid in with a variety of washes in earthy shades of green, brown, purple, and pink, shifting from darker and more opaque in the back to transparently brighter toward the front and right. The objects on the table were laced together with dark shadows, while occasional pale-highlight strokes separate the forms.\n\nIn some areas, Matisse manipulated the paint after it had been applied with various tools. Wiping, dry brushing, scraping, and gouging were used on the geranium pot, which lend the surface the worn, moldy, porous appearance of aged terracotta (fig. 11.26). This container was first laid in with brown, dark green, and olive green. Before the greens had dried, the artist painted over them with varied pinks, and while still wet, the pink of the pot\u2019s middle section was dry brushed, which lightly removed the wet paint in visible strokes to reveal the green below (fig. 11.27). The pink on the left side has been lightly wiped, exposing the tops of the wrinkled olive-green paint underneath (fig. 11.28). On the right side there is a V-shaped gouge through the wet paint, and the surface appears lightly scraped (fig. 11.29).\n\nBrushes, primarily medium width. Various tools and techniques were used to manipulate the paint surface: wiping (probably with a cloth), dry brushing, scraping, and gouging (probably with a palette knife).\n\nPurples, pinks, reds, and violets played a stronger role in the earlier stages of the painting process, and blues and additional greens during the later stages. Matisse made many color changes (see Paint Layer). Eventually Matisse used all the primary and secondary colors in varied tones and tints: green, blue, red, orange, purple, and yellow (in descending order), as well as brown, black, and white. Dilute glazes of pale orange, yellow, brown, pink, lavender, blue, and turquoise were also used.\n\nOil (estimated). Matisse added extra medium for areas of very fluid paint, as in the small geranium sprout (fig. 11.30).The thin shadow below the left onion appears highly diluted with turpentine (fig. 11.31). The fluidity and thinness of the blue paint covering the white scumbles in the top corners suggests that the paint contained a large amount of both medium and turpentine.\n\nThe painting is presently unvarnished. A natural-resin varnish was applied at an unknown date and was removed in 2008. This varnish was not original. Both abrasion of the paint in some spots and a very heavy layer of grime underneath the varnish indicate that the picture probably remained unvarnished for some time after it was painted.\n\nAcquired in 1932, the earliest treatment recorded in the conservation object file is from February 1951, when the painting was cleaned and lined with an aqueous adhesive, and the stretcher repaired, by an outside conservator. Paste or glue remnants from a facing were found on top of the natural-resin varnish, suggesting that it was cleaned and revarnished before it was lined. This cleaning, or a previous one, caused abrasion to the thin paint and glaze layers, particularly on the tops of the threads, leaving mottled, grime-covered paint in the interstices. This abrasion occurred in a large area of the top right corner and down the right side of the background. Some losses, primarily along the top and right edges, had been retouched before the varnish was applied but had become ill matched. The tension of the facing adhesive layer on the varnish surface caused numerous areas of fragile lifting paint and tiny paint losses as the adhesive contracted.\n\nIn 2005, the lifting paint was consolidated, and the facing adhesive residue on the surface was removed.\n\nIn 2008, the picture was cleaned, removing the yellowed natural-resin varnish, discolored repaint, and the underlying grime. Losses and the abrasion occurring during the earlier treatment were filled and retouched. The surface was not revarnished.\n\nThe painting is in good condition, except where the top paint and glaze layers were partially abraded in an earlier treatment in the top right corner (extending down almost to the leaves) and along the right edge of the background. These areas have now been inpainted to recover the artist\u2019s brushwork and tonalities, matching the colors still present in the interstices, between the abraded highpoints, as a guide. The aqueous lining has not significantly affected the appearance of the painting. The paint and ground layer remain very fragile and generally are not well adhered to the canvas. There have been numerous pinhole-size losses (fig. 11.32). Lifting paint on a microscopic scale is a recurring problem requiring consolidation.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, twenty-first-century, gilt, molding frame with an ovolo face. The pine molding has oil gilding with a pigmented glue size, applied over flat black oil paint on the dark-brown-stained pine. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is straight outer side and ovolo (fig. 11.33).\n\nPrevious frame (installed 1991; removed 2009): The painting was previously housed in an American (New York), twentieth-century reproduction of a Spanish Baroque, seventeenth-century, architrave frame gilded with stylized [glossary:c-scroll] foliate [glossary:cartouches]. The frame had water gilding on red bole over gesso with a toned varnish layer. The jelutong moldings were carved and mitered and nailed at the corner miters to a basswood back frame glued and nailed to the verso. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ovolo with bead; scotia with stylized c-scroll foliate cartouches at the miter; and torus with ovulos rodeaos (egg surrounds) at the sight edge (fig. 11.34).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1950; removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously housed in a gilded scotia molding frame with an [glossasry:ogee] sight molding (fig. 11.35).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Mar. 1, 1907\u2013Oct. 27, 1908.\n\nSold to Oskar (July 21, 1875\u2013Aug. 19, 1947) and Greta (1884\u20131977) Moll, Breslau, Germany (present-day Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), from Oct. 27, 1908.\n\nFrederick Clay Bartlett (1873\u20131953), Chicago, by Mar. 6, 1929\u2013Dec. 27, 1932.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 27, 1932.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Berlin, Paul Cassirer, X.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1932.1342\\_Matisse\\_Geranium\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 18, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBased on marks indicating where the canvas was folded over the edge when the picture was painted. See, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThe sculptures in the painting are life size; this may have been a determining factor in the artist\u2019s choice of canvas size.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Henri Matisse The Geranium (1932.1342),\u201d Mar. 2009.

Butler, and Claudine Grammont, and technical contributions by Barbara A. Buckley, Jennifer Mass, and Thomas Primeau (Barnes Foundation, 2015).\n\nThe possibility of the presence of lithopone white (a mixture of barium sulfate and zinc sulfide) in the lower ground cannot be ruled out, although additional analysis would be needed to confirm this.

A relationship between the two paintings is further suggested by the writings of Roland Schacht (1922), who recalls a still life with a geranium by Matisse at Cassirer in the artist\u2019s \u201cersten Ausstellung in Deutschland\u201d (pp. 11, 15). However, it is unclear whether Schacht is referring to the appearance of Geranium in this solo exhibition or the group show that occurred Sept. 30\u2013Oct. 18, 1907.
