    "description": "<p>This wooden mask, which would have been worn over the head like a helmet, is a superb example of an art form that is found almost exclusively among the Egbado, a subgroup inhabiting the northwestern part of Yourubaland. A <em>gelede</em> is a festival of masks performed in veneration of the society\u2019s powerful older women, the <em>iyami</em>. Egbado Yoruba communities perform <em>gelede</em> annually, at which time they formally recognize the powers of the <em>iyami</em>, and solicit their benevolence to ensure the prosperity of the community.<br>This mask is typical of what Western museums and galleries display to represent <em>gelede</em>. The actual festival involves street orchestras, a lavish display of wooden and cloth costumes, dance, music, singing, and drama that are designed to entertain the viewers, who are also integrated into the performances. The wooden helmet at the top of the masked dancer\u2019s head is part of a large, mixed-media ensemble, including fabric, beads, seeds, and bones, as well as other sculptural pieces attached to various parts of the masked dancer\u2019s body. This <em>gelede</em> mask represents the outsider, who can be a foreigner or a Yoruba who does not adhere to the cultural norm. Outsider status is indicated by the oblique facial mark across the nose, called <em>baamu</em>. The headgear resembles a stylish type of hat, with two overhanging flaps, called <em>abetiaja</em>, meaning the ears of a dog. These flaps may also represent the wings of birds, which the Yoruba associate with women. The calm look on the mask reflects the cool character of elderly females, who are thought to conceal their power under a cloak of humility, patience, care, and obliviousness.</p>\n<p>\u2014Revised from, Moyo Okediji, \u201cArt of the Yoruba,\u201d <em>African Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, Museum Studies</em> 23, no. 2 (1997), pp. 172-174.</p>\n",
