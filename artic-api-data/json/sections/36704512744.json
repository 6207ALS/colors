Harrison Collection, 1933.888\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Caricature of L\u00e9on Manchon was drawn in charcoal on blue laid paper. The slightly toothy surface of the sheet captured the charcoal, allowing the artist to create rich, velvety passages in the figure's head. White chalk was used along the front of the face to establish highlights, and the blue tonality of the paper establishes a middle value in the composition. There is selective stumping in the nose, chin, eyes, and side of the face that creates shading and modeling in the head (fig. 2.1). Stumping also appears to have been used in the figure\u2019s coat for tonal variation. The background elements are defined with fine charcoal lines.\n\nC. Monet (recto, bottom left, in black chalk).\n\nBlue (discolored to yellowish gray), moderately thick, slightly textured laid paper.\n\nMFDT, vertical, lower center.\n\nHorizontal, 28\u201329 mm\n\n90\u2013100 mm\n\nIvory, dark-blue, medium-blue, and red fibers.\n\nSlightly uneven; in transmitted illumination, the paper is thicker at the center left, top, and bottom.\n\nThe left and top edges are cut straight. There is a deckle edge at the right and bottom.\n\n612 \u00d7 452 mm\n\nThere are no artistic surface alterations or coatings visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the recto of the paper that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nCharcoal was used to create the image overall. There is selective stumping in the nose, chin, eyes, and side of the face that create shading and modeling in the head. Stumping also appears to have been used in the figure\u2019s coat for tonal variation. Passages of white chalk along the front of the face establish highlights.\n\nThere is no drawing media on the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes, other than intended experimentation with coloring, are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible under normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe paper has discolored to a yellowish gray in the image area due to excessive light exposure through a former window-mat opening. There are also light-reddish-brown foxing spots throughout. Undulations are visible overall within the image, which are most pronounced at the top corners. Moderate deformation of the paper sheet is visible around the perimeter, corresponding to an approximately four-centimeter-wide band of adhesive residue around the perimeter on the verso of the sheet; this adhesive reemits a bright-yellowish-white visible-light fluorescence under UV illumination. A small area of this adhesive is also visible at the center top edge on the recto. The undulations and the deformation are likely the result of a former mounting. There are numerous losses and tears around the edges that may have occurred during removal from the former mount; the largest losses, with associated skinning, are visible at the center top and center bottom edges. The deckle edge along the right and bottom is darkened due to penetration of the adhesive into the paper.\n\nThere is a scratch across the figure\u2019s proper left eye that removed some of the charcoal media. Some light transfer of media is visible overall.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.
