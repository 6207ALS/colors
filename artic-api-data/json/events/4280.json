    "description": "<p>Richly decorated with frescoes and mosaics, Roman villas provide an ideal context for considering the role of art in the relationships between the ancient Roman elite and their slaves. Join Lea K. Cline, associate professor of art history, Illinois State University, as she examines one Roman villa (Villa A at Oplontis, near ancient Pompeii, Italy) from the perspective of its slave occupants, exploring the dynamic relationships that existed in the context of a working villa and challenging the idea that these spaces had one function and one audience.</p><p>Presented by the Classical Art Society</p><p>For more information, call (312) 443-3697 or email <a href=\"mailto:CAS@artic.edu\"><strong>CAS@artic.edu</strong></a>.</p>",
