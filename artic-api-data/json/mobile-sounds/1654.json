    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: For me, this porcelain incense burner is wonderfully playful and embodies the aesthetic refinement and technical sophistication of the Northern Song dynasty, which ruled China from the late 10th to the early 12th century A.D.  This incense burner is shaped like a duck sitting on an open lotus flower.  It was probably made for a scholar, artist, government official or wealthy merchant, someone who would have appreciated its elegance as well as its function.  Incense was highly prized at that time.  It was thought to dispel gloom, induce a meditative state, and enhance creativity.  The fragrant smoke would have wafted from the duck's mouth and from the two holes beneath its feet, though you can see only one of those holes here.  Among the triumphs of the ceramicist's technique are the fine white porcelain body, subtle bluish-white glaze, and the articulation of feathers on the wings and tail, which catch the light and give life to the form.  This remarkable object came to the Art Institute from Russell Tyson.  Born in Shanghai in 1867, Tyson eventually moved to Chicago, where he became one of the city's most astute collectors of Asian art.  His passion led him to found the Orientals, a social outlet for both scholars and collectors, which features seminars, lectures, and concerts.  Many in the group, including Kate Buckingham, laid the foundation for the museum's world-class collection of Asian art.</p>\n",
