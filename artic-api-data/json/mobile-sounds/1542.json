    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the center of this painting the Virgin Mary tenderly holds the Christ Child, as the infant John the Baptist leans into her lap. Peter Paul Rubens made the painting around 1615, skillfully transforming a traditional religious subject into a family scene, full of life and warmth. Marth Wolff, Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European Painting before 1750.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: The studies of the children are beautifully worked out. Especially the Christ Child, with his sort of sidelong glance as he's involved with his mother, and yet also looking down at his little cousin. And these figures are very probably drawn from his own experience of his own large family.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Rubens' rich colors add to the painting's liveliness. Notice how he contrasts the rosy creaminess of the baby's skin, with delicate blue-tone shadows. And Christ's stomach glows with the reflection of his mother's red dress, which Rubens has modeled on a fashionable style of his own time. But the painting also contains solemn reminders of Christ's momentous destiny. The lamb, petted by Mary's husband Joseph, symbolizes Christ's future sacrifice for the sake of mankind, while the clouds outside hint at dark shadows to come.</p>\n",
