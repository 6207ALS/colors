From the layout of the composition it appears that he worked out the figure with light, quick strokes of graphite, followed by darker, broader lines to more fully establish the form. Horizontal and diagonal lines were selectively used to create shadows in the body of the figure and darker values in the hair and pants. Monet added several dots of graphite throughout the drawing, particularly in the head of the figure. It is unclear whether this was intentional.\n\nClaude Monet (recto, center top edge, in graphite).\n\nIvory (discolored to tan), very thick, slightly textured wove card.\n\nUniform with few fiber inclusions.\n\nEven.\n\nThe corners are all rounded.\n\n203 \u00d7 166 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using the fine point of a soft graphite to establish the profile of the figure\u2019s face. Tonal effects were created using the side of the graphite in a back-and-forth motion. The point of the graphite was then used to further define the figure\u2019s outline and to establish details. There are many small dots throughout the figure\u2019s head and body and the desk. It appears that Monet jabbed the graphite into the support in quick, up-and-down movements to create these dots. This type of application of the graphite creates a unique line similar to an engraving line, the bluntness of which tapers at the end. It is unclear whether this was the artist\u2019s intention or an inadvertent application of media. The desk and the vessels on it were minimally modeled using the side of the graphite to create both broad, thick linear marks and faint, back-and-forth strokes. There is minor smudging near areas of dense application of media. This appears to be offset rather than a result of the artist intentionally smudging the graphite to create tone.\n\nOn the verso there is a faint profile of a man\u2019s face in graphite (fig. 7.1). It appears to be very similar to the drawing of the man on the recto.\n\nThe composition was drawn directly onto the paper support. There is minor reworking on the figure\u2019s forehead and the proper right hand and sleeve (fig. 7.2).\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. There is a moderate accumulation of surface soiling and discoloration overall. There are many faint brown foxing spots throughout the card. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, the foxing spots on the recto fluoresce yellow. There are two light-brown water-type stains near the top corners. The edges of the card have lifting paper fibers along with minor fiber abrasions. There are several pinholes throughout the card. One pinhole is located at the center of the top edge along with a pinhole that pierced the verso but did not puncture the other side. One of the pinholes penetrates the tip of the M in the signature. The pinholes near the upper left corner and near the center of the right edge have rust deposits inside the holes. There are two small dents approximately 37 mm from the upper edge and 36 mm from the right edge. Another two similar type dents are located at the lower right corner, approximately 37 mm from the bottom and right edges. The left edge has a small dent at each corner, approximately 35 mm from the top and bottom edges and 35 mm in from the left edge. Dents at the fours corners perhaps indicate the artist\u2019s method of holding down the card while he was drawing. There is a small cluster of dents near the base of the neck. Gray areas at the bottom corners are excess adhesive. There is a small area of paper abrasion at the bottom left corner. On the verso, there is a faint accumulation of surface dirt, and the edges of the paper support are moderately discolored. There are a few golden-yellow foxing spots throughout the card. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, the foxing spots on the verso fluoresce white. Along all edges residual water-soluble adhesive and remnants of green paper are visible. There are several old, white paper hinges at the four corners and at the center of the left and right edges.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D497 (ill.) and p. 144, cat. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
