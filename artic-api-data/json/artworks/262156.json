    "description": "<p>The Michael and Jane Bizzarri house, completed in 1959 in Cleveland, Ohio, was designed by architect Richard J. Neutra (1892-1970), a Modernist known for such buildings as the Kaufmann Desert House in Palm Springs, California, and the Lincoln Memorial Museum in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which display his desire to find harmony between architecture and nature. Included in these papers are correspondence, publications, photographs, and architectural drawings, which document aspects of the design and construction of the Bizzarri house as well as the friendship that developed between the Bizzarri and Neutra families as a result of the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Bizzarri,%20Michael%20and%20Jane,%20House%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Bizzarri,%20Michael%20and%20Jane,%20House%20Papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
