    "transcript": "<p>Nichole Bridges:</p>\n<p>My name is Nichole Bridges. I am curator of African Art at the Saint Louis Art Museum. What we're looking at is a figure sculpture made of ivory, and what we're seeing is a kneeling figure that below the shoulders, it appears to be a human figure kneeling with its hands posed on its belly. Then as we look up, we see a head in a very dramatic-looking animal form. It was the decorative handle of a staff. This is something that a powerful individual of great status would've carried, and he might have carried it in when meeting with other dignitaries or traders and other social contacts where his position, where he really needed to emphasize his position of status and power. The Congo Kingdom, which Europeans first encountered at the end of the 15th century, the Congo Kingdom, by this point, was really in disarray, and it wasn't really traditional rulers anymore who had great power and importance.</p>\n<p>It was people who had importance due to wealth and access to foreigners and to trade goods, and wealth really gained through commerce rather than through tradition or traditional noble descent or something like that. A local chief who might have owned this staff, he likely controlled access to ivory and played a critical role in negotiating the trade of this material, the exchange of this material with foreigners. By carrying a staff like this made of ivory, he's really emphasizing his role as one of the principal controllers of this great source, this natural resource being exported from Africa in exchange for great wealth in return.</p>\n",
