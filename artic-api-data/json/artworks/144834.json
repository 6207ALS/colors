    "description": "<p>In July 1950, <em>Vogue</em> magazine sent Irving Penn to Paris to document that year\u2019s fall couture collections. Over the course of ten days, clothes by Balenciaga, Dior, Rochas, and others were rushed to an old top-floor studio, where Penn posed models against a discarded theater curtain. The resulting photographs, spread across two September issues, marked a stark departure from the elaborately staged sets favored by fashion photographers of the previous decade. Among the models, Lisa Fonssagrives was a standout\u2014in 1949, at age 38, she had become the first model to grace the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine, earning the title \u201cBillion-Dollar Baby.\u201d The statuesque icon first captured Penn\u2019s attention at a 1947 photo shoot, and in the years that followed she became his muse and collaborator. Just a few weeks after this photograph was taken the two were married.</p>\n",
