    "description": "<p>\u201cFor me, painting the crosses was a way of painting the country,\u201d recalled Georgia O\u2019Keeffe about the series of compositions featuring Catholic crosses that she created upon visiting the Southwest in 1929. In <em>Black Cross, New Mexico</em>, she contrasted the handmade cross, magnified in scale and isolated flat against the picture plane, with the distant brilliance of the sunset behind the rolling hills. O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s cross paintings helped cement her association with New Mexico, to which she would return every summer until she moved there permanently in 1949. The Art Institute organized her first major museum retrospective in 1943, and purchased this painting at the time.</p>\n",
