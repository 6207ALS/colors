    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Claude Monet painted this picture of his future wife, Camille Doncieux sitting on a bank of the river Seine outside Paris. They were staying with their baby in the village of Bennecourt, seen across the river. Monet was then in his late twenties and not yet widely known as an artist. But he was already making highly experimental paintings with new kinds of themes taken from modern life, such as this one. Monet\u2019s technique was also extremely radical. The painting is built up with broad, unblended brushstrokes. Contemporary viewers were used to paintings that aim to mirror reality, with a smooth traditional paint surface. To them Monet\u2019s approach seemed shockingly unfinished and illegible. If we look closely at Camille\u2019s skirt, for example, it is hard to tell where it ends and the grass beings. But Monet\u2019s dynamic technique also gives the scene a feeling of spontaneity, as if he has truly captured a fleeting moment in this calm sun filled afternoon. Rectangles of brown and white in the river suggest reflections of the buildings and clouds, and on the foreground bank dashes of yellow represent flowers, fragile enough to move in the slightest breeze.</p>\n",
