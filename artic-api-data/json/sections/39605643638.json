While numerous publications cite Roy as the sole printer of the edition, it is this authors\u2019 opinion that the production of the Roy impressions\u2014as sheets from the edition are known\u2014was a collaboration and not a commission and that the two men exchanged ideas about media, methods for inking blocks, paper type, and the use of stencils. Perhaps Roy had access to a small press where he could print the blocks in more significant numbers than could quickly and easily be produced by hand. However, Roy could not have independently determined how to manipulate the ink to achieve Gauguin\u2019s desired effects, nor could he have known the degree to which the artist wished for the various ink layers to differ both in their surface texture and in their registration. No two Roy impressions are exactly alike. The inks were manipulated in several ways: in some impressions close visual examination reveals that their composition was altered with additives that made the inks bulkier and more dimensional; in others, the consistency of the ink rolled onto the block was made more or less viscous, and in many, the loaded ink roller was passed over the block more than once. In some of the prints, the ink was applied with a dry brush, perhaps a stencil brush, as well as a roller. In all of the prints, one or more stencils were used to position and isolate various zones of color on a tone block or on the paper itself. Ultimately, the two collaborators did not succeed in producing a standard, visually uniform edition. Instead, they printed a group that is visually engaging in its own right, and quite distinct from Gauguin\u2019s solo experiments with printing his wood blocks.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 59.4.2).\n\nTo create this impression, a tone block was printed in chrome yellow ink, over which a stencil was used to brush apply a vermilion red tone directly to the paper with a stencil brush, followed by the uneven printing of the image in carbon black ink (see fig. 59.4.3). The yellow and black inks were each applied with a roller onto their respective blocks. The underlying paper tone appears everywhere the brush-applied red tone appears (fig. 59.4.4). Two separate stencils were used. The first stencil, used in conjunction with the tone block, demarcated chrome yellow passages that extend across the sheet from upper left to lower right. In raking light the outline of the stencil is clearly visible where there is a change in the surface gloss of the media that underlie the black printing ink. The second stencil was used to position and deliberately misalign the areas where red ink was applied with a stencil brush adjacent to the yellow ink (fig. 59.4.5 and see fig. 59.4.6). The consistency of the red ink (a mixture of vermilion and an iron oxide [likely hematite]) is more fluid than the roller-applied printing inks. Its irregular surface texture, with peaks and valleys visible under magnification, is the result of the amount of solvent added to the ink to obtain the consistency required to achieve this effect. This is the same ink used in the production of the Art Institute\u2019s other Roy impression of Auti te pape (cat. 59.3), only it is used in a more dilute consistency and applied in a stippled manner with a dry brush.\n\nThe stencils were used repeatedly throughout production of the edition, said to number twenty-five to thirty impressions. This is confirmed by examination of a large number of prints, which determined that the shapes of the forms, their dimensions and their distance from each other is nearly identical in all of them. The only variable is the position of the stencil. With substantial borders of paper around the printed image, the positioning of the image 3 mm up and 4 mm to the right of the underlying yellow tone and red stenciling is readily apparent. Registration was jettisoned in favor of a deliberate, and random, skewing of the printings, as Gauguin had done in so many of the impressions that he had previously printed on his own.\n\nGauguin and Roy selected a paper for their collaborative printing of the Noa Noa Suitet hat was a sturdy, medium-weight paper commonly used for printing at the time. The paper is of Western manufacture, although its weight and smooth surface are reminiscent of the fine-quality Japanese vellum papers that were so coveted by artists and printers at the time. While the Japanese precursors upon which the imitation vellums were modeled were made with the finest Japanese paper fibers, their Western counterparts were manufactured with a large proportion of acidic wood-pulp fibers and a great deal of sizing, making them more affordable for mass distribution. The inclusion of wood pulp, however, made it impossible for Western papermakers to reproduce the lustrous surface quality of the Japanese papers. The addition of wood pulp also made the imitation vellums more susceptible to color change with exposure to light. While the inclusion of large quantities of sizing in the paper helped to produce the hard, smooth, sturdy surfaces characteristic of imitation vellums, which were robust enough for printing wood blocks, the papers absorbed the printing inks less readily. As a result, the inks sit high on the surface of the paper. This gives the Roy impressions a flat, bold, graphic appearance overall, one that is unmistakable in print production of the nineteenth century.\n\n208 \u00d7 377 mm (image); 250 \u00d7 397 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. The sheet exhibits pronounced creasing. None of the ink was deposited into the overlapping folds, which indicates that the creases were present before printing commenced (fig. 59.4.7). This is confirmed by examination of the sheet under magnification. There is ink offset on the verso, probably from contact with another impression in a drying stack (fig. 59.4.1). The sheet was lightly humidified in 2002 to reduce distortion from the creasing.  \nHarriet K.

It is clear from examination of numerous impressions that the collaborators were unable to produce a standardized edition for sale since there is great variation among them. A set within a portfolio similar to that produced for Pola Gauguin\u2019s posthumous printing has never been identified. It is known that Roy was among the group of artists involved in the production of the Catalogue de l\u2019Exposition de peintures du groupe impressionniste et synth\u00e9tiste in 1889 and the exhibition to which it relates (see cat. 22).\n\nThis comment is based on study of the prints. In some impressions the inks that were used emulate the dimensionality of the oil-based media that Gauguin used in his impressions, and the manner in which the stencils and blocks were skewed for printing also emulates the artist\u2019s practice. It is possible that Roy recommended the paper type they used since it is one that had not appeared in Gauguin\u2019s graphic production until this moment.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Roy impressions from the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe pigments in the printing inks were identified by XRF and macro-XRF in this impression as well as in Mahna no varua ino (cat. 57.2), and in another impression of Auti te pape (cat. 59.3).
