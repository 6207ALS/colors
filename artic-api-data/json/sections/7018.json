Among the \u201cvaluable recipes\u201d included in the Ladies\u2019 Indispensible Assistant (1850) was an extensive selection of broths, stocks, chowders, and soups made of cabbage, chicken, lobster, oyster, turtle, veal, mutton, and beef. Soup was also viewed as a safe alternative for people suffering from infirmities. In their Christian lifestyle guide, The American Woman\u2019s Home (1869), Catherine Beecher and Harriet Beecher Stowe recommended soups to counter digestive distresses, describing them as \u201cimmediately absorbed and carried into the blood.\u201d The sisters lectured that \u201cliquid nourishment, more speedily than solid food, restores from exhaustion.\u201d\n\nMerchant-class Americans embraced the tureen as both fashionable tableware and the container of choice for the evolving cuisine of the time. As a vessel for warm and savory liquids, the boat-shaped receptacle made sense. Having evolved from symbolic early nineteenth-century presentation pieces to an embodiment of social aspirations and knowledge of etiquette, silver tureens sat on mid-nineteenth-century dining tables outfitted with the requisite porcelain dishware and silver flatware. The owner of a silver tureen such as this example, whether purchased or received as a gift, was presumed to understand the rules of polite social dining.\n\nThis tureen is decorated with repouss\u00e9 chased flowers arranged in sinuous arabesques across its boatlike body, domed cover, and scalloped-and-scrolled pedestal base\u2014all features of American Rococo Revival decoration. Although the style celebrated the naturalistic, curled, and scrolled forms and ornament initially introduced in France during the early eighteenth century, interest in flowing foliate and floral patterns was reignited during the 1840s. The revival style spread during the 1850s through events such as the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations in London and the restoration of France\u2019s Second Empire. Rococo-style designs, including such forms as ceramic and metal tureens, abounded at the Great Exhibition and received widespread press coverage on both sides of the Atlantic. In the United States, interpretations of hourglass and scrolling foliate motifs reflected awareness of fashionable French d\u00e9cor and English luxury goods. Perceived as at once sophisticated, rich, and domestic, these ornate, scrolled, curvaceous, and naturalistic flourishes were worked into a wide array of American furniture, architectural ornament, silver, ironwork, and ceramics.\n\nLocated on the underside of this elaborate vessel are detailed stamps revealing its manufacturer. The unique marks specify that it was made in 1852 by one of New York\u2019s premier silver firms, William Gale &amp; Son, considered to be a \u201cpioneer . . . in the trade.\u201d William Gale established his company in New York City by 1821 and over the course of five decades and seven partnerships manufactured a considerable array of silver hollowware and flatware. Gale\u2019s fifth partnership, with his son, William Gale, Jr., ran from 1850 to 1858 and 1862 to 1866. Like other successful mid-nineteenth-century New York City silversmiths, Gale executed both fanciful and prosaic presentation and domestic hollowware, including Chinese-influenced vessels and flatware, as well as those crafted in the Neoclassical, Empire, Gothic, and Rococo styles.\n\nThis tureen features a more intricate version of the same floral-scroll ornament used by William Gale &amp; Son for the four-hundred-piece tea, coffee, and dinner service presented to Commodore Matthew Perry by the Chamber of Commerce and Merchants of New York (see fig. 48.1). As noted in the New York Times prior to its presentation, the service included \u201csoup tureens, sauce tureens, vegetable dishes, dish covers, butter coolers, a gravy boat, center piece for fruit and flowers, large tea and coffee service, and a full complement of forks, spoons, &amp;c.\u201d Commissioned early in 1855, William Gale &amp; Son had little time to prepare the vast assortment of hollow- and flatware. In all probability assembled from stock, the conservative pattern emulated the Rococo Revival ornament that adorned 1850s American ironwork, interior woodwork, and furniture.\n\nThe engraved coat of arms and motto Deus Dabit, as well as the inscription, S. F. ----- M. G. F. / 1893, offer succinct evidence that by 1893 the tureen was owned by New Yorker Stuyvesant Fish (1851\u20131923) and his wife, Marian Graves Anthon Fish (1853\u20131915). Fish was a son of Hamilton Fish (1808\u20131893), a former New York State governor, U.S. congressman, senator, and secretary of state. The younger Fish made his fortune as a banker and officer of the Illinois Central Railroad. His wife, known as Mamie, was a doyenne of New York and Newport society known for throwing lavish balls. Given the date of the tureen\u2019s manufacture, it is possible that it first belonged to Hamilton Fish and was given to the couple upon his death in 1893. Stuyvesant Fish and his brothers were the executors of their father\u2019s will, although no specific instructions for the disposition of the tureen were included. Given Stuyvesant Fish\u2019s involvement in the Illinois Central Railroad, it is fitting that the tureen now resides in Chicago.  \nDebra Schmidt Bach\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom (fig. 48.2)\n\nEngraved under one handle: S.
