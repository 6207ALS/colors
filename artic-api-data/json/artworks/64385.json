Behind him, pedestrians and vehicles stream past, rendered by the artist in a swirling, modernist array of circles and fractured planes. The figure\u2019s immobile posture and his isolation from the frenetic activity suggest his resistance to\u2014and perseverance amid\u2014a changing world.</p>\n",
