    "description": "<p>Hungarian-born Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz had been living in Paris for less than a year when he visited the studio of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. <em>Mondrian\u2019s Eyeglasses and Pipe</em> is one of a group of beautiful still lifes that the photographer took that day. Within the austere clarity of these simple geometric forms\u2014common manufactured items that Mondrian used daily\u2014Kert\u00e9sz captured the essence of this master of abstraction, both his aspirations to order and his slight and human divergences from it. The insistent angularity of the stark white table is offset by the sculptural curves of the glasses, bowl, and pipe, curves that were rigorously excluded from Mondrian\u2019s art. Throughout Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s long career, he sought the revelation of the found still life, of an abstract or resonating image discovered in an elliptical view. His signature practice of snaring and fixing these lyrical perceptions was facilitated by his later use of light, portable handheld cameras that enabled him to remain mobile and agile even when making still lifes. Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s work significantly influenced that of his contemporaries Brassa\u00ef and Henri Cartier-Bresson.</p>\n",
