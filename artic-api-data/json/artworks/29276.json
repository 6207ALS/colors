    "description": "<p>An artist who worked in many media, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy was hired to lead Chicago\u2019s New Bauhaus, a school based on Bauhaus principles, in 1937. Photography was only one part of a curriculum that integrated art, industry, and society, but it was a key element; as Moholy wrote, \u201cThe illiterate of the future will be ignorant of the camera and the pen alike.\u201d Central to his understanding of photography was the photogram, an image made by placing objects or casting shadows directly on photographic paper and exposing the arrangement to light. To Moholy, the photogram was the perfect teaching tool because it demonstrated the medium\u2019s complete tonal range and revealed photography\u2019s essence to be its sensitivity to light. This image, dedicated to George Barford, another instructor at the school, may have been a collaborative effort in the darkroom or a teaching example for the classroom.</p>\n",
