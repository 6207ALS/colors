A.D. 284\u2013305) beat out his rivals for the position of emperor in A.D. 284, he knew he had to make some changes in order for Rome\u2014badly battered after a half-century of civil war and invasion\u2014to survive. No longer could a single emperor rule from Rome. From 286 Diocletian shared the government and defense of the state with a \u201ccaesar,\u201d a junior partner, Maximian\u2014not really a novelty, since many emperors had associated their successors in their rule. But in 293 he made a gamble: both he and Maximian would carry the title Augustus, while two more officers would be appointed as caesars. With an augustus and caesar in the East and another pair in the West, usurpers and barbarians could be kept in control\u2014or so he hoped. In order to maintain the upper hand, Diocletian would retain the title Jovius that he had adopted in 286, while Maximian would still be Herculius. Thus the Tetrarchy was formed. It did not survive past his reign, but it and other reforms did buy the empire some much-needed time. The \u201cthundering Jupiter\u201d on the reverse is shown destroying one of the fin-footed Giants who tried to destroy Olympus. Diocletian was definitely battling gigantic foes: invasions, civil strife, an uncontrollable military, and devastating inflation among them.\n\nThe currency reforms of Diocletian began in 293 with the restoration of the aureus to 60 aurei to the Roman pound, or about 5.34 grams; our coin falls comfortably within the target weight. This had some effect on slowing inflation. The mint mark PT identifies the mint as Trier (Latin: Treveri).  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Diocletianus Pius (\u201cdutiful\u201d) Felix (\u201chappy\u201d) Augustus.\n\nMattingly, \u201cJovius and Herculius,\u201d p. 131.\n\nIt had fallen badly since Aurelian\u2019s reforms of c. 272: see cat. 67, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Aurelian; Estiot, \u201cLater Third Century\u201d; Harl, Coinage in the Roman Economy, pp. 149\u201352.\n\nSee also cat. 70, Argenteus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Diocletian.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 69 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Diocletian, A.D. 294/305\n\n</section>",
