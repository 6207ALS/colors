The artworks survey Picasso\u2019s extensive material experimentations, and subjects that are emblematic of the artist, including the emotive individuals of his Blue and Rose periods, the faceted faces and still-life objects of his Cubist years, and the monumental personages from his post-World War II production. An illustrated chronology documents notable exhibitions and acquisitions and outlines Picasso\u2019s varied contributions to a city that has enthusiastically collected his art for the past century.
