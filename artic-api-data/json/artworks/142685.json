    "description": "<p>As powerful vehicles for propaganda, Byzantine coins also emphasized the close relationship between earthly monarchs and the heavenly realm, as does this solidus of Theophilus (r. 829-842). A bust-length portrait of the emperor appears on the obverse; he wears a crown and is garbed in the imperial loros, a heavily jeweled stole for festive occasions. In his hands are a globe and a scepter, both of which are surmounted by crosses. The patriarchal cross above three steps that appears on the reverse is meant to represent a large cross that was erected in the fourth century on the site of Christ's crucifixion in Jerusalem. This motif of a cross and steps was first used on the coins of Tiberius II (r. 578-82), and its increasing popularity reflected the progressive Christianizing of imperial iconography, in which symbols such as the cross replaced earlier pagan elements like winged Victories.</p>\n<p>The imagery of Byzantine coins, as well as their use\u2014or not\u2014of religious imagery, reflects the different attitudes toward representation of divine figures as a result of the Iconoclastic (from the Greek eikon, or image, and klao, to break) Controversy, a fierce debate among Byzantine theologians over the appropriate role of images in religious worship that raged in Byzantium for over 100 years from about 730 to 843.<br>Theophilus, the last imperial proponent of Iconoclasm, follows the examples of Heraclius (r. 610\u201341) and Leontius (r. 695\u201398) before him by linking his portrait on the front of this coin with a potent visual symbol of Christ, the monumental cross on four steps that had been erected at Jerusalem in the fourth century.</p>\n",
