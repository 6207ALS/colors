    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Deputy director and chair of modern and contemporary art Ann Goldstein.</p>\n<p>Ann Goldstein: This painting is extraordinary in so many ways. It's monumental scale. It's subject matter. It's manner of painting. And also, as a milestone in Warhol's career. He made this painting in 1972, four years after a near fatal assassination attempt that nearly took his life. He was actually pronounced dead and then revived at the hospital. So after a long period of time, and probably physical and emotional recovery, he found his way back to making paintings. He was commissioned to think about making a work of the most famous people in the world. And coincidentally, in 1972, Richard Nixon, then president of the United States, had visited China.</p>\n<p>Richard Nixon: The meeting between the leaders of China and the United States is to seek the normalization of relations between the two countries.</p>\n<p>Ann Goldstein: And Warhol selected him as the most famous man in the world. He then sourced his images. He often did from existing sources. And in this case, he used a portrait of Mao, which was the official portrait from what was always known as the Little Red Book, which was a small book of Mao's writings. His treatment of the image has a certain playfulness and also, remarkably, a considerable amount of hand painting. Early works were so characterized by his use of mechanical processes, and this has that, it has the silkscreen, but then, he also painted on it with brushes, even mops. So it has a kind of virtuosity as well that is so distinctive.</p>\n",
