    "description": "<p>Vincent van Gogh was a great admirer of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35813\">Adolphe Monticelli\u2019s</a> richly impastoed paintings, and he saw in the older artist\u2019s landscapes, flower arrangements, and portraits the sincere expression he was seeking for his own art. He also identified with the myth of the misunderstood artist from Provence that rapidly grew around Monticelli after his death in 1886. Indeed, the artist played a role in Van Gogh\u2019s decision that same year to travel to the South of France, where he hoped to find the source of Monticelli\u2019s light. In this still life, Monticelli\u2019s brilliant yellow fruits anticipate Van Gogh\u2019s celebrated lemon yellow suns.</p>\n",
