    "description": "<p>Pablo Picasso\u2019s remarkable career spanned more than seven decades and influenced nearly every major artistic trend in the first half of the twentieth century. This large, haunting etching, <em>The Frugal Meal</em>, was one of the last works of his Blue Period (1901\u20134), a time when the struggling artist\u2019s palette was dominated by the color blue, then symbolically associated with melancholy\u2014the mood in which he portrayed his array of poor, ill, and outcast characters. Completed just after Picasso settled permanently in France, moving into a dilapidated Montmartre tenement nicknamed the Bateau-Lavoir, or \u201cWasherwoman\u2019s Boat,\u201d this austere etching brings together two subjects that fascinated him\u2014couples in caf\u00e9s and the experience of the blind\u2014with a high degree of refinement. The man\u2019s emaciated face is in profile, while the woman stares directly at the viewer, emphasizing her companion\u2019s blindness. The angular bodies and elongated fingers of the two figures reflect the scarcity of both their meal and their means. <em>The Frugal Meal</em>, which was only Picasso\u2019s second attempt at printmaking, reveals the artist\u2019s extraordinary gift for draftsmanship and his remarkable facility with new media and techniques.</p>\n",
