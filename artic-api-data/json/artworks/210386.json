    "description": "<p>In <em>Still Life</em>, Max Weber rendered diverse objects in a complex and dynamic arrangement. The calligraphic handling of line energizes the individual elements, and the short, choppy brushwork breaks the pictorial space into planes. Inspired by the works of Paul C\u00e9zanne as well as his friendship with Pablo Picasso, he was one of the earliest American artists to explore Cubism. He had met the Spanish artist in Paris while studying there in 1905\u20138, and at that time acquired one of his still lifes\u2014which became the first painting by Picasso to enter the United States when Weber returned to New York.</p>\n",
