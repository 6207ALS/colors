A tumultuous sea plays with Crusader ships (identified by their crescent motif) and encroaches on the panicked crowd, which flees from the embankments. The boat with its sails drawn is similar to a vessel in Ensor\u2019s 1886 etching Christ Calming the Tempest (fig. 1). At lower left, a small musical band continues from sheet 4F. Led by a larger-scaled drum major dressed in blue, his big fur hat covering an earlier rendering of a face, this band and the processing masses that follow suggest this drawing served as a preliminary study for Ensor\u2019s 1886 etching The Cathedral (fig. 2). The drawing is diminished in some areas and is difficult to read under normal conditions, but details are identifiable with the aid of infrared reflectography (see fig. 3). The composition, drawn lightly in black and greenish-blue colored pencil with touches of reddish-orange colored pencil or crayon, is also carried over (although less directly) into sheet 4H. SMC/KJN\n\nEnsor\u2019s fascination with the visual energy produced by the contrasts of light and dark and the interaction of his figures within pictorial space is reflected in both this sheet and the print Capture of a Strange Town (fig. 4; see also sheets 3F, 3G, 3H/I, 4F, 4H, and 4I). Indeed, the artist was constantly preoccupied by light and space. Ensor had a strong memory for composition and design; the work of other artists seems to have frequently stuck with him and been integrated into his own oeuvre. Closer consideration of Capture of a Strange Town reveals a probable source for its composition: the mezzotint Belshazzar\u2019s Feast by John Martin, an English Romantic artist and favorite of King Leopold I of Belgium (fig. 5). The explosion of the elements and fantastical landscapes lie at the heart of Martin\u2019s biblical scenes, which exhibit an energy that clearly left its mark on Ensor. The Belgian artist likely saw Martin\u2019s work in Ernest Chesneau\u2019s La peinture anglaise (English Painting; A. Quantin, 1882), as he copied several works from this book.
