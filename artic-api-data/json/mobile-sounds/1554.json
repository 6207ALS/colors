    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Edouard Manet's painting of Jesus mocked by Roman soldiers before his crucifixion is extraordinary in many ways. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: By the 1860s when Manet paints this, there were very few artists who were still taking on Biblical subjects. You have the beginning of an Impressionist subject matter, modern life subject matter, so this was a really odd thing for the artist who prided himself on being a man of the moment. What he's done is he's taken a very traditional text and he's made it incredibly provocative and modern.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Manet referred to Jesus rather than Christ in the painting's title, emphasizing his ordinary humanity rather than his divinity, and his portrayal of Jesus seems deliberately anti-heroic.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And if you look closely at this painting you'll see that his figure for Christ is made out of these incredibly thick concentric circles which he uses continuously around the legs, around the abdomen, around the shoulders, around the muscles. And it's very modern. And the critics were horrified.</p>\n",
