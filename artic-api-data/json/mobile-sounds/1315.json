    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The original versions of these exquisitely modeled dancing figures made their debut at the celebrated 1900 Exposition Universelle or Universal Exhibition in Paris.  The figures were part of a set of 15 intended to be grouped together as a dramatic centerpiece for a dining table.  They were made at the S\u00e8vres porcelain manufactory near Paris, by then famous for its delicate creations in unglazed porcelain such as these pieces.  The figures reflect the influence of the Art Nouveau or New Art movement in their fluid curving lines.  These are created by their graceful poses and echoed by their flowing dresses with their sweeping Greek style pleats and wide fluttering sleeves.  The figures were also inspired by the American performer, Loie Fuller.  Fuller's sensational dances enhanced with whirling billowing silk scarves and ethereal light effects had enthralled Paris in the years leading up to 1900.</p>\n",
