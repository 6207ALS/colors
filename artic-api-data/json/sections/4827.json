Walker Fund, 1965.243\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">With a stump, eraser, and occasional direct charcoal strokes, Henri Matisse developed his forms through the addition and subtraction of tone in a manner akin to a sculptural process. The artist\u2019s multiple design changes and extensions of his paper support reveal how the drawing evolved as he worked.\n\nMatisse drew with a stump dipped in loose charcoal, yielding diffuse gray tones. He shaded and modeled his forms primarily using tone rather than line. As the artist developed and altered the drawing, he rubbed the stump to minimize previous marks. He likely employed stumps of various sizes to manipulate the charcoal (see fig. 36.1), using the tip to draw narrow lines, such as those delineating the architectural details at upper right (see fig. 36.2), and the flat, broad edge for wide strokes and the extensive blending seen throughout. Matisse could have worked with loose charcoal purchased in a packet or vial or rubbed a charcoal stick against sandpaper to generate the powdery medium for stumping.\n\nThe artist also used an eraser extensively to erase and minimize evidence of design changes, to lighten areas by subtracting tone, and to articulate forms against the background, for example, erasing to clarify the left edge of the chair (see fig. 36.3). Matisse dragged his eraser in repeating vertical strokes to achieve the white lines indicating fringe on the front of the chair (see fig. 36.3). He alternated stump and eraser, using both in broad, directional strokes, to help define forms in the figure and chair (see fig. 36.4).\n\nThere are a relatively small number of directly drawn, dark charcoal lines, such as those outlining the bottoms of the feet. There are other fine, dark lines in the nose, lips, chin, neck, and proper right breast, which were made with the sharp tip of a charcoal stick (see fig. 36.5). Their angularity and narrow width are incongruous with the rest of the drawing, yet they appear to give definition and solidity to forms that Matisse rendered softly. Under microscope examination 150\u00d7 the marks appear to have been made with a very hard charcoal stick that retained a fine point.\n\nMatisse made many changes and adjustments as he drew, including extending the support by adding paper strips to the right and top edges, sequentially, which reveals the evolutionary process of this drawing. He shifted the position of the chair and figure up and to the right multiple times. He began with the chair at the left edge of the sheet. At least four previous outlines for the left side of the chair are apparent (see fig. 36.6). Adjustments to the chair arm at right and the lower chair edge are also visible. Evidence of shifts in the sitter\u2019s proper left leg and foot and the proper right knee remain as well.\n\nMatisse began drawing on a 56 \u00d7 38 cm sheet of paper. Pinholes at all corners of this sheet indicate it was tacked down as he began to sketch. He extended the composition by first adding a paper strip (56 \u00d7 13 cm) at right. He pasted this onto the verso of the primary sheet. Two dark fingerprints at the lower right edge of the first sheet likely resulted when Matisse touched the charcoal with wet fingers as he attached the pasted paper extension. He next added the strip (6.5 \u00d7 49 cm) along the top edge. All pieces are the same type of ivory wove paper. There are multiple pinholes at all corners and edges of the final pieced support, indicating he worked with it tacked to a drawing board or pinned it to the wall later on.\n\nThis drawing is not fixed, despite the loose powdery nature of the charcoal medium. There is an offset image from another charcoal drawing on the verso that must have resulted when the drawings were stored in contact (see fig. 36.7).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in charcoal) (fig. 36.8).\n\nMatisse drew using charcoal with stumping and erasing. Overall the charcoal tonality is warm gray with the densest applications appearing brown-black, suggesting natural charcoal. The charcoal particles appear relatively fine under microscope magnification 300\u00d7.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper, pieced. This is a good-quality drawing paper with a moderate screen texture on the recto. The primary support is composed of three pieces of the same Arches ivory wove paper, joined. The largest sheet measures 56 \u00d7 38 cm. Matisse pasted a strip measuring 56 \u00d7 13 cm along the right edge then pasted another strip, measuring 6.5 \u00d7 49 cm, along the top edge. The structure is evident in transmitted light (see fig. 36.9). The largest sheet has a deckle edge at top and bottom, indicating 56 cm is the original sheet height. The strip on the right has deckle edges at the left and bottom. The top strip has a deckle edge at right. All other edges are hand cut. For an image of the verso, see fig. 36.7.\n\nThere is a partial watermark in the lower left edge of the largest sheet: [ ]T ARCHES (1.8 \u00d7 14.8 cm) (fig. 36.10). There is a countermark in the upper right corner of the largest sheet and in the top of the paper strip adhered along the right edge: MBM (1.8 \u00d7 8.6 cm) (fig. 36.11).\n\n61.2 \u00d7 49.4 cm (23 7/8 \u00d7 19 3/8 in.).\n\nThere is no record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. A minor tear from the center of the right edge has been repaired on the verso with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste. There is brown adhesive residue and staining at the upper right and left corners of the verso from former hinges that have been removed. Otherwise there is no evidence of conservation intervention.\n\nThe adhesive used to join the paper strips at the right and top has darkened, staining the paper. The edges have darkened from contact with an acidic frame rebate or face mat. There is some abrasion at the left top edge where the paper has cockled and the charcoal has been rubbed off the high points, leaving faint lines above and behind the woman\u2019s head. There is a dark accretion in the seat of the chair located 16 cm from the lower edge and 28.5 cm from the right edge. There are brown pinpoint stains in the lower right corner. A pattern of small, dark spots scattered across all three pieces of the support is visible when examined with ultraviolet light (254 and 365 nm).  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York.\n\nB.
