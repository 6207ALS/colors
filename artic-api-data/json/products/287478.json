    "description": "African American artists have made monumental contributions to the world of art, producing an influential body of work informed by the Black experience. Celebrated here is the art of Eldzier Cortor, Alma Woodsey Thomas, Jacob Lawrence, Horace Pippin, Charles Ethan Porter, Romare Bearden, Malvin Gray Johnson, Faith Ringgold, Archibald Motley Jr., William H. Johnson, Kaaria Mucherera, and Charles White\u2014some of whom are very well known and others who aren\u2019t but should be. Working in diverse styles, techniques, and media, many of these artists have created memorable images laced with social commentary, cultural affirmation, myth and history, and simple love for people in all their beauty, folly, and nobility. Others have discarded the constraints of representational imagery for an abstract language that challenges viewers to consider the familiar and the unknown from new perspectives.
