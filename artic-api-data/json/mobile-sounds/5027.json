    "transcript": "<p>The Three Skulls is a watercolor painting with graphite on ivory wove paper. Paul Cezanne created it between 1902 and 1906. It measures about 1 1/2 feet high by 2 feet wide.</p>\n<p>Three partial human skulls rest in the center of the painting. The skulls are missing the lower jaw, and they have no teeth. They are arranged in a triangle, with two on the bottom in front and a third placed further back and closer to the top of the paper. One skull is slightly angled to your left, while the other two face forward. The skulls are mostly unpainted, so they are the off-white color of the paper. The eye sockets, nose holes, and curves of the skulls are painted to indicate shadows. Some shadows are dark, nearly black, but others are yellow, blue, and red. You can see traces of graphite underneath the paint and around the edges of the skulls; they reveal Cezanne\u2019s original sketch.</p>\n<p>The skulls rest on a patterned tablecloth painted in hues of blue, turquoise, and reddish-orange. The pattern resembles flowers near the center of the painting but fades and blurs toward the edges. Where the pattern fades away at the front left of the cloth, areas of unpainted paper are exposed. Underneath the skulls, the tablecloth is flat, but it bunches and folds in the top left corner. There is a wash of color behind the tablecloth to indicate the table in gold, purple, and gray. The top third of the paper is largely unpainted, with some faint applications of color.</p>\n",
