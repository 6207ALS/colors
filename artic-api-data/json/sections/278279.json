It appears first in an oil of 1880/85 entitled Street in Old Chelsea (YMSM 249; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), and was also the subject of two etchings of the mid-1880s, The Fish-Shop, Busy Chelsea (K 264) and Little Maunder\u2019s (K 279). This transfer lithograph, printed in October 1890 (see app. II.3 and app. II.4), offers the most complete record of the quaint facade; in the other images, an awning obscures the proprietor\u2019s name and other details.\n\nWhen first transferred and proved, the letters in \u201cmaunder\u201d were blurred and difficult to read. In the second state, the letters were tidied up. According to T. R. Way\u2019s 1905 catalogue, twenty-eight proofs were then pulled from the original stone. However, this count is too low, as there were thirty-one impressions, both signed and unsigned, in the artist\u2019s estate in 1903.\n\nThe Way firm transferred the image to supplementary stones and machine printed a large edition for inclusion in The Whirlwind. There is some evidence that Whistler may not have finished Maunder\u2019s Fish Shop, Chelsea in time for the intended publication date. In its 29 November 1890 issue, The Whirlwind printed the following notice under the heading \u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s \u2018Songs on Stone\u2019\u201d: \u201cIt may be whispered into the ear of eager watchers who are anxiously awaiting the third masterpiece in this marvellous series that their yearnings will most probably be gratified next week.\u201d However, a delay was announced in the following issue, and the lithograph did not appear until December 27, in what was to be the last issue of The Whirlwind. The printed legend at the top of each impression carried the previous week\u2019s date: Dec. 20, 1890.\n\nThe letters A, E, and R in the name MAUNDER. have not yet been clarified by scraping (fig. 37a).\n\nGlasgow: HAG, off-white plate paper (384 \u00d7 278 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other first-state impressions are found in Cambridge, Mass., FAM; and New York, MMA.\n\nThe letters A, E, and R in the shop\u2019s name have been scraped slightly so that they and the period following the name are more legible.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (329 \u00d7 233 mm), signed; Palmer, cream Japanese paper (290 \u00d7 221 mm). Glasgow: HAG (10), cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; grayish ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 203 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (310 \u00d7 204 mm); cream Japanese paper (318 \u00d7 201 mm); ivory laid paper (332 \u00d7 199 mm), signed; cream wove proofing paper (273 \u00d7 216 mm); tan laid paper (267 \u00d7 260 mm), inscribed, in Whistler\u2019s hand, No 5; tan laid paper (259 \u00d7 208 mm); tan laid paper (259 \u00d7 205 mm); tan laid paper (260 \u00d7 199 mm). London: BM, off-white wove paper (226 \u00d7 180 mm) mounted on white plate paper (360 \u00d7 265 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 201 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (325 \u00d7 200 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA; Boston, MFA; and New York, NYPL.\n\nPublished edition. Despite the date given in the legend, the lithograph was actually inserted in the 27 December 1890 issue of The Whirlwind. The periodical edition was machine printed from supplementary stones on smooth ivory wove paper, which has often discolored to cream. Periodical impressions tend to be slightly coarser, glossier, and higher in contrast than those printed by hand. Many impressions have been trimmed to remove the legend.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (286 \u00d7 222 mm), with legend. Glasgow: HAG (6), on cream wove papers that range in color from ivory to cream and measure approximately 287 \u00d7 225 mm, one mounted on card. LONDON: V&amp;A, cream wove paper (287 \u00d7 222 mm), with legend. Washington: FGA, cream wove paper (287 \u00d7 224 mm), with legend; LC cream wove paper (282 \u00d7 224 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other periodical impressions are found in Boston, BPL; Clevelend, CMA; New York, MMA (2); and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.
