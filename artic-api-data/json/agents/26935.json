    "description": "<p>Gerrit van Honthorst worked in two radically different styles, which was unusual for a 17th-century painter: first creating dramatically lit works that followed in the footsteps of Michelangelo da Caravaggio, then specializing in allegorical portraiture as a court artist. After training with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33665/abraham-bloemaert\" target=\"_blank\">Abraham Bloemaert</a> in his native Utrecht, Honthorst spent a decade in Rome, where he was patronized by the leading connoisseurs of the city. Honthorst earned the nickname \u201cGherardo delle Notti\u201d (Gerard of the Nights) because of works such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/243872/a-boy-blowing-on-a-firebrand\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Boy Blowing on a Firebrand</em></a>. The subtle differences between the light reflected off the boy\u2019s puffed cheeks, the metal hilt of the sword, and the soft feathers reveal the artist\u2019s sensitivity to materiality and surface. The subject\u2019s antiquated, theatrical garb adds further character to the painting, and demonstrates the impact that Honthorst\u2019s work had upon artists like Georges de la Tour and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40769/rembrandt-van-rijn\" target=\"_blank\">Rembrandt van Rijn</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Honthorst left Rome to work for several years in Utrecht, before spending time at the courts in London and The Hague. During this period, he executed trompe l\u2019oeil ceiling paintings, in which figures appear to peer down from an open sky, and elegant portraits that were often <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9453/adriaen-pauw-lord-of-heemstede\" target=\"_blank\">reproduced in print</a>.</p><p>The Art Institute owns one of Honthorst\u2019s many surviving drawings, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/227319/christ-in-the-garden-of-olives\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Christ in the Garden of Olives</em></a>. It is a fine example of a working drawing, meaning it was used to transfer the design to a canvas. The arched upper edge and placement of the weary Christ close to the picture plane indicate that the final painting was destined to be an altarpiece. It was almost certainly made during the artist\u2019s Italian stay. These works by Honthorst help bridge the production of artists in Italy and those in the Netherlands within the Art Institute\u2019s collections of 17th-century art.</p>",
