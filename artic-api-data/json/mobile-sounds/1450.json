    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Made around 3000 years ago in Japan this figurine has a powerful presence despite its tiny size. It\u2019s bent arm and long elegant body indicate that it was likely made to be held comfortably in one\u2019s hand. And if you look closely the figurine seems to have a swollen belly. It likely represents a pregnant woman and may have been used in childbirth rituals intended to ensure a safe delivery for mother and child. Such figures also played a part in prayers for rebirth. J\u014dmon period figurines were made in a variety of sizes and shapes. Some were unadorned like this one, while others look like they are wearing elaborate costumes. Despite these differences these figurines have something in common. They are often found broken having been used or thrown away as part of a ritual.</p>\n",
