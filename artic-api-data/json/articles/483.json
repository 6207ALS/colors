    "copy": " Sophie and I are now in our fourth year of touring the Art Institute\u2019s galleries together. It\u2019s my favorite annual event because she continues to force me to see something I\u2019ve already seen a hundred times in a new way . . . which is exactly what the Surrealists\u2014and especially Magritte\u2014strove to do in their own work. Magritte wanted to\u2014in his own words\u2014make \u201ceveryday objects shriek out loud\u201d and encourage the viewer to continually question the world around them. One of the ways he accomplished this was by keeping some mystery around the narratives in his paintings and letting the viewer use their own ideas, associations, and opinions to develop a story. Sophie loved the fact that Magritte didn\u2019t give anything away and had no problems imagining what might be taking place. She told me tales of acrobatic mangoes and flying turtles and candles turning into snakes. She also extended her narratives outside the art. In The Secret Player (home of the aforementioned flying turtle), she invented a character off the left side of the painting who was throwing a ball to the men pictured. This makes complete sense as you look at the painting\u2014the figures in white are looking off in that direction, tensed as if they\u2019re waiting for something\u2014but I had never thought to go outside the canvas, to think about what else is out there in Magritte\u2019s strange world. And so as you visit Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926\u20131938 this summer, I encourage you to think like Sophie and let your imagination run wild. It\u2019s what Magritte would have wanted, after all. \u2014Katie Rahn ",
