At no other time in the long history of the painter and dealer\u2019s relationship were market conditions sufficiently strong to sustain two such large displays: the 1892 retrospective featured fifty works and the 1893 exhibition forty-six. In 1894 the dealer again organized another monographic Pissarro show, but this one included a mere thirty pieces. Even the artist\u2019s solo exhibition in 1896 did not equal the size of either his 1892 or 1893 shows, with only thirty-five works. The next big monographic shows of comparable size only took place in 1901 and 1903\u2014sadly, however, this last exhibition opened in New York a few weeks after he died. It is safe to say then, that Pissarro\u2019s 1892 and 1893 solo shows were of monumental importance. Haymaking at \u00c9ragny was one of the paintings featured (as no. 38) in the 1893 exhibition, which included virtually all of the finished oil paintings Pissarro made that year as well as six works from the 1880s, including one from 1889 (fig. 12.1 [PDRS 866]) that shares the same principal figure of a woman raking.\n\nUnlike many earlier Pissarro exhibitions, this one offered neither works on paper, nor any paintings in tempera or gouache. Clearly Durand-Ruel felt that the recent oils were more marketable than the rest of the artist\u2019s output\u2014a complete reversal of his stance in the second half of the 1880s. The exhibition in 1893 was, essentially, divided into groups of paintings with related themes or works made in series, including two series representing the annual floods of the Epte River in \u00c9ragny (in 1891 and 1892), a series made in Kew Gardens outside London, a series of winter landscapes of \u00c9ragny, and a few other landscapes, also executed in \u00c9ragny, representing the area immediately surrounding Pissarro\u2019s house. It is evident that the artist had been moved\u2014and influenced by\u2014the exhibition of Claude Monet\u2019s series of grain stacks (see cats. 27\u201333 in Monet Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago) presented the year before at Durand-Ruel, Paris; although Pissarro\u2019s own sense of series differed profoundly from Monet\u2019s, he paid his friend the ultimate compliment by arranging his recent works into what one might call a \u201cseries of series.\u201d The exhibition ended with Pissarro\u2019s most recently finished urban paintings, which were barely dry when it opened (see fig. 12.2 [PDRS 986]; cat. 13).\n\nThe present work is one of a handful of important, large-scale pictorial investigations of the hay harvest made over the course of Pissarro\u2019s career. The first was his representation of Summer for the cycle of four seasons commissioned by Achille Arosa in 1872 (fig. 12.3 [PDRS 240]). There is also one of his most important large paintings on silk, The Harvest (1882 [PV 1358]; fig. 12.4). A little later Pissarro continued with an important group of Neo-Impressionist harvest pictures, including Haymaking, \u00c9ragny (1887; fig. 12.5 [PDRS 848])\u2014from which the figure of the raking woman in the present work ultimately derives\u2014and Haymakers Resting (1891; fig. 12.6 [PDRS 920]). Because Pissarro spent most of the summer of 1892 in London, where he painted the series of works representing Kew Gardens shown in the 1893 exhibition, the vivid scene portrayed in the present work could only have been painted once he returned to \u00c9ragny on August 15.\n\nLike most of the \u00c9ragny landscapes in the 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel, Haymaking at \u00c9ragny was painted from the west-facing window on the second floor of the barn that Pissarro had converted into a studio. He chose this space largely because the eye condition from which he suffered made it difficult to paint outdoors; the new arrangement, however, forced him to look down on the landscape rather than stand in the open air, as he had for decades (see fig. 12.7, fig. 12.8, and fig. 12.9). This indirectness is felt in the majority of the \u00c9ragny landscapes of 1891\u201392 and was made permanent in 1893, when, most likely with the proceeds from the Durand-Ruel exhibition, he was able to enhance this studio space significantly, creating a large north-facing window. Pissarro retained the smaller west-facing window, and its view of the alluvial plain of the Epte River toward the village of Bazincourt became a staple of his oeuvre.\n\nWhat is particularly interesting about Haymaking at \u00c9ragny is that Pissarro made it after he returned from London as the new owner of the farm that he had rented since 1883. His wife, Julie, having learned that the property would be sold, had taken advantage of his absence in England to visit Monet, asking him to lend them the money to buy it. Monet complied, forcing the proud\u2014and anarchist\u2014Pissarro to be a landowner, which was completely against anarchist principles: \u201cProperty is theft!\u201d famously declared Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whom Pissarro had avidly read. Of even greater personal concern was the fact that the artist now found himself owing money to his old friend, a notion that almost terrified him. The letter he wrote to his wife when he learned of the purchase mixes anger, complaint, resentment, and love in equal measure. Nonetheless, Pissarro had little choice but to accept the situation, particularly after Monet himself intervened by writing to his old friend. Hence, when Pissarro returned to \u00c9ragny on August 15, he returned as the owner of a substantial farm with a large house, a barn, and several acres of fields and gardens. The slice of nature that he painted was, for the first time in his life, his own.\n\nAlthough made from his studio window, Haymaking at \u00c9ragny is startlingly accurate. Its surface suggests that the work was completed in two major phases with ample drying time in between; the landscape was done during the first phase, and in the second stage Pissarro added the hay in the foreground and the figure, which he likely borrowed from another work in the studio and, quite possibly, from a lost drawing. This woman also appears in a gouache and a print of 1889 (fig. 12.10 and fig. 12.11), suggesting that it was, by 1892, a stock type that Pissarro could borrow when he needed a plausible, large-scale female harvester to anchor what was one of his largest canvases of the year. The painting represents both a grain field and a small, recently planted orchard just down the hill from his barn. He represented the orchard often later in the year, and a careful examination of the various pictures indicates that he played with the curved forms of the various trees according to the pictorial demands of the particular composition and format. Sometimes he depicted two rows of trees, as in a canvas painted in the fall of the same year (fig. 12.12 [PDRS 963]). On other occasions, the trees seem not to be in rows at all (see fig. 12.13 [PDRS 962]), instead twisting to the right or the left as required compositionally, and to create a curvilinear pattern that relaxes the picture\u2019s planar surface.\n\nLike all of Pissarro\u2019s canvases from 1892, Haymaking at \u00c9ragny exhibits a luscious and chromatically varied pictorial surface, likely the product of his experimentation with various techniques throughout the 1880s. One of the earliest descriptions of Pissarro\u2019s facture was made by C. Andr\u00e9 in a review in Le fran\u00e7ais of the 1882 Impressionist exhibition. He observed the unusual effect of what he termed Pissarro\u2019s peinture en relief (relief painting) approach, and characterized the appearance of Pissarro\u2019s canvas surface as a topographical map with peaks and valleys. This deeply furrowed, textured surface\u2014which Andr\u00e9 considered three-dimensional\u2014was a technique that Pissarro had developed by 1877. The artist used a wide spectrum of hues in relatively small areas on his canvas, which tend toward gray as the colors combine at a distance (fig. 12.14). Therefore, Andr\u00e9\u2019s description of these surfaces as \u201crelief painting\u201d\u2014although made as a criticism\u2014was in fact accurate and important. In the latter half of the 1880s Pissarro had learned additional lessons about this kind of multicolored technique through his experimentation with the Neo-Impressionist aesthetic. Since giving up this approach, his entire attitude toward the picture and its surface had relaxed, and the 1893 exhibition, with its small group of earlier works, must have made this clear. Pissarro, the so-called father of Impressionism, had become an Impressionist again\u2014but this time, he had formulated his own approach to picture making: his handling is freer and looser and seems almost effortlessly graceful. Indeed, he even wrote critically about \u201cthe Neos,\u201d as he called them, in letters of 1892 and 1893.\n\nThe canvas is masterful largely because it is so simply composed, so quickly painted, and so confident in its chromatic explorations. After trying to keep up with the younger generation of artists and experimenting with a new technique in the late 1880s, Pissarro reassessed his artistic approach and stuck to what he knew best.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro began this composition on a commercially primed no. 25 (figure) standard-size canvas. Above the almost-white ground he first executed a contour sketch of the landscape elements, including the thinner trees, in a combination of charcoal or black chalk and very dilute blue paint. Roughly following the contours of this sketch, the artist articulated the individual trees and striations of the landscape in low impasto and a limited palette before moving in with heavier impasto in a wider array of colors. There were minor changes to some of the trees; Pissarro slimmed, straightened, and slightly moved trunks and branches, and he also painted out a large outcropping of foliage that extended into the sky from the tree in the right foreground. The landscape elements and the sky appear to have been built up more or less simultaneously and allowed to dry before the artist added the figures, including the large female figure at the right, and the heaps of hay in the foreground. Pissarro\u2019s handling and manipulation of the paint in the foreground created long, sweeping, ribbonlike lines of wet-in-wet impasto that give the work an almost sculptural quality. The painting is currently unvarnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 12.15).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro 1892 (lower left, in blue paint) (fig. 12.16). Stereomicroscopic examination suggests that the signature was executed when the upper layers of the ground were still soft (see fig. 12.17).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen.\n\nThe original size of the canvas was very close to its current size, 65 \u00d7 80.9 cm. This corresponds to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size (81 \u00d7 65 cm) canvas turned horizontally; this is also the standard size stamped on the verso of the canvas (fig. 12.18).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 34.3V (0.8) \u00d7 33.5 H (1.0) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas is of a very fine weave with scalloping corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. Strong primary scalloping along the left side, seen in the thread-angle map, may relate to commercial preparation (fig. 12.19). Close examination of the left edge also reveals that at least some of this edge was originally unprimed; this may be the margin of unprimed canvas along the edge of a larger section in commercial preparation (fig. 12.20).\n\nCurrent stretching: The work was locally restretched at the top, corners, and sections of the right and left sides during a 2006 local edge-lining treatment; although some tacks were added to create more even tension, previous tacks and tackholes were used wherever possible. Elsewhere, the painting seems to have retained its original stretching (fig. 12.21), with hand-wrought tacks placed approximately 3.5\u20136.5 cm apart and corresponding with cusping seen in the X-ray.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The painting appears to have retained its original stretcher (fig. 12.22). The work has a five-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a vertical crossbar, or a chassis \u00e0 cl\u00e9s. The mod\u00e8le d\u00e9pos\u00e9 B stamp on the crossbar is the registered trademark of Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 (fig. 12.23). Depth: 1.9 cm.\n\nNumber  \nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: black stencil/stamp  \nContent: 25 (fig. 12.24)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso  \nMethod: black stencil/stamp  \nContent: TOILES \u00e1 PEINDRE \u00e1 COULEURS FINES / P.

The edges of this preparatory layer suggest the priming was applied with a brush. The ground is left visible in skips and lacunae throughout the work.\n\nThe ground appears almost white, with some dark particles visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 12.28). These particles may be on the surface, as visual examination of a cross section of the ground and canvas did not reveal any colored particles in the layer.\n\nXRF analysis suggests that the ground is composed of predominantly lead white with iron oxides, calcium compounds such as calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate, and barium sulfate. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination suggests that the artist sketched the basic forms of the trees, including the thinnest ones, and some of the basic delineations of the landscape before painting (fig. 12.29). The figures, however, including the large foreground figure, are executed directly over the thickly painted background without evidence of underdrawing. Due to the thinness of the underdrawing and the thickness of subsequent paint layers, the full extent of the underdrawing is not entirely clear.\n\nThe underdrawing is executed in a combination of black chalk or charcoal and very thin, fluid blue paint (fig. 12.30). It is unclear if the artist first executed a light sketch in dry media and applied the paint over it in an attempt to set it before painting, or whether the underdrawing media was a mixture of chalk or charcoal particles in thin blue paint. The underdrawing varies in thickness from semitranslucent to almost transparent (fig. 12.31).\n\nThe artist appears to have generally followed his underdrawing without adhering to the lines exactly (fig. 12.32). No changes were noted in the planning/drawing stage (see Paint Layer).\n\nThe composition and technique of the painting indicate the work was completed in stages: the first concentrated on the general landscape elements, and the second focused on adding the figures and building up heavily textured hay in the foreground. After executing a faint underdrawing to denote the trees and the striations of the landscape, Pissarro started laying in flat planes of color. Beginning with the trees he loosely followed the underdrawing, sometimes slimming and altering the curves of the tree trunks as he painted. These are predominantly underpainted in numerous shades of pale pink and purple, with great modulation in tone throughout and many colors mixed directly on the canvas rather than on the palette. The tree at the far right in the foreground, for example, is underpainted in a very pale cool pink (fig. 12.33), while the large tree at the left has visible underpainting throughout the branches and foliage in bright pinkish-purple (fig. 12.34). In some cases, evidence of the artist\u2019s compositional changes is more visible due to the underpainting rather than the underdrawing, as in the thin tree second from the right. Here, Pissarro first executed the trunk with a small, flat brush carrying as many as three different colors at once, including deep blue, red lake, and white (fig. 12.35). The first indication of this tree, in which the bottom bows to the left rather than straight down, is still visible with careful examination of the surface under normal viewing conditions, and is more clear in the infrared images. At the far right the presence of light pink visible under the green grass, in addition to a faint form visible in the X-ray, suggests the trunk of this tree may have been further to the right, curving in from the right edge (fig. 12.36). Other forms, such as a low-hanging branch on the far right tree (visible in the X-ray), seem less resolved and appear to have been abandoned relatively early in the painting process. In the transmitted-light and X-ray images an outcropping of leaves can be seen jutting out from the group of trees at the right; this cluster of leaves and extended branches likely corresponded to the thinner tree slightly to the left and in front of the wider tree. With this asymmetric leafy outcropping this tree would have somewhat mirrored the foreground tree at the left. Smaller alterations to the trees, such as slimming or slightly straightening the trunks and moving the branches, as Pissarro did with the right fork of the second tree from the left (visible in the infrared image), may have been made slightly later in the painting process. In most cases the artist covered these changes heavily with subsequent layers, and only hints of these earlier compositional ideas are still visible on the surface (fig. 12.30).\n\nAfter the trees were initially established Pissarro brought in the yellows and greens of the striated landscape, underpainted the foliage between the trees and the architectural elements at the center of the composition in muted, earthy yellows and pale greens, and laid in the sky in shades of pale blue. In the next painting stage he included more textured strokes and a wider variety of colors. Where the trees extend into the sky, the artist moved back and forth between the foliage and the background, covering some of the previously underpainted branches and leaves with the directional strokes for the clouds and sky; he then executed the finer and more specific details of the trees on top and in between the directional strokes in the sky (fig. 12.37). The result is that the taller, darker trees on either side of the foreground each have discrete, discernible branches and a distinct, individual shape compared to the more generalized, round-topped trees behind them.\n\nAfter working up the sky and basic landscape elements Pissarro appears to have halted the painting and allowed the work to dry. The X-ray indicates that all four figures, including the large female figure at the right, were executed on top of the dry landscape (fig. 12.38). The large figure also shows no evidence of underdrawing, and her features appear rather generalized; evidence of the light greens and yellows of the underlying grasses from the landscape can be seen in lacunae throughout her clothing (fig. 12.39). Close examination of the foreground indicates the bright grasses extended all the way to the bottom edge of the picture, and the heavily textured mounds of hay were added later (fig. 12.40 and fig. 12.41). The hay itself was executed with paint of a paste-like consistency and fine, soft brushes that impart very little of their texture to the paint but rather dragged the paint across the surface, creating ribbons of heavily textured, wet-in-wet impasto (fig. 12.42 and fig. 12.43). The artist\u2019s technique in the foreground manifests an intimate awareness of his medium; Pissarro knew the precise consistency of paint, the size and softness of the brush, and how often to rinse it to achieve particular results, and he combined this knowledge with sure-handed, directional movements to achieve these ribbon-like effects and an exact degree of wet-in-wet blending of colors on the picture surface (fig. 12.44).\n\nPredominantly small, round and flat brushes of varying softness, with strokes up to 0.4 cm.\n\nAnalysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, vermilion, madder lake, iron-oxide red and/or yellow, chrome yellow, cobalt blue, cobalt violet, emerald green, and possibly viridian.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work is currently unvarnished, with some residues of older natural-resin varnish in areas of heavy impasto. A natural-resin varnish was removed in 2006; a verso image from 1984 shows evidence of prior cleaning or a varnish application after the work had aged and cracked, suggesting this varnish was not original.\n\nThe painting was treated in 2006 when a thick natural resin varnish was removed. Tearing at all four corners was mended with local bandages of fine-weave polyester fabric and Beva 371 film. Along the right edge and the left half of the top edge, as well as two spots along the left side, tacks had rusted and pulled through the canvas, causing the canvas to pull away from the stretcher; these areas were locally edge-lined like the corners. A padded insert backing was added to help support the unlined canvas. The work required little retouching and was left unvarnished.\n\nThe work is adequately tensioned on its stretcher, with some minor buckling along the top and dips at the upper corners, seen in the raking light image. Aside from local edge-lining, the painting maintains its original stretcher and stretching. The canvas itself is in good condition, still largely flexible with few damages; small, somewhat evenly placed punctures along the edges just inside the foldover appear as small nail or tack holes and may be evidence that a strip frame was once attached to the front of the painting; flattened paint along the edges near these holes suggests contact with a frame or similar structure while the paint was still soft. The foldover edges, except at left, remain largely uncracked, and the corner and local edge-linings applied during the 2006 treatment appear stable. The tacking margins, aside from large holes sustained from tacks pulling through, also exhibit a number of smaller holes similar to those seen on the front, but more closely placed; these may also relate to former framing elements. There are multiple layers of paper tape intermittently along the edges, and the verso shows signs of previous cleaning or wiping before the 2006 treatment.\n\nThe ground and paint layers are in good condition with few losses or accretions. Aside from losses relating to support loss at the corners and the punctures along the edges, there are a few losses in the sky, a small vertical loss near the left edge by the lower tree branches, a small loss of upper paint layers in the hem of the skirt on the woman at the right, and a similar loss on the tree trunk at the left. There is fine age and microcracking in many of the thickly painted areas, most of which cannot be seen easily with the naked eye and appear to be stable. The painting is unvarnished, with some residues of natural-resin varnish in areas of high impasto.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, 1960/70 reproduction of a Louis XVI fluted scotia frame with acanthus leaves at the miters and lamb\u2019s-tongue sight molding with an independent fillet and cove liner. The frame has water and oil gilding over red bole on sprayed gesso. The rails are burnished, as are portions of the lamb\u2019s-tongue ornament, and the gilding has been heavily rubbed and toned. The carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is astragal chaplet with bead-and-barrel ornament; scotia side; fillet; fillet rail; fillet; scotia, fluted with acanthus leaves at the miters; flat frieze; ogee with lamb\u2019s-tongue ornament; and an independent fillet and cove liner (fig. 12.45).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 3, 1892.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Jan. 15, 1894.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland, Chicago, Oct. 19, 1899.\n\nBy descent from Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland (died 1933), Chicago, to her son, Bruce Borland, Chicago.\n\nGiven by Bruce Borland, Chicago, to the Art Institute, beginning in 1961.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro, Mar. 15\u201330, 1893, cat. 38, as Fenaison \u00e0 Eragny, 1892.\n\nNew York, Durand-Ruel Galleries, Paintings by Camille Pissarro, Views of Rouen, Mar.\u2013Apr., 1897, cat. 33, as Fenaison \u00e0 Eragny, 1892.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Treasures of Chicago Collectors, Apr. 15\u2013May 7, 1961, no cat. no.\n\nTokyo, Isetan Museum of Art, Retrospective Camille Pissarro, Mar. 9\u00ad\u2013Apr. 9, 1984, cat. 43 (ill.); Fukuoka Art Museum, Apr. 25\u2013May 20, 1984; Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art, May 26\u2013July 1, 1984.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Art Inside Out: Exploring Art and Culture through Time, Sept. 19, 1992\u2013June 16, 1996, no cat (fig. 12.46).\n\nStaatsgalerie Stuttgart, Claude Monet: Effet de soleil\u2014Felder im Fr\u00fchling, May 20\u2013Sept. 24, 2006, cat. 44 (ill.).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro, exh. cat.

The Art Institute currently uses a title that is based on the one that was given to the painting when it was exhibited in 1893 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, in Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nMar. 15, 1893: Fenaison \u00e0 \u00c9ragny (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro, exh. cat.

Pissarro\u2019s 1892 show was entitled Camille Pissarro and ran from January 23, 1892, to February 20, 1893. His 1893 show Oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro ran from March 15 to 30. Durand-Ruel bought Haymaking at \u00c9ragny directly from Pissarro on December 3, 1892, a few months prior to the opening of the artist\u2019s solo show, at which it made its debut.\n\nPDRS, vol. 1, p. 364. Pissarro\u2019s 1894 solo show, Camille Pissarro\u2014Tableaux, aquarelles, pastels, gouaches, was held, once again, at Durand-Ruel, Paris, March 3\u201321.\n\nPDRS, vol. 1, pp. 365\u201366. Pissarro\u2019s solo show in 1901 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, included forty-two works.\n\nFor works depicting the flooding of the Epte and exhibited at Pissarro\u2019s 1893 solo show, see PDRS 927, 928, 977\u201380, vol. 3, pp. 609\u201310, 636\u201338.

PDRS 950 was also exhibited (A Pond in Kew, London), but it is more of a water than a garden scene.

According to Pissarro in a letter from Paris dated on May 5, 1891, to his son Lucien, he was left speechless by the beauty of Monet\u2019s series. A few weeks earlier, however, perhaps because of Monet\u2019s wildly successful series of haystacks, Pissarro may have been slightly envious, when he wrote to his son on April 9, 1891, that all the collectors wanted were haystacks. Pissarro may then have been inspired to replicate Monet\u2019s formula for success a year later in his own series of paintings. For both of these letters see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 60, 72.

As I explain there, The Harvest had only been known to scholars from photographs before entering a public collection in Tokyo. It is among a large number of major works by Pissarro in tempera, gouache, and pastel that remained uncatalogued since 1939. Joachim Pissarro published a reproduction of the work in color in 1993. Joachim Pissarro, Camille Pissarro (Abrams, 1993), p. 193.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 232, 234\u201336, 238\u201339.\n\nPDRS, vol. 1, pp. 229\u201330, 240, 243\u201346. Pissarro reported having eye problems as early as 1880. For his complaints about his failing eyesight, see Pissarro to Duret, Paris, Dec. 23, 1880, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), p. 140. According to Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s note 2 to this letter, Pissarro\u2019s infirmity began in 1878, affecting his left eye. The problem would plague him for the rest of his life.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, p. 245. The renovation work on Pissarro\u2019s studio began in June 1893 and was completed in late October of that year. On Pissarro\u2019s description of his studio and its windows facing specific cardinal points, see Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Aug. 27, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 359. For other details concerning Pissarro\u2019s studio renovations, see Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Oct. 17, 1893, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, p. 388. For Pissarro\u2019s installation of a printing press in his newly renovated studio, his excitement over it, and the amazing views from his studio window, see Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Jan. 3, 1894, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, p. 416. Since in a letter dated February 18, 1894, Pissarro complained to his son that he had had his fill of Bazincourt views, it is safe to assume that he had a clear view of the landscape stretching far beyond his property. See Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, p. 431.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 236\u201337.\n\nThe slogan \u201cLa propri\u00e9t\u00e9, c\u2019est le vol!\u201d (Property is theft!) was coined by Pierre-Joseph Prudhon in his book Qu\u2019est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9? (J.-F. Brocard, 1840), pp. 1\u20132. For an English translation, see Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, What Is Property?, ed. and trans. Donald R. Kelley and Bonnie G. Smith (Cambridge University Press, 1993), pp. 13\u201314.\n\nPDRS, vol. 1, p. 237. For Pissarro\u2019s letter to Monet and his reply, see Pissarro to Monet, London, June 3, 1892, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 236\u201337. For Pissarro\u2019s torment over Julie asking Monet for the loan, see Camille to Julie Pissarro, London, June 17, 1892, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, pp. 239\u201340.\n\nFor the gouache and etching, see PDRS, vol. 3, pp. 566\u201367. They are linked to PDRS 866 (fig. 1 in the present entry), a painting that was the inspiration for PDRS 951 (Haymaking at \u00c9ragny; 1892).\n\nAs early as 1882 Pissarro\u2019s painting had been criticized as peinture en relief (relief painting). For Andr\u00e9\u2019s review, dated March 7, 1882, describing Pissarro\u2019s relief painting technique see, Ruth Berson, ed., The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 1, Reviews (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 383.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s experimentation with pointillism and color division, see James Henry Rubin, \u201cReassessment and Renewal: The Neo-Impressionist Critique,\u201d in Impressionism (Phaidon, 1999), pp. 308\u201326. See also Anthea Callen, Techniques of the Impressionists (Chartwell, 2001), pp. 138\u201341.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s criticisms of late 1893, see Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Nov. 17, 1893; Paris, November 23, 1893; \u00c9ragny, Dec. 10, 1893; and Paris, December 23, 1893, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 397\u201399, 400, 407\u201308, 411\u201312.\n\nAlthough the work was not completed rapidly overall, each of the two phases in which it was created was likely very short.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper-right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper-left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests the dark blue of the signature is a mixture containing mostly cobalt blue with some red lake. Cobalt identified by XRF.

In addition, a thinly applied sizing layer could have been absorbed by the canvas and may not be visible under the current circumstances. Cross-sectional analysis would be needed to confirm the presence of a sizing layer.\n\nVisual analysis of cross sections suggests the ground is a single layer. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nStrong primary scalloping along this side, seen in the thread-angle map, corroborates this theory. Thread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods indicated: lead white, zinc white, vermilion, cobalt blue, chrome yellow, iron-oxide red and/or yellow, emerald green, and possible viridian (XRF); cobalt violet (XRF, Raman); madder lake (SERS). XRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments (including lake pigments and carbon blacks), if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (components of ultramarine blue).

Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture was found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. This mixture was also identified in Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870 cat. 3), The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat.8), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), and The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13).\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings.

Some works, such as The Village of Eragny (1885; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford [PDRS 794]) feature a typed note from Pissarro\u2019s daughter-in-law Esther expressing both Lucien and Camille\u2019s general distaste for varnish. On the verso of Landscape at Chaponval (1880; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [PDRS 624 (as Landscape at Valhermeil, Auvers-sur-Oise)]), the artist wrote \u201cplease do not varnish this picture / C. Pissarro\u201d. For discussion of Pissarro\u2019s varnishing practices see Michael Swicklick, \u201cFrench Painting and the use of Varnish, 1750\u20131900,\u201d Conservation Research: Studies in the History of Art 41, vol. 2 (1993), pp. 168\u201369.
