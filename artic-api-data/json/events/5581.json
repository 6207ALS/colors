    "description": "<p>Enjoy a full day of member-only access to <a href=\"/exhibitions/9869/gio-swaby-fresh-up\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Gio Swaby: Fresh Up</em></a>.</p><p>Gio Swaby is a multidisciplinary artist whose textile-based practice explores the intersections of Blackness and womanhood. Her embroidered portraits are anchored in the connections she forges with her subjects: each portrait begins with a photo shoot in which her sitters are captured in moments of self-awareness and empowerment. In her textile interpretations of the photographs, she foregrounds hair, clothing, and jewelry, highlighting and celebrating personal style as an unapologetic form of self-definition and self-expression grounded in liberatory love. </p><p>Simply show your member card or digital member card to enter.
