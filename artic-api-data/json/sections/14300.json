So much so, in fact, that Bits of Old Chelsea, a collection of etchings and poetic descriptions of the area\u2019s landmarks published in 1894, dedicated a chapter to \u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s House,\u201d noting that \u201c[a]s an inhabitant of Chelsea, Mr. Whistler\u2019s name is connected with Lindsey Row, Tite Street, The Vale, and elsewhere.\u201d According to one estimate, the artist spent almost thirty years of his life there.\n\nChelsea equally became a fixture of Whistler\u2019s art. Early in his career, Whistler\u2019s Chelsea environs and the busy life of the Thames River that ran alongside it inspired numerous oil paintings (including Grey and Silver: Old Battersea Reach, cat. 7), etchings, lithographs, and drawings. In the 1880s and 1890s, he created a series of watercolors, small oil paintings, etchings, and lithographs of neighborhood storefronts. Whereas he undertook his earlier paintings of Chelsea within the controlled environment of his studio, he executed the new oils and watercolors on-site. His student Mortimer Menpes, who accompanied Whistler on some of these painting expeditions, described the usual procedure: \u201cWhistler would get his little pochade box, and together we would drift out into the open,\u2013\u2013on to the Embankment, or down a side street in Chelsea,\u2013\u2013and he would make a little sketch, sometimes in water, sometimes in oil colour. It might be a fish shop with eels for sale at so much a plate, and a few soiled children in the foreground; or perhaps a sweet-stuff shop, and the children standing with their faces glued to the pane. There we would stay and paint until luncheon time, sitting on rush-bottomed chairs borrowed from the nearest shop.\u201d\n\nBy the 1890s Chelsea was a prosperous community, with most of its population consisting of middle-class families. Nevertheless, as Anna Gruetzner Robins has shown, pockets of poverty persisted, and the streets Whistler generally chose to depict in his shop-front series were among the neighborhood\u2019s poorest. This deliberate emphasis on ordinary spaces and the day-to-day activities of the area\u2019s less bourgeois inhabitants echoed Whistler\u2019s approach in his Venice series of 1879\u201380. This connection was noticed by the Pennells, who describe how Whistler harnessed watercolor in particular during this period to \u201crecord subjects as characteristic of London as the subject of his pastels were of Venice.\u201d\n\nWhistler\u2019s experiments in Venice informed not only his choice of subject matter but also his technique. Similar to pastel and etching, his primary media in Venice, watercolor is highly portable, a traditional medium for working outdoors. Whistler\u2019s use of watercolor greatly accelerated after his return from Italy in 1880 alongside a renewed interest in plein air painting and a fresh enthusiasm for creating small-scale finished works aroused by the Venice series. The medium also lent itself to the artist\u2019s continued explorations of surface effects and reductive compositions. As he had done\u2013\u2013to radical effect\u2013\u2013with Venetian architecture in the Venice pastels (see, for example, Corte del Paradiso [cat. 22]), Whistler interpreted his painted storefronts as flat planes of color and geometric forms. In Chelsea Shop, the composition is dominated by the three large rectangles formed by the window, door, and the ambiguous light-blue space to their right. The rectangular form is repeated many times throughout the composition, recurring in the windowpanes, benches, and architectural features described in a dark wash near the top of the facing buildings. The flatness of Whistler\u2019s forms is underscored by his thin layers of watercolor, which often allow earlier brushstrokes to show through underneath. This is the case in the skirt of the central female figure, for example, and in the white dress of the small child held by another figure at left. Though a cluttered collection of bottles and other objects is displayed in the store\u2019s window, Whistler does not provide enough visual information to enable the viewer to discern the type of shop or even what wares are on offer. Here, and throughout the composition, details have been gently effaced, leaving behind anonymous figures and loosely defined objects that together create a generalized impression of the scene.\n\nChelsea Shop and Whistler\u2019s other late Chelsea works grew out of a long career spent exploring ways to distill the real world into its aesthetic components. As the writers of Bits of Old Chelsea describe, \u201c[Whistler] has labored to express all varieties of beautiful colour and form, as the river, the streets, the stones of Chelsea, gave them to his sense of beauty: a veritable \u2018incantation.\u2019\u201d Whistler\u2019s Chelsea scenes indeed cast a kind of magic spell over his beloved London home, revealing to the world the abstract beauty underpinning its everyday reality.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Chelsea Shop corresponds to Margaret F.
