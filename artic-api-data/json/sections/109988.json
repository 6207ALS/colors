    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">Part of the upended hot-air balloon from sheet 3B enters this sheet from the left. A number of wranglers, tethered to the balloon by ropes, fly through the space, while an enormous octopus\u2014part of the biological debris that fills the sky\u2014floats by. Connections exist between this sheet and the adjacent ones, but various details suggest they were created separately. For example, although the clouds continue to the adjacent sheet, 3D, Ensor created these in the present sheet with broad cross-hatching, whereas in 3D he used fine, parallel lines. This contrast in handling implies the two sheets were not conceived as a unit. Similarly, only one of the octopus\u2019s tentacles extends down into sheet 4C, rather superficially. Thus it appears to be a later addition, made to link otherwise independent compositions. SMC/KJN\n\nThe action in sheets 3A, 3B, 3C, 4A, 4B, and 4C is the source of the engraving Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels (fig. 1). It also indirectly inspired other etchings, such as The Terrible Archer (fig. 2), Cataclysms (fig. 3), Wizards in a Squall (fig. 4), and The Elephant\u2019s Joke (fig. 5). Although Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels is not a direct reproduction of these sheets, the chaotic composition and frightful elements are similar to Saint Anthony\u2019s torments. Many motifs appear in both the print and the drawing, for example, the hot-air balloon, train, sawfish, headless bodies, octopi, insects, elephant, and submarine.\n\nIn the drawing the chaos is somewhat contained by the use of schematic registers, but in the etching Ensor dispensed with the organizational structure and allowed the chaos to become overwhelming. Sources of inspiration for the chaos include The Fall of the Rebel Angels by Pieter Bruegel I (fig. 6); versions of the temptation after Pieter Bruegel (fig. 7), by Martin Schongauer (fig. 8), and by Jacques Callot (fig. 9); and battle scenes by the Japanese artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada (fig. 10 and fig. 11). These artists provided ideas about overlapping, clashing compositions that Ensor assimilated into his own work. He interpreted these sources to offer viewers a distilled representation that condenses the energy, imagination, anxiety, and virulence of its predecessors. Thanks to this synthesis, the image possesses its own logic and magic that captivates even as it amuses and overwhelms viewers with its detail. ST\n\nfig. 1 James Ensor (Belgian, 1860\u20131949).
