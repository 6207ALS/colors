A large solar array was installed and straw bale buildings were constructed, including Sister Miriam\u2019s house.\n\nAt the heart of Genesis Farm is a commitment to the teachings of Catholic eco-theologian Thomas Berry. His doctrine, Earth Literacy, is based on the belief that the divine is revealed in the vast biological and cultural diversity of this planet.\n\nBerry was one of the first to propose the idea that the Earth\u2019s environmental crisis stems from a spiritual crisis. He maintains that we suffer from a kind of spiritual autism, that we no longer feel our kinship with other life on this planet. The challenge now is to satisfy our essential human needs without destroying the biodiversity that makes our world so nourishing and rich. Central to the doctrine of Earth Literacy is the conviction that any viable future for the human species is dependent upon the viability of the Earth.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
