    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: So, here you have a wonderful example of the evolution of his work. In the canvas on the left, Gauguin is still influenced by the conventions of Impressionism: you see it in the light, feathery brushwork and the soft, blended colors. But, when makes Vision of the Sermon, on the right in that same here, his style has changed drastically. The same Breton women are no longer in an easily understandable narrative that now they're very symbolic. They represent the sort of meditative trance that they are in as they pray and what they're seeing in their praying, which is the vision of Jacob wrestling the angel.</p>\n<p>And you have this wonderful, transcendent view of the reality, which is in the foreground. And then, what they are seeing in their hallucinatory state of prayer in the background. And he's put the tree to kind of divide that which is real and that which is imaginary. And then, this cow just appears as a kind of emblematic device, but at the same time, it helps the decorative overall patterning and it's very flat. It\u2019s a style he developed through his work in ceramics, where designs have to be outlined with incised lines so that the color glazes don\u2019t bleed and mix together during the firing. So, you went from the very broken brush strokes, that featheriness of a semi-Impressionist, on the left, to a work with flat, solid zones of color that come out of his work in ceramics. It's a completely different aesthetic from what he was doing in that same year. He's moved into a different realm.</p>\n",
