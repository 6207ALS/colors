    "transcript": "<p>Sasash: Hello, my name is Sasash  and I am a member of Teen Council. The stop you're about to hear was inspired by Salvador Dali's belief in dreams being central to human thought and the experiences of soldiers during war.</p>\n<p>Narrator: You wake up to screams and laughter surrounding you &lt;laughter&gt; during the middle of what looks like the desert. There are people to your left at a table with trinkets admiring a statue of a woman sitting beside them. Not much else is visible, except for a shadow of a dog across from them. The fear you initially had only grows when you make eye contact with the woman whose face is waiting to split apart. Her hands, stripped away of all flesh reach out to you, 'Come. Come. Follow me. Follow me,' she says. Her other hand becomes visible holding an hourglass. 'We don't have much time, time, time.' As you walk along with her, you realize that you have walked this path before, not as a visitor, but as a soldier, destroyer. Your thoughts are interrupted when in the center you see mass figures with blue wings worshipping some higher power. You hear a scream. &lt;woman screams&gt; Women walking informally on all fours like animals look up to see you. In the distance the mountains are on fire. Innocent wildlife suffer as they burn. You ask yourself, 'What kind of nightmare is this? Why is this happening? Why is no one stopping it?' The woman tells you as if she had read your mind. 'You humans, your mortal gods have destroyed everything.' This is the Invention of the Monsters, Hell on Earth, Earth.&quot;</p>\n",
