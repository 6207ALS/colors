    "description": "<p>George Inness\u2019s <em>Catskill Mountains</em> depicts a land tamed by human presence. The church, the carefully tended fields, and the hayrick on the right are all finely delineated in a manner typical of Inness\u2019s early style. Although the artist\u2019s reverent handling of color and light in this image has often been linked to his interest in Swedenborgian spirituality, it also relates to his admiration for this particular expanse of the American landscape. During the mid-19th century, the Catskill Mountain range was America\u2019s premiere tourist site. The region\u2019s close proximity to urban centers and abundant spectacular views made the Catskills a popular destination for those who wanted to escape from the bustle of modern life.</p>\n",
