In the right half, the figures are minimally extended from folio 3H/I below, easing the visual transition between the parts. On the top edge, there is evidence of blue colored pencil and an absence of blue chalk, which reveals that the latter medium was applied after the sheet was mounted; it also shows that folio 1H/I, directly above, once overlapped this area.
