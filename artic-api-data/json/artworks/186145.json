At the center of the controversy surrounding the group, which now has about twenty-five hundred members in nine countries, is their belief in the corporal punishment of children. Spanking is considered God\u2019s remedy for disobedience, and when necessary it should be administered with a thin wooden dowel,\nproducing a stinging sensation in the admonished child, who should not cry and who should, upon completion of the process, thank the disciplining parent.\n\nAllegations of child abuse first surfaced in the early 1980s when a former member, Juan Mattatall, sought custody of his five children, who remained in the group with their mother. Despite substantial evidence of his pedophilia, Mattatall won the case. The children then spent much of their childhood in orphanages and foster homes, as their father was charged with sex crimes. His life ended in 1990 when his mother shot and killed him in order to stop the grief he was causing.\n\nIn June 1984, state troopers raided members\u2019 houses at Island Pond, seizing 112 children. When the matter came to court and no evidence of abuse was found, the children were returned to their parents. These occurrences and one or two other custody battles have created an environment of suspicion that plagues the Twelve Tribes Community around the world.\n\nReferring to the Mattatall case, the Religious Movements Project of the University of Virginia found it to be a demonstration of what can happen when raw fear, personal animosity and prejudice toward unconventional religious groups is allowed to run roughshod over law, religious tolerance and reason. Finding \u201cunequivocal evidence of a campaign to manufacture and disseminate misinformation about the group,\u201d the Project notes that almost every new religion experiences some level of conflict with the larger society. \u201cHow they balance the tension between their unique message and the suspicions of the broader culture will play a large role in determining whether they survive beyond a first generation of believers.\u201d\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
