    "title": "Midwest Masterpieces: The Sullivan Banks",
    "description": "In 1976 Crombie Taylor used then state-of-the-art multi-media slide projection technology to represent Louis Sullivan's eight Midwestern banks at architectural scale and with exquisite fidelity to their stunning polychromy. Now digitized, Taylor's program, together with his pioneering Sullivan building restorations and stencil exhibit, reveals a previously unknown Sullivan, a master of mass and volume, and a new starting point for our understanding of early modern architectural history.",
