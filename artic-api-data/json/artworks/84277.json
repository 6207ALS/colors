    "description": "<p>The second half of the 1700s was an age of great sentiment; tears flowed profusely in art and literature. Jean-Baptiste Greuze in particular capitalized on this cult of feeling.<br><em>The Paternal Blessing</em> was an illustration for a pictorial narrative by Greuze called <em>Bazile and Thibault</em>, or <em>The Two Educations</em>. It told the story of two brothers, one good and one bad. Reflecting theories of nature versus nurture espoused by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712\u201378), Bazile became a good man because he had been breast-fed as an infant at home, while Thibault became a bad man because he had been sent away to a wet nurse. Here, Bazile receives his father\u2019s blessing before setting out on his own.</p>\n",
