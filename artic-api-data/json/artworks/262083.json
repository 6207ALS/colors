    "description": "<p>This depiction of Mars was created with intaglio, one of the two primary gem-carving techniques used in the ancient world. The term derives from the Italian word intagliare, meaning \u201cto cut into or engrave,\u201d and describes the process by which an artist carved this image into the surface of the stone. The complementary technique, known as cameo, produced an image in relief (raised).Both this gem and the cameo on display nearby were pre-viously part of a collection in England formed in the 17th century by the Earl of Arundel. After being held together for more than 250 years, the gems were dispersed at auction in 1899\u2014only to be reunited in Chicago over 100 years later.</p>\n",
