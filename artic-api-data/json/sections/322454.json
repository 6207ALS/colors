Way, Whistler drew this nocturnal scene of men and women gathered at an outdoor caf\u00e9-chantant in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. It is something of a compositional pendant to T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate in the Garden (cat. 90), drawn at about the same time: both are images of casually grouped figures seated outdoors, and in both the artist experimented with different ways of using the white of the paper to represent light.\n\nIn T\u00eate-\u00e0-T\u00eate in the Garden, an overall suffusion of bright afternoon sunlight is evenly dappled with the cast shadows of surrounding foliage. In The Little Caf\u00e9 au Bois, Whistler rendered the effect of artificial illumination at night by assertively using the lithographic crayon to establish a complex, alternating pattern of light and dark. The contrast between the black jacket and white shirtfront worn by the waiter in the center of the image, for example, is echoed in the architecture of the bandstand at left and in the shadowy forest setting. There is a roughly indicated caf\u00e9 chair in the immediate foreground, and this area of the composition remains somewhat unresolved. Nevertheless, the artist was satisfied with the image. He mentioned in a mid-August letter to T. R. Way that he particularly liked it and two other images (cat. 93 and cat. 94), and asked if Thomas Way did not find them \u201cfine and very simple and direct?\u201d (letter 104).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream Japanese proofing paper (300 \u00d7 196 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (313 \u00d7 197 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory laid proofing paper (278 \u00d7 200 mm), signed.
