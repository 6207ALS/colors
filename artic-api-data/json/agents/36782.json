    "description": "<p>One of the most influential photographers of the 20th century, Edward Steichen was a groundbreaking innovator in the fields of art photography, aerial photography, and fashion and commercial photography</p><p>Steichen\u2019s artistic career began at the age of 16, when he apprenticed at a Milwaukee lithographic firm, creating photographs that were used as models for illustrated advertisements. Steichen then spent two years in Paris before moving to New York and opening a portrait studio in 1902. By then he was known for atmospheric photographs in the Pictorialist style\u2014an aesthetic that valued retouching and evident handicraft to create a \u201cpainterly\u201d effect, and that aimed to distinguish serious artists from amateur or merely professional photographers. He soon became the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Alfred Stieglitz, a pioneering photographer who championed photography\u2019s place among the modern fine arts. Together, they opened the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession (later known simply as \u201c291\u201d) and were the first to present Picasso, Br\u00e2ncusi, and a range of progressive photographers to the American public.&nbsp;</p><p>With his family, Steichen relocated to Voulangis, France, in 1906, where he immersed himself in European modern art. They remained there until the outbreak of World War I in 1914. In 1917, Steichen entered active duty with the goal of becoming \u201ca photographic reporter, as Mathew Brady had been in the Civil War,\u201d but quickly abandoned this romantic notion to help implement the newest weapon of war\u2014aerial photography. Steichen was assigned to the newly formed Photographic Section and promoted to commanding officer during the war\u2019s critical final battles. Steichen presided over training programs, darkroom operations, print distribution, and supply channels. Although he likely participated in several test flights, there is no evidence that Steichen took operational photographs himself during the war.</p><p>When Steichen returned to New York in 1923, he assumed two positions that would make him the best-known and highest-paid commercial photographer of his time: chief photographer for Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s <em>Vogue </em>and <em>Vanity Fair</em> magazines and consultant for the J. Walter Thompson advertising company. Steichen immediately embraced celebrity, fashion, and advertising photography. At Cond\u00e9 Nast, Steichen began to use artificial light sources, high contrast, sharp focus, and geometric backgrounds\u2014techniques borrowed from fine-art and stage photography\u2014which gave his images a fresh, unprecedentedly modernist feel. Steichen\u2019s greatest accomplishment was to blur the lines between celebrity portraiture, fashion photography, and advertising, creating a hybrid genre of images with a potent mix of glamour and desire that dominates magazine photography to this day.</p><p>Later in his career, Steichen became an influential impresario, promoting photography as a  tool of mass media while retaining his fierce dedication to craft. He upheld these views as head of the photography department at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, from 1947 to 1962.&nbsp;</p><p>Explore Steichen\u2019s extensive career in photography in <a href=\"https://archive.artic.edu/steichen/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">this archive</a>, which includes&nbsp;a rare World War I album. </p>",
