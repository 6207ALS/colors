The Art Institute\u2019s sculpture is one of six smaller bronze versions of the unique, over-16-foot-long marble figure that Moore installed at UNESCO in 1958. The artist looked to many cultures\u2014particularly to enduring examples of art from ancient Greece and the Yucat\u00e1n region of Mexico\u2014to give his figural works their monumental forms and profound resonance with the art of the past. This reclining figure connects not only to history but also to the earth\u2014its swelling masses and rounded voids suggest the female form as well as a landscape of valleys, mountains, and caves.</p>\n",
