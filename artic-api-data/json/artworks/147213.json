Six people were  killed and over one thousand were injured. The bombing was alleged to be part of a larger plot intended to force the United States Government to cease its support of Israel and Egypt; other targets included the United Nations, the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, and the main Federal Office Building in Manhattan. \n\nA serial number from a truck axle found in the wreckage led investigators to followers of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, a fundamentalist Islamic leader. Four men were found guilty of the World Trade Center bombing, and ten were convicted in the larger conspiracy of urban terrorism, including Rahman. Chemicals used to build the bomb were stored at this facility.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
