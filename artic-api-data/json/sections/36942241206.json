(n\u00e9e Mary Foster Southwell; 1861\u20131954) Worcester donated seventy paintings, drawings, and sculptures from their collection to the Art Institute of Chicago. Longtime patrons of the museum, the Worcesters had supported the Art Institute in significant ways for many years prior to this gift. They had loaned parts of their collection for exhibition and had generously supported the museum\u2019s programming efforts, donating a fund to support the educational Gallery of Art Interpretation and contributing to the children\u2019s fund. The Worcesters, who began donating important works of art to the Art Institute by 1925, collected broadly with the museum in mind; their 1947 donation\u2014much of which stayed in their 1323 North State Street home until they died\u2014included European and American works from the fourteenth to the twentieth century. According to former Art Institute curator and director Daniel Catton Rich: \u201cIn 1926, after a certain number of paintings had been acquired, Mr. and Mrs. Worcester indicated to Mr. Robert B. Harshe, Director of The Art Institute of Chicago, that they generously wished to contribute to the collections of the Institute. \u2018What did the Museum need?\u2019 \u2018In what fields should it be strengthened?\u2019 Together with Mr. Harshe they surveyed the Department of Paintings and . . . they set out at once to supply these lacks.\u201d\n\nIn addition to their collecting efforts, the Worcesters volunteered extensive service to the Art Institute. Having become a member in 1897, Mr. Worcester\u2014a leader in the lumber and paper-product industries\u2014went on to serve as a trustee (1925\u201349), vice president (1932\u201337), and honorary president (1938\u201356) (fig. 2). Originally from Detroit, Michigan, he was also an amateur painter (fig. 3). Mrs. Worcester\u2014born in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin, where her grandparents were founding settlers and she (as well as her parents) supported many local institutions, especially the town\u2019s public library\u2014was an honorary member of the Art Institute\u2019s Woman\u2019s Board. A supporter of many causes, Mrs. Worcester bequeathed approximately $5 million of her estate to numerous charities. The Art Institute continues to benefit from the Worcesters\u2019 philanthropy. Upon their deaths, they left the museum significant acquisition funds that have been used to purchase important Impressionist paintings such as Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s Paris Street; Rainy Day, acquired by the Art Institute in 1964 (fig. 4).\n\nBoats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat (cat. 22)\n\nThe Laundress (cat. 6)\n\nLa couseuse (Femme cousant dans un jardin) (The Seamstress [Woman Sewing in a Garden])\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Charles H.
