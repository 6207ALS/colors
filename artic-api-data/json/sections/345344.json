According to [glossary:T. R. Way (1912)], Whistler recorded this view of the manager\u2019s window at the back of the Gaiety Theatre from the first floor of the Way printing offices at 21 Wellington Street. The subject was repeated in an 1896 lithograph drawn on transfer paper (cat. 150).\n\nWhistler returned to Paris in early March 1895, leaving with the Ways the stones bearing the Gaiety Theatre view and the portrait of Lady Haden. More than two months later, in mid-May, the printers finally processed the stone and printed the first proofs of Back of the Gaiety Theatre. On May 15 T. R. Way wrote to Whistler: \u201cI have now sent proofs of the drawing you were making from the office window, we kept it hoping you might return . . . but finding that you did not do so and being anxious that it should not be destroyed, we proved it. Father is very enthusiastic, I like it very much too, what do you say?\u201d (letter 135). There was no reply from Paris, and Way wrote again on July 15 (letter 136). Whistler finally responded on July 22, saying that he did not share the printers\u2019 regard for the lithographs he had produced during his stay in London and that he wished \u201cevery trace of that sad visit removed\u201d (letter 137). He went on to instruct the Ways to \u201cwipe out at once the Ly. Haden\u2014The view out of the window in Wellington Street\u2014and whatever else I had the folly to think I was doing when really all my thoughts were elsewhere.\u201d\n\nThe printers must have followed Whistler\u2019s instructions to erase the stone, for only a few proofs of this lithograph have survived. Three of the known impressions belonged to either T. R. Way or his father, indicating that they printed and retained proofs for themselves. Despite his poor opinion of Back of the Gaiety Theatre, Whistler was at some point willing to sign at least two impressions in graphite.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (384 \u00d7 250 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG, cream laid paper (383 \u00d7 253 mm), signed. London: BM, grayish white chine (281 \u00d7 232 mm) mounted on white plate paper (431 \u00d7 321 mm). Washington: FGA, grayish ivory chine (282 \u00d7 230 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (396 \u00d7 343 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another impression is found in Cleveland, CMA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
