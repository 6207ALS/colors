    "description": "<p>Art Insights provides a historical and enlightening art-enrichment experience for older members of the community who are unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's Museums at Home series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based Art Insights conversations on a national scale. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>Portraits have endured as a common art form for centuries. Each work reflects an artist\u2019s unique style, perspective, and objective, as they endeavor to represent an individual. In this presentation, we will explore the range of portraiture at the Art Institute of Chicago, from painting to photography to abstract representation, spanning centuries of artistic expression. Join Art Insights volunteer presenter Paula Dlesk as we discuss how artists capture more than the appearance of their subjects.</p><p>This virtual presentation is hosted by Well Connected, a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who connect via phone- or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p><p>For more information or to register, please call (877) 797-7299, email <a href=\"mailto:coviaconnections@covia.org\">coviaconnections@covia.org</a>, or visit&nbsp;<a href=\"covia.org/services/well-connected\">covia.org/services/well-connected</a>.</p>",
