Wall revetment fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished on the face. The fragment preserves two adjacent oblique sides of an inlay; the top edge appears to be original but may have been grozed or trimmed; the right and bottom edges are broken. In a dark-emerald-green matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from densely packed segments of a single deep-greenish-yellow cane of irregular section.\n\nThe fragment is considerably thicker than many of the other examples. The face has been repolished; the edges and back are heavily pitted with a creamy iridescent weathering crust.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 97 Fragment of a Wall Revetment, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
