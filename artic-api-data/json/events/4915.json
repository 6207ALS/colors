    "short_description": "<p>Toronto-based, Colombian-born interdisciplinary musician and artist-curator Lido Pimienta, whose album <em>La Papessa</em> won Canada\u2019s Polaris Music Prize, performs at the Art Institute of Chicago. Powered by glittering synths and influenced by Afro-Colombian singing and drumming styles, Pimienta\u2019s deeply political music and multimedia work is informed by her identity as an immigrant, an Afro-indigenous person, and an intersectional feminist. Her live shows are famously interactive, as she rearranges her audience to allow women of color to the front.</p><p>The performance is presented in connection with the Art Institute's Arts of the Americas collection. Artists Connect is a performance series that highlights the creative process. Artists, poets, dancers, and musicians engage with works of art, making connections to their own practice and inspiring new ways of understanding the Art Institute's collection.</p>",
