    "short_description": "Collage is commonly thought of as a modern art form, but the act of \u201cplaying with pictures\u201d has a long, rich, and surprising history. Sixty years ahead of the avant-garde\u2014and more than a century before Photoshop\u2014aristocratic Victorian women were already experimenting with photocollage. This world-premiere exhibition is the first to comprehensively examine this little-known phenomenon, presenting many eye-opening works that have rarely\u2014and in many cases never\u2014before been displayed or reproduced.",
