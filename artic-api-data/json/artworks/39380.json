The image on paper is then transferred to the stone's surface. The <em>Douze Croquis </em> embodied the aesthetic of the lithography revival of the 1870s, when lithography was seen as a means to multiply drawings rather than as a medium to be exploited for its own unique resources. This portfolio was one of the first to be marketed in a limited edition (of 50), which gave the publication the cachet of &quot;rarity&quot; and also ensured uniformly high printing quality.</p>\n",
