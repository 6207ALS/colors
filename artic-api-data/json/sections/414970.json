The artist\u2019s choice of this particular spot\u2014and his way of approaching it\u2014suggest that he was interested in continuing his ongoing studies of perspective, which included recent paintings such as The Pont de l\u2019Europe (1876; Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais, Geneva [Berhaut 1978, no. 44; Berhaut 1994, no. 49]) and The House Painters (1877; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Berhaut 1978, no. 48; Berhaut 1994, no. 53]). While we cannot know exactly what types of perspectival drawing or techniques for depicting space Caillebotte may have explored before working on these canvases, there are many ways in which he could have absorbed this kind of knowledge\u2014from manuals such as Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes\u2019s \u00c9l\u00e9mens de perspective pratique \u00e0 l\u2019usage des artistes or during his brief period at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. He might even have extracted some tips from his friend, the trained engineer Maurice Brault.\n\nIt is helpful first to compare Caillebotte\u2019s definitive Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day\u201d to a related sketch that shares many of its traits. View from rue de Madrid toward rue de Lisbonne (fig. 1.3) is often mentioned as a preparatory drawing of an alternate setting for the painting. It is similar to Study for \u201cParis Street\u201d in its basic construction, which includes a compressed foreground with a constraining sidewalk and a nearby building jutting in on one side\u2014a space that is complemented by a dynamic perspective view into the far distance. It is possible that this setting, with its narrow foreground and single plunge into deep space, helped pique Caillebotte\u2019s interest in the exciting push and pull of near and far, prompting his final choice of a different, more complex site that offered both a larger intersection and a greater opportunity to explore depth and perspective as they manifested themselves on the new streets of Haussmann\u2019s Paris.\n\nIt is clear that, at some point, Caillebotte chose to set aside View from rue de Madrid and his other studies of that site, focusing on Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day\u201d alone as the main setting for the painting. As we shall see, the sketch is remarkable in a number of ways. First, as has long been recognized, it is a highly accurate representation of the intersection. Second, it contains both a raw, on-site sketch and a second series of reinforced lines that illustrate how Caillebotte adjusted the perspective, slightly shifting the point of view and creating a stable blueprint that he could transfer directly to the canvas. Third, it helps us understand that many crucial elements that make the final painting so compelling\u2014the presence of large figures close to the picture plane, the push-pull of the compressed foreground space and plunging perspective views, and the immersive effect that results from placing the scene at a viewer\u2019s-eye level\u2014were established surprisingly early on.\n\nStudy for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day\u201d is primarily an architectural and perspectival study. In the left foreground, for instance, the artist fit the width of the cobblestones to the orthogonal lines leading down the rue de Turin into the distance, illustrating his early interest in reproducing them in perspective (fig. 1.4). Caillebotte also began to explore a few isolated details, including the kiosk-sized rectangular shape with a sloping top that is visible just to the right of the left-hand building. In the middle and far distance, he introduced provisional indications of small figures who appear as vertical squiggles roughly in the spots they occupy in the final painting. The important foreground figures have yet to appear but are clearly suggested by the large arched shape at center right, whose faint scallops reveal it to be an umbrella. The large size of the umbrella suggests that, from the beginning, Caillebotte intended his foreground figure\u2014or figures\u2014to confront the viewer on the sidewalk and planned to contrast their closeness with deep perspective views of their urban setting.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, in this preparatory drawing Caillebotte combined two stages of his working process: an initial on-site sketch and a second step in which he clarified the perspective with a series of ruled and reangled lines. This was a necessary action, as it helped to create a stable, easily reproducible blueprint that could be enlarged and used as the basic skeleton for the underdrawing in the final painting. Because of the single vantage of the chosen setting, Caillebotte\u2019s clarifying of the scene took place right on top of the raw sketch. Perhaps in part because of the visual confusion that resulted, little attention has been paid to the inherent differences between the two sets of lines that are present on this sheet. To truly analyze the artist\u2019s treatment of the site, we have attempted to isolate Caillebotte\u2019s original sketch on the rue de Turin by digitally minimizing his ruled lines (see fig. 1.5).\n\nWhat is immediately striking about the initial sketch is its broad angle of view on the one hand and the small size of the background elements on the other; these are part of the oft-cited wide-angle effect seen in the final painting and suggest that this work was made with an optical drawing aid (see cat. 2, Curatorial Entry). The sheet\u2019s small, portable size reinforces the sense the image itself gives us, which is that Caillebotte created the sketch on the rue de Turin sidewalk. Crucially, the lines themselves appear not to be carefully traced on the thick paper but are rather sketchy. Moreover, when comparing the initial lines of the architecture to the straight, solid lines added at the regularizing stage, we can see that they are more steeply angled, suggesting a lower initial vantage point. A recent re-creation of this process by Pablo Garcia, Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, has revealed that the on-site sketch was probably created with the aid of a camera lucida and that the vantage point was on the sidewalk, approximately fifty inches off the ground, or the approximate height of the artist standing with his head bent down (see cat. 2, Curatorial Entry and fig. 1.6).\n\nOnce the on-site sketch was finished, Caillebotte would have taken it back to his studio. There, he overlaid the initial freehand drawing with a second, more deliberate set of lines to simplify and systematize the composition, enabling its transfer to the final canvas without the use of a grid. The first step was to adjust the perspective, establishing a horizon as a reference line from which the various architectural orthogonals could radiate. Determining the horizon would have been complicated by many factors, not the least of which was the slope of the streetscape: both the rue de Turin and the rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg slope upward. This would mean not only that Caillebotte was looking at his view uphill but that the entire ground line of the composition was lower at the bottom left corner of the work and higher at the upper right.\n\nAfter closely examining Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day,\u201d we were able to suggest how Caillebotte took the on-site sketch, simplified it, and rationalized its perspective. Not surprisingly, the artist eventually settled on a flat horizon, revising the right-to-left slope of the intersection. To deduce the horizon, he probably used the lines of second building (housing the Pharmacie), as it is the only one in the scene of which both sides are clearly visible receding into space. To the left of this structure, Garcia identified a small tick mark just below the current horizon; on the right, he discovered a corresponding mark, somewhat camouflaged by the lamppost, that is just above the horizon. If one draws horizontal lines from each of these tick marks, the final horizon is exactly centered between them (fig. 1.7).\n\nAfter determining the horizon, it appears that Caillebotte extended it lightly across the sheet with a hard pencil and began establishing new vanishing points with short hatch marks across it (see Compositional Development in the technical report). In general, the new vanishing points change the angles of the buildings slightly so they are less steep, making the overall point of view seem higher than it was originally (see fig. 1.8). In the case of the second building, for example, a small diagonal hatch across the horizon at the far left serves as a new, slightly higher vanishing point for the left side. For the right, the artist added a small X on the horizon line just to the right of the lamppost in order to serve both this building and the one across the street. In his treatment of the foreground, however, Caillebotte adopted a different strategy in which he unified the complex perspectival relationships at play in the intersection. For instance, the larger X clearly visible farther to the right of the lamppost serves as an invented, common vanishing point for not only the far left and far right buildings but also the foreground sidewalk and the cobblestones. Strictly speaking, these elements should have two vanishing points between them. These basic changes, which are very small adjustments on the level of the drawing, produce major differences in the viewer\u2019s experience of the final painting. There, as we shall see, the overall effect is one of greater immediacy, as we encounter the streetscape at eye level rather than at chest level, as we did in the initial sketch, and are placed right on the sidewalk, enveloped in the foreground.\n\nAs Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day\u201d has shown us, Caillebotte was deeply invested in the use of perspective to capture the architectural atmosphere of his chosen site. While he employed it, however, he also manipulated it, adjusting his initial sketch on the rue de Turin in order to achieve the results he was seeking. This drawing was the beginning of a working process that was\u2014and continued to be\u2014dynamic. Although the artist used it to establish many important features of the final painting, it represents not the end of his thinking, but rather the beginning of yet another stage of explorations and adjustments that took place on the canvas. But before he could execute such bold changes, the artist used this sketch to create an architectural stage set capable of enveloping painted figures and viewers alike.  \nKelly Keegan\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Caillebotte drew most of this scene on-site using a soft graphite pencil on tan, moderately thick, moderately textured, handmade laid paper. Following this initial sketch, he added ruled graphite lines with a harder, finer pencil. Employing charcoal and working freehand, he lowered and adjusted the line indicating the top of the composition. Numerous tiny yet distinct indentations in the paper, visible only with a high-powered microscope, are present throughout the composition. These indentations were created by the use of a measuring device such as a pair of calipers. The toolmarks represent Caillebotte\u2019s method for transferring the architectural perspective and vanishing points from the drawing onto canvas for his monumental oil painting Paris Street; Rainy Day of 1877 (cat. 2).\n\nGraphite is the primary drawing medium for this composition. Caillebotte used soft graphite pencils in the freehand portion of the drawing and harder graphite pencils for his ruled lines. Charcoal, a minor component of this sketch, was employed only in the lower of two horizontal margin lines that frame the top of the composition and in a few short horizontal strokes through the lamppost, which are located approximately 5 mm below the charcoal margin line.\n\nTransmitted light (fig. 1.9) reveals the laid and chain pattern of the paper. There are 8 laid lines per 10 mm, and the horizontal chain lines are spaced 29 mm apart. The paper was fabricated on a double-faced papermaking mold widely in use by the nineteenth century. Small losses to the paper appear white in transmitted light. The round, semitransparent spot in the lower section of the paper was caused by a drop of water falling onto the moist sheet just after it was formed, causing the wet fibers to disperse and creating this imperfection in the finished sheet. This mistake by the papermaker is referred to as a papermaker\u2019s tear. It is possible that the artist composed this sketch on half of a full sheet. Normally, handmade paper has four deckle edges; in this case, the left, right, and bottom of the sheet have the feathery edges caused by the pulp flowing between the frame and the deckle of the mold, but the top edge does not. This edge appears to have been folded and then torn. In transmitted light, the three feathery edges appear white, as they allow more light to pass through the sheet.\n\n302 \u00d7 465 mm.\n\nThere are several numerical notations in graphite in the left and lower margins of the drawing. On the upper left, the inscription appears to be either 110 or 11\u00b0; below this and oriented 90 degrees counterclockwise is 120 or 12\u00b0 (fig. 1.10). On the lower part of the left margin, the notation appears to be either 01 2 or \u00b01 2, and along the lower ruled graphite margin 2/.62 or ~ 1.62 (fig. 1.11). Alternatively, the notation along the lower ruled margin may read 29 \u00bd when the drawing is inverted (fig. 1.12). For comparison, see the graphite numerical notations on sheets 39 and 40 in Caillebotte\u2019s Sketchbook (fig. 1.13 and fig. 1.14, cat. 4).\n\nMost of this architectural composition was drawn freehand using a soft graphite pencil. When the artist applied greater pressure, the pencil lines became very dark, shiny, and compressed into the paper. Examples of this are found in the curve of the sidewalk, the bottom of the lamppost, the paving stones, and the tops of the zigzag marks representing figures (fig. 1.15).\n\nThe freehand portion of the drawing so accurately depicts the site as seen from the rue de Turin that some scholars have suggested Caillebotte employed photography or an optical drawing aid such as the camera lucida or the tent camera obscura. Recent research at the Art Institute of Chicago, however, has ruled out the use of photography and demonstrated that the artist probably used a camera lucida while drawing on-site (see cat. 2, Curatorial Entry, and fig. 1.6).\n\nRuled lines made with a harder graphite pencil were applied over certain freehand strokes in the buildings in order to adjust the perspective; these are especially noticeable in (from left to right) the second, third, and sixth buildings. Other ruled lines include the margin lines that frame or crop the composition, some of the diagonal lines in the cobblestone street, and the very faintly drawn horizon line. Infrared imaging (fig. 1.16) makes the fainter graphite lines and details easier to read; for example, the horizon line can be seen across the entire drawing, and the scalloped underside of the umbrella becomes more evident. Even the tiny tip of the umbrella is visible (fig. 1.17).\n\nThe horizon line extends beyond the left and right margin lines by 2 mm on the left and 20 mm on the right, ending at a small hole in the right margin. The artist established vanishing points along the horizon line for the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth buildings from the left, and for lines in the cobblestone street, using a variety of diagonal, vertical, and cross marks in graphite.\n\nPortions of the drawing extend to the edges of the sheet, including the graphite lines in the building on the far right and the diagonal lines in the street and the curved sidewalk. Caillebotte cropped his composition with ruled graphite lines, excluding a portion of the foreground and some graphite lines of the two buildings on the far right (fig. 1.18). The lamppost is centered between the left and right graphite crop lines. At a later point, the artist made a small but important change: he lowered the top of the composition by another quarter of an inch, using charcoal and drawing freehand. This second cropping excludes a bit more of the two buildings on the far right as well as the top of the lamppost. Caillebotte may have contemplated more cropping of the lamppost, as indicated by some additional charcoal marks in this area. The horizon line is now equidistant from the bottom ruled graphite line and the hand-drawn charcoal line, 130 mm from each. The artist erased or rubbed away graphite lines in the cobblestones. This subtraction of the graphite medium softens the appearance of the stones and suggests a wet surface. The graphite zigzag marks in the drawing are placeholders for potential figures in the oil painting. The oversize umbrella in the drawing prefigures the foreground couple and umbrella in the painting.\n\nThe notion of the drawing as a road map for the monumental painting grew from the discovery, through the use of a powerful microscope, of an extensive number of tiny but distinct indentation marks throughout the drawing. The marks are not uniform in appearance: some are circular, while others are elongated, and a few appear as scratches in the surface. Both singular and clustered indentation marks are present in the sheet (fig. 1.19, fig. 1.20, fig. 1.21, fig. 1.22, fig. 1.23). These appear to be toolmarks and are present in fifty-seven locations throughout the drawing (fig. 1.24). Toolmarks are found on the horizon line and through the center of the lamppost, dividing the drawing into four quadrants (fig. 1.25). Several tool marks on the horizon line are found on top of select vanishing points for buildings and lines in the street (fig. 1.26).\n\nAt the top of the composition, toolmarks are present not only in the lower charcoal margin line, which crops the top of the lamppost, but also in the additional strokes of the charcoal lines below. No toolmarks were found in the upper graphite margin line, suggesting that Caillebotte had abandoned including this part of the composition by the time he was creating the marks for transferring the image to canvas.\n\nThe tool likely used to make these marks was a pair of straight-leg calipers or another measuring device with pointed ends (fig. 1.27). It was used to create measurement points in order to transfer the architectural elements, perspective, horizon, and vanishing points onto the canvas. The ratio of the sketch to the painting is approximately 1:7. When the distances between toolmarks on the drawing were measured and multiplied by seven, they corresponded closely to the equivalent measurements for the edges of the buildings, the architectural perspective, the horizon line, the cropping lines, and the vanishing points in the painting. In the drawing, the left point of the umbrella is touching a vertical graphite tick mark, and one of the tiny indentation marks is also found in this spot. The tick mark and toolmark are not for the umbrella but rather to emphasize the placement of the tallest zigzag figure just below the marks. In the painting, this figure becomes the man just to the left of the lamppost. In the annotated image shown here (fig. 1.28), the toolmark is seen above this figure and bears little relation to the architecture, horizon line, or vanishing points. The discovery of these measurement points on the drawing as a means of transferring the image to canvas provides new insights into Caillebotte\u2019s working method and links the drawing and canvas in a new and important way (see fig. 1.29).\n\nBetween 1995 and 2006, the drawing was treated to flatten the crimped upper left margin and the bent lower left corner.\n\nThe drawing is in fair to good condition. There is a small hole in the right margin, 22 mm from the right edge of the paper. Two smaller losses in the paper are located to the left of the lamppost, 53 mm from the top edge, and to the right of the lamppost, 115 mm from the top edge. There is significant smudging of the soft graphite over the surface. Several small drops of oil paint are noted on the surface of the drawing; these are not part of the image but probably accidental studio drips.\n\nA Leica M125 stereomicroscope 8\u2013100\u00d7 was used to identify the structure of the paper support. Transmitted-light examination was used to document the structure of the laid and chain lines of the paper support. Infrared reflectography (Fujifilm S5 Pro with X-Nite 1000B/2 mm filter [1.0\u20131.1 \u00b5m]) was used to enhance graphite and charcoal drawing.  \nAntoinette Owen\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">By descent from the artist (died 1894) to his family.\n\nGiven by the family of the artist to Kirk Varnedoe (1946\u20132003), New York, 1976.\n\nBy descent from Kirk Varnedoe (died 2003) to his wife, Elyn Zimmerman, New York.\n\nSold by Elyn Zimmerman, through James Goodman Gallery, New York, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2011.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Gustave Caillebotte: A Retrospective Exhibition, 1976\u20131977, Oct. 22, 1976\u2013Jan. 2, 1977, cat.

It depicts the spot where the rue de Madrid becomes the rue de Lisbonne and is intersected by the boulevard Malesherbes (now the rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Foy), a place only two hundred meters from Caillebotte\u2019s family home at the time. See Malcolm Park, \u201cThree Street Drawings by Gustave Caillebotte,\u201d Burlington Magazine 152, 1289 (Aug. 2010), pp. 537\u201338. See also Anne Distel, Douglas W. Druick, Gloria Groom, and Rodolphe Rapetti, with Julia Sagraves and an essay by Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte: Urban Impressionist (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), in which it is reproduced as fig. 18e and cat. 56.\n\nIn many ways, these drawings mirror one another in the foreground arrangement and placement of these set pieces (the nearest building and sidewalk). Both also present a slightly off-center main vanishing point that places the viewer on the sidewalk. It is also worth noting that View from rue de Madrid, like Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day,\u201d demonstrates Caillebotte\u2019s accurate portrayal of a complicated perspective that includes both parallel and perpendicular upward slopes. Although difficult to see in reproduction, the work appears to display differences in line hardness and thickness that suggest that it, like Study of \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day,\u201d combines an initial on-site sketch, possibly realized with an optical device, with a regularizing step partially aided by a straight edge.\n\nThe composition of View from rue de Madrid also suggests that Caillebotte was interested in leaving the left foreground empty. That intersection, with its wide expanse of open space at the right, readily accommodated this preference. According to Martin Jay, Baron Georges-Eug\u00e8ne Haussmann\u2019s project of beautifying Paris was aimed at increasing transparency. These new forms affected artists and students of Cartesian, or linear, perspective. In effect, \u201cthe Cartesian perspectivalist scopic regime seemed to find its perfect urban form\u2014a judgment symbolically supported by the fact that only in 1853 was Paris as a whole surveyed and definitively mapped for the first time.\u201d See Martin Jay, Downcast Eyes: The Denigration of Vision in Twentieth-Century French Thought (University of California Press, 1993), pp. 117\u201318. For the effect of this on Caillebotte, see Michael Marrinan, \u201cRue de Turin,\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte: A Painter in Paris, 1872\u20131887 (Getty Research Institute, forthcoming).\n\nIn creating the final painting, Caillebotte does appear to have referred to another study of this first site, a sketch of cobblestones; for an image of this sheet, Paving Stones in rue de Madrid, with a View towards rue de Lisbonne (c. 1875; private collection), see Malcolm Park, \u201cThree Street Drawings by Gustave Caillebotte,\u201d Burlington Magazine 152, 1289 (Aug. 2010), p. 537, fig. 33.\n\nThese stones are perhaps the pictorial expression of Caillebotte\u2019s understanding of Paris as a material space that, according to Michael Marrinan, \u201cconsists first and foremost of stone and glass, wood and metal, assembled into discrete physical units.\u201d Michael Marrinan, \u201cCaillebotte as Professional Painter,\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte and the Fashioning of Identity in Impressionist Paris, ed. Norma Broude (Rutgers University Press, 2002), p. 55.\n\nThis feature later appears as an amorphous dark-blue shape in the related painted study at the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Paris (1877 [Berhaut 1978, no. 51; Berhaut 1994, no. 56]; see cat. 2, fig. 2.24) and was transformed into a horseless carriage in the final painting.\n\nPeter Galassi asserts that the umbrella was placed here as its left edge aligns with \u201cthe golden section division of the width of the drawing.\u201d See Peter Galassi, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Method,\u201d in Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 37.\n\nAt this stage, Caillebotte was likely still exploring various possibilities for these umbrella-carrying characters, which may have included a man, who is represented alone and with a woman walking behind him, in addition to the forward-facing couple that appears in the Marmottan sketch (1877 [Berhaut 1978, no. 51; Berhaut 1994, no. 56]) and the finished painting. These sketches may represent a kind of progression in which Caillebotte began with the lone male figure, added a female figure, and finally arrived at a forward-facing couple. The gentleman appears alone in Study of a Man under an Umbrella Seen from the Front (1877; private collection) and Study of a Man under an Umbrella Seen from the Front, with Studies of Hands (1877; private collection); the pair appears in Study of a Man under an Umbrella Seen from the Front, with the Silhouette of a Woman under an Umbrella in the Right Background (1877; private collection) and Study of a Man under an Umbrella Seen from the Front, with the Silhouette of a Woman under an Umbrella in the Right Background (1877; private collection). See Anne Distel, Douglas W. Druick, Gloria Groom, and Rodolphe Rapetti, with Julia Sagraves and an essay by Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte: Urban Impressionist (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), cats. 51\u201354.\n\nPeter Galassi called this second step an \u201cordered vision\u201d based on the site rather than a direct representation of it. See Peter Galassi, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Method,\u201d in Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte (Yale University Press, 1987), pp. 27, 34.\n\nIn contrast, Pont de l\u2019Europe (1876 [Berhaut 1978, no. 44; Berhaut 1994, no. 49]) combines information from three different vantage points in a single painting and therefore required separate on-site and perspectival sketches. Peter Galassi, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Method,\u201d in Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte (Yale University Press, 1987), p. 29. For a full discussion of the multiple vantages, see Claude P. J. Ghez and Pietro Galifi della Bagliva, \u201cDeconstructing Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s Le Pont de l\u2019Europe (1876),\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte: Impressionist in Modern Paris, ed. Shimbata Yasuhide, exh. cat. (Bridgestone Museum of Art/Ishibashi Foundation, 2013), pp. 230\u201341.\n\nLines from the normalization step were digitally minimized after discussions with Antoinette Owen, Senior Conservator of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago, and Pablo Garcia, Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices, School of the Art Institute of Chicago. For a technical discussion of the drawing, see Compositional Development in the technical report.\n\nThere, however, they are combined with the splaying of the foreground that resulted from Caillebotte\u2019s extension of the setting depicted in the drawing to accommodate his figures.\n\nThe artist also appears to have established the compositional borders at this stage: a small, scratched X at the base of the lamp suggests that he probably used a compass to make the side borders equidistant, ensuring that the lamppost was exactly in the center of the drawing (see fig. 1.23 in the technical report).\n\nThis artificial raising of the vantage and adjustment of the horizon led to the exaggerated height of the foreground couple, who are estimated to be over six feet tall\u2014more precisely, 1.9 and 1.85 meters, respectively\u2014based on the scale of the architecture around them. See Claude P. J. Ghez and Orselie Bernier, \u201cGustave Caillebotte\u2019s \u2018Jour de Paris, temps de pluie\u2019: From Cityscape to Stage Set\u201d (unpublished manuscript, 2014).\n\nIt is not entirely clear how Caillebotte determined the specific location of this last vanishing point. The various orthogonals of the cobblestones are not always straight and do not, in their initial execution, meet at a distinct vanishing point. Garcia observed a small notation in the lower left corner of the ruled border that could be read as ~ 1.62, referring to the golden section; when a golden rectangle is extended from this corner to the lower of the two initial horizon lines, the rectangle meets the horizon directly below this vanishing point.\n\nAs the visible cobblestones, the sidewalk, and the far right building are all on the branch of the rue de Turin closest to the viewer, they should share a common vanishing point. The far left building, however, is on the rue de Saint-P\u00e9tersbourg and should have its own vanishing point (this adjustment is repeated in the final painting). Because they are lower in space, the orthogonals of the foreground\u2014the cobblestones, sidewalk, and caf\u00e9\u2014should have a vanishing point that is above the horizon line rather than on it. A discussion of this flattening of the foreground slope is presented in Claude P. J. Ghez and Orselie Bernier, \u201cGustave Caillebotte\u2019s \u2018Jour de Paris, temps de pluie\u2019: From Cityscape to Stage Set\u201d (unpublished manuscript, 2014). For a discussion of Caillebotte\u2019s previous experience with upward slopes, see Claude P. J. Ghez and Pietro Galifi della Bagliva, \u201cDeconstructing Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s Le Pont de l\u2019Europe (1876),\u201d in Gustave Caillebotte: Impressionist in Modern Paris, ed. Shimbata Yasuhide, exh. cat. (Bridgestone Museum of Art/Ishabashi Foundation, 2013), pp. 230\u201341.\n\nBefore the late eighteenth century, Western papermaking molds consisted of a wire screen that was stretched over a rigid wooden support. The chain wires were sewn to the wooden ribs of the support, causing a greater amount of pulp to form along the chain lines. In transmitted light, these appear as shadows. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, these shadows were eliminated by raising the screen away from the ribs with a second set of wires, hence a double-faced mold.\n\nAccording to Pablo Garcia, Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices, School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the maximum paper dimensions best utilized with the camera lucida approximate the dimensions of this sheet. Pablo Garcia to Caillebotte team, verbal communication, early 2015, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPeter Galassi, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Method,\u201d in Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte (Yale University Press, 1987), pp. 27\u201340. Galassi discusses what he calls Paris Street; Rainy Day\u2019s \u201cinterlocking proportional system of halves and golden sections.\u201d The golden section has a numerical value of 1.62.\n\nGraphite pencils, encased in wood, were available in varying degrees of hardness or softness. An 1886 Winsor and Newton catalog advertised, for example, \u201cNonpareil Drawing Pencils manufactured in twelve degrees\u201d from 6H (hardest) through 4B (softest), with HB in the middle. Soft pencils require very little pressure to lay down significant amounts of graphite on the surface, creating broad and dark lines, while hard pencils leave a different mark, depositing less graphite on the surface and creating fine, silvery lines.\n\nSee, respectively, Peter Galassi, \u201cCaillebotte\u2019s Method,\u201d in Kirk Varnedoe, Gustave Caillebotte (Yale University Press, 1987), pp. 27\u201340; and Claude P.

Ghez and Bernier suggest that Caillebotte transferred the lines in this sketch to the canvas of a painted study for Paris Street; Rainy Day (1877; Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, Paris [Berhaut 1978, no. 51; Berhaut 1994, no. 56]) with a pantograph and that the hole in the right margin is consistent with its having been made by a screw used to attach a pantograph to the work surface. It should be pointed out, however, that the Marmottan painted sketch is not a direct (or accurate) enlargement of the drawn sketch.\n\nFrank Zuccari, Grainger Executive Director of Conservation, Art Institute of Chicago, proposed this approximate formulation.
