    "description": "<p>Having been employed as a department-store janitor during his freshman year of college, Charles Ray understands the unease a mannequin can inspire\u2014an inanimate object that one might readily mistake for a live body. His work is also charged with the purely sculptural tensions that exist between surface and interior, armature and appendage, and or size and scale. With <em>Boy</em>, Ray created a particularly disquieting figure. The sculpture stands just shy of six feet tall, the artist\u2019s exact height, yet maintains the softness of youth in its rounded cheeks and limbs. The boy is clad in outdated garments, hovering \u201cbetween baby and Hitler<br>youth,\u201d in the words of one critic. Additionally, the boy\u2019s pose and gesture suggest a confrontational manner at odds with his neutral face.</p>\n",
