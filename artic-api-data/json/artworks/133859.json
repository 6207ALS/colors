    "description": "<p>This painting depicts a young woman lost in reverie after reading the letters of the ill-fated medieval lovers Heloise and Abelard. The objects on the table beside her\u2014a letter, a sheet of music, and a book of erotic poetry\u2014hint at a life of leisure and a susceptibility to love. In this early picture, Auguste Bernard drew upon history paintings by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36487/peter-paul-rubens\">Peter Paul Rubens</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35425/charles-le-brun\">Charles Le Brun</a>, as well as Parisian traditions of genre painting and portraiture pioneered by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34738/jean-baptiste-greuze\">Jean-Baptiste Greuze</a>. Bernard worked in Paris in the early 1780s and studied in Italy for several years. Upon his return to Paris, he found his career frustrated by the French Revolution and the emergent fashion for the more austere Neoclassical style.</p>\n",
