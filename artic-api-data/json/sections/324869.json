Joseph Pennell tentatively identified the locale as a restaurant in the passage des Panoramas where Whistler frequently dined with Th\u00e9odore Duret and other friends. Whistler must have mailed the transfer drawing for this lithograph to his printers in London a few days before 11 August 1894, when T. R. Way wrote to say that a new transfer had arrived safely that morning and queried: \u201cWhat is the subject of the new drawing? it is very good\u201d (letter 102).\n\nThe Ways were hard pressed to keep pace with Whistler\u2019s lithographic activity during July and early August 1894. New transfer drawings arrived every few days, and Whistler was always anxious to see proofs from them immediately. The printers complained to him that they never had enough good paper with which to fill his orders (letter 102). Nevertheless, Whistler had already received the first proofs of Late Picquet by August 14, when he sent a letter to T. R. Way identifying the image as one of three recent lithographs (cat. 91, cat. 93, and cat. 94) that he particularly liked because they were \u201csimple and direct\u201d (letter 104). His satisfaction with his recent work in lithography is also evident in another letter, mailed the same day to Marcus Huish of the Fine Art Society in London, in which he informed the dealer that he had decided to raise the price of his lithographs from two guineas to three, four, and five guineas.\n\nWhistler\u2019s enthusiasm for Late Picquet notwithstanding, there is no record that he asked the Ways to print more than the initial twenty-five proofs from the stone that he ordered in 1894. When he died, eighteen impressions remained in his estate.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (328 \u00d7 229 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (320 \u00d7 203 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 204 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (315 \u00d7 203 mm).
