Can space expand?&nbsp;</p><p>For more than a decade, American designer Jonathan Muecke (born 1983) has tackled such deceptively straightforward yet puzzling questions about the relationship between form, material, and perception through a range of creative experiments. <em>Objects in Sculpture</em>, the designer\u2019s first solo exhibition in a major museum, presents a selection of key works that have the capacity to generate new relationships between objects, bodies, and space.</p>",
