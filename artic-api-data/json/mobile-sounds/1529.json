    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Marsden Hartley was one of the most inventive American artists in the early 20th century. He moved through a number of avant-garde styles, but by the late 1930s he was creatively and emotionally exhausted. He retreated to his native Maine. There he turned to new subjects, like this portrait of a boxer, a man of Acadian or French Canadian descent, from the town of Madawaska, Maine. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: These nude figurative paintings of Hartley's later career have a strong masculine overtone, and this is a result of the country going to war. Masculine imagery, the image of the soldier, a superman. And these paintings, rather than identified for their homoerotic subject matter, became identified with the strong, virile American male.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: You can see traces of cubism in the masklike face, and the geometric forms of the body. The strong contrasts of color and light recall the influence of expressionism.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: This painting was offered to the museum in the 1960s, but the homoerotic overtones were considered too controversial by the museum board and the board of trustees, and it was rejected. The curator of 20th century painting, James Speyer, purchased it for himself and upon his death gave it as a gift to the museum.</p>\n",
