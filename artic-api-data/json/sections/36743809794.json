The painting brings to a close Renoir\u2019s work at the Restaurant Fournaise painting views of leisure boating along the Seine, a period that began in 1875, the year he painted Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise (The Rower\u2019s Lunch) (cat. 2). Why the artist abandoned the popular establishment and its convivial owners remains a mystery, as Renoir loved it there and recommended it to others. Writing in the late summer of 1880 to the collector Georges de Bellio, Renoir explained that he was too busy with Luncheon of the Boating Party (fig. 11.1 [Daulte 379; Dauberville 224]) to come to Paris, but he urged de Bellio to visit him at Chatou: \u201cYou would do well to choose a day and come to lunch. You will not be sorry you made the trip; this is the most attractive spot in the countryside around Paris.\u201d Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is the Primavera (Allegory of Spring) to Luncheon of the Boating Party\u2019s summer bacchanal. The leaves are still unfurling on the trees, and bright spring blossoms abound. In a letter to Th\u00e9odore Duret from Chatou on Easter Monday, April 18, 1881, Renoir again expressed reluctance to leave for a planned trip to England with the art critic because of his work on Two Sisters (On the Terrace): \u201cI am struggling with trees in bloom, with women and children, and wish to see nothing beyond that. . . . The weather is fine and I have my models; that\u2019s my only excuse.\u201d\n\nSoon after the painting was finished, the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel purchased it from Renoir as Femme sur une terrasse au bord de la Seine for 1,500 francs, the sum Renoir reportedly had received three years earlier for the substantially larger portrait Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children (1878; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]). Given the difficulties Renoir expressed in executing the painting and the high price he received, one could speculate that the work was commissioned by the dealer. The role of Two Sisters (On the Terrace) as a promotional vehicle for Impressionism began almost immediately, when a rare color reproduction was published in late 1881 in L\u2019art de la mode. In March 1882 the painting was included in the seventh Impressionist exhibition with the new title Les deux soeurs (see fig. 11.2). Durand-Ruel contributed twenty-five Renoir works from his stock after the artist refused to participate because he perceived Paul Gauguin and Camille Pissarro to be overly political. The following year the painting reappeared under a third title\u2014Femme sur une terrasse (Chatou)\u2014in Renoir\u2019s retrospective exhibition organized by Durand-Ruel and held on the boulevard de la Madeleine. Although Two Sisters (On the Terrace) was an eminently salable work, Durand-Ruel did not part with it for nearly four and a half decades. The painting was reproduced as an etching in a full-page illustration in Georges Lecomte\u2019s 1892 account of Durand-Ruel\u2019s private collection, one of a select number of Impressionist paintings the dealer kept for himself (see fig. 11.3). Not surprisingly, Lecomte presented Durand-Ruel as a visionary who at an early date recognized the innovative accomplishment of the Impressionists even while the French State remained undecided. For Lecomte the works in Durand-Ruel\u2019s private collection offered a complete history of Impressionism and represented the best of each artist\u2019s talent. In his discussion of Two Sisters (On the Terrace), Lecomte praised the color in the landscape elements and, in describing the figure of the young woman, commented on Renoir\u2019s evocation of the Old Masters: \u201cThe insinuating and crafty grace of her sly face is accentuated by the malicious obliquity and alarming smile in her eyes. She has the look of a modern Mona Lisa who knows all about love and seduction and is shamelessly flirting with you.\u201d While the Durand-Ruel family owned the painting, it appeared before the public in at least seventeen exhibitions or gallery displays and was continually reproduced (see Exhibition History and Selected References). It was only after Paul Durand-Ruel\u2019s death in June 1922 that the painting was sold to Mrs. Lewis Larned Coburn of Chicago (see Provenance).\n\nDespite the title Les deux soeurs, assigned to the painting by Durand-Ruel for the 1882 Impressionist exhibition, the little girl was not the sister of the seated figure, who was eighteen-year-old Eug\u00e9nie Marie Darlaud, known as Jeanne Darlaud, an aspiring actress (see fig. 11.4). For his painting Luncheon of the Boating Party, Renoir depicted known habitu\u00e9s of the Restaurant Fournaise as well as an elite group of cultural aficionados, including the actress Jeanne Samary, who had recently been appointed soci\u00e9taire of the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise. In Two Sisters (On the Terrace) he again drew from the Parisian theater world. Here Darlaud played the role of a canoti\u00e8re (rower), a free spirit who divided her time between Parisian dance halls and a life of leisure along the Seine. Such a character was later immortalized in Guy de Maupassant\u2019s novel Yvette (1884), but even in 1881 the canoti\u00e8re had been inspiring writers and poets for some time.\n\nPaul Durand-Ruel first made the association between this painting and the Darlaud family in 1923, when he mistakenly recalled that the young woman pictured was Jeanne Darlaud\u2019s younger sister Anne (known by her stage name, Jane Demarsy), who also modeled for Renoir. Durand-Ruel\u2019s confusion may have arisen because Anne posed for Renoir in an unknown setting wearing the same boating costume: a blue dress with a cape or hood attached, and a hat of the same design with beige finish around the brim, but blue rather than red (fig. 11.5 [Daulte 424; Dauberville 1060]). It was the art historian Fran\u00e7ois Daulte who eventually identified the model as Jeanne. The collector and art dealer Ren\u00e9 Gimpel described the Darlaud sisters as girls of humble origins who worked for Renoir as a necessary source of income. As Colin Bailey discovered, they were the daughters of a bookbinder and a brocade weaver, and their grandfather was a cabinetmaker from Limoges who probably knew Renoir\u2019s father, L\u00e9onard, a tailor from that city. Jeanne Darlaud entered the Conservatoire in August 1882 and soon afterward began a busy career on the French stage, from which she retired in 1899. After her death in 1914, her cash assets totaled more than 574,000 francs, the result of gifts from a wealthy and generous seigneur, apparently the chocolate manufacturer Gaston Menier, who was listed as the trustee of her h\u00f4tel particulier on the avenue de Friedland.\n\nThe little girl in the painting has never been identified, and the artist left no clues to the relationship she might share with the young woman, leaving viewers to draw their own conclusions. Difference in age is not enough to explain the lack of engagement, the look of boredom that Lecomte took for crafty grace or the apparent absence of emotion in the child\u2019s expression. Certainly in Madame George Charpentier and Her Children (fig. 11.6), Renoir proved himself capable of conveying warmth and love between family members. That he seems to have made no attempt to do so in Two Sisters (On the Terrace) may have to do with the fact that it is a genre painting, while the other is a portrait commissioned by an important patron. In its treatment of the subject of an adult and a child, Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is conspicuously different from a painting of the same year by Berthe Morisot, Eug\u00e8ne Manet and His Daughter at Bougival (fig. 11.7), which also appeared in the seventh Impressionist exhibition.\n\nIf Two Sisters (On the Terrace) presents an idyllic scene, timeless in its serenity, its composition is quite sophisticated, with surprising contrasts in the figure-ground relationship. For the landscape setting Renoir used loose, expressive brushwork, whereas he rendered the figures with a more controlled brush and precise modeling of solid colors. He painted directly on the canvas, using red lake to outline at least some of the forms, as can be seen around the seated figure\u2019s right eye (fig. 11.8). There are no known preparatory sketches, though the artist had dealt with the theme of a single female figure on a terrace at least twice in the previous two years, in Alphonsine Fournaise in 1879 (fig. 11.9 [Daulte 301; Dauberville 321]) and Young Girl Seated in about 1880 (fig. 11.10 [Daulte 356; Dauberville 323]). In the latter painting, the young woman sits in a chair with a fabric back and arms, of comparable design to that in Two Sisters (On the Terrace). Changes to the background to the right of Jeanne Darlaud\u2019s head and above the planter indicate that Renoir wished to subdue objects in the background landscape to give it a more nascent, diaphanous look in keeping with the season. For example, the shoreline path may originally have included two figures above the railing to the left of Jeanne\u2019s head, visible in the infrared image (fig. 11.11). Renoir painted over these in favor of a single rowing figure in a skiff that blends into the line of the river.\n\nIn the background, thin layers of pink and blue tones were laid in first for the water, followed by short strokes of denser blues and whites to convey a rich and varied river surface with light playing over the ripples and waves. The foliage and tree branches were painted with the lightest of touches in greens, pale grays, and mauves. So transparent are the paint layers that they seem like a veil through which can be glimpsed skiffs, moored sailboats, and the opposite bank. There is plenty of white or light-colored paint in the background that increases the impression of sparsity in the vegetation, especially along the left side of the canvas. Infrared imaging reveals that Renoir originally painted a second set of curving decorations between the rails of the balcony and halfway down their length. Traces of this decoration are still visible beneath the upper paint layers to the left of the seated figure\u2019s elbow (see fig. 11.12). Their removal allowed the blossoming trees behind to have a fuller and wilder presence.\n\nCompared to the gossamer landscape, the two female figures are finely modeled with generous amounts of paint. This distinctly different treatment of background and figure was a change from Renoir\u2019s work of the 1870s, where he made use of a \u201cpantheistic\u201d brushstroke that did not differentiate between the viewing planes. Alfred Sisley (1876; cat. 4), exhibited at the third Impressionist exhibition of April 1877, is a good example of the stippled brushwork of these 1870s portraits. In contrast, the flesh tones in Two Sisters (On the Terrace) were painted with barely visible strokes that carefully integrated the red and white tones. The deep blue of the young woman\u2019s boating costume appears sculptural against the willowy trees and spring blooms that surround her. The blending of red lake over the blue creates darker shadows in the dress at the elbow, while the highlights of reflected sunlight on her chest result from thin films of yellow. Despite the firmer appearance of the figures, they are no less luminous. There is plenty of lead white in the little girl\u2019s dress, and the flesh tones have a porcelain-like clarity, touched with red to give color to the cheeks. In depicting the young woman wearing a bright red hat with her dark blue dress, Renoir achieved a striking juxtaposition of primary colors. An audacious rendering, but one that may have been inspired by the bold fashions of boaters on the Seine. In his novel Yvette, Guy de Maupassant related that the canoti\u00e8res at this time wore \u201ca dress of blue flannel or red flannel, a parasol, also red or blue, open over their head, brilliant under the hot sun. . . .\u201d\n\nThe basket of wool appears to have been included in order to give the foreground more substance and color. Such an accessory was unlikely to have been found on the premises of the Maison Fournaise, which rented boats and ran a restaurant, unless it was brought by one of the boarding guests. The wool seems of little interest to either of the figures, who interact with it no more than they interact with each other. Colin Bailey has pointed out that criticism of Renoir frequently incorporated references to wool; he surmises that \u201cRenoir incorporates this critical trope in order to deflate it.\u201d\n\nTwo Sisters (On the Terrace) is a genre painting that portrays what Renoir valued most about everyday life along the Seine: the opportunity for enjoyment of nature and good company away from the urban distractions of Paris.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">The work was executed on a standard-size, commercially prepared canvas with a manufacturer\u2019s stamp on the verso, now only visible in transmitted light due to a subsequent lining (see Conservation History). The canvas is of a fine weave and has a smooth, white ground that moderately fills the weave. While there is no apparent underdrawing, examination in transmitted light indicates that Renoir may have outlined some of the major forms at some point early in the painting process. The nature and sequence of these lines is ambiguous, as some appear to have been worked into the upper paint layers while still wet. Transmitted-light and X-ray images also illustrate that changes were made to the figures. The woman\u2019s head and hat were altered and her right arm brought closer to her body. The artist heavily painted out his original placement of the woman\u2019s facial features before settling on the final arrangement, but the faint outline of an eye is visible above and to the right of her left eye, indicating more substantial changes. These images also show something of Renoir\u2019s working method, especially with regard to the child. Here he wiped away flesh-colored paint from the child\u2019s forehead and cheeks and altered the color and texture in these areas with subsequent, much thinner paint layers. The artist used scraping to remove previous compositional choices along the right side of the woman\u2019s collar and in large areas of the background. This reworking is apperent only in the x-ray; there is a no textural evidence of it on the surface. He reworked much of the background, exchanging fuller, more substantial foliage for the finer, more ephemeral leaves and vines now visible.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 11.13).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. 81. (lower right, in blue paint) (fig. 11.14, fig. 11.15).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were approximately 100 \u00d7 81 cm, according to 1972 pretreatment measurements. This is consistent with measurements from the apparent original foldover and corresponds to a no. 40 portrait (figure) standard-size (100 \u00d7 81 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 30.9V (0.8) \u00d7 25.9H (1.1) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThere is mild cusping corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. The thread density along the warp (vertical) threads increases toward the right side of the canvas (fig. 11.16). The warp threads near the right edge of the canvas have primary cusping, which indicates that this canvas was near the edge of the preprimed roll during commercial preparation (fig. 11.17). Any evidence of an unprimed edge or selvedge was removed from this side before or just after stretching.\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was relined and restretched in 1972, the original dimensions were increased slightly on all sides (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on secondary cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 5\u20138 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-member ICA spring stretcher with a metal horizontal crossbar. Depth: 2.8 cm.\n\nPrevious stretcher: Because the painting was already lined when the 1972 treatment was undertaken, it is unclear whether the stretcher that was removed at that time was original to the painting; however, that stretcher was a six-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher with vertical and horizontal crossbars. Depth: approximately 1.6 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: verso of original canvas (covered by lining)  \nMethod: ovular stamp  \nContent: [COULEURS FINES &amp; TOILES \u00c0 TABLEAUX] / P: APRIN / PARIS / [48 RUE DE DOUAI 48] (fig. 11.18, fig. 11.19)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe painting features a two-layer commercial ground that extends to the edges of the tacking margins. The layer lower is approximately 3\u201345 \u00b5m thick, while the upper layer is approximately 15\u201375 \u00b5m thick. Overall the preparation is smooth and moderately fills the weave. The ground is left visible in some areas of the painting, especially on the upper left.\n\nThe upper layer of the ground appears white, with no colored particles visible under stereomicroscopic or cross-sectional examination (fig. 11.20). The lower, chalk-based layer appears creamy white in cross sections.\n\nThe commercial preparation is a two-layer priming beginning with a calcium-carbonate (chalk) layer (fig. 11.21); this layer also contains traces of complex silicates (clays). The upper layer is predominantly lead white with a small amount of calcium-based white and traces of barium sulfate, silica, alumina, and complex iron-containing silicates (fig. 11.22). The binder of the upper layer is estimated to be oil.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography or under microscopic examination. In transmitted light and transmitted infrared, outlines can be seen around the major forms, but it is unclear at which stage in the painting process these lines were made (fig. 11.18). Close examination of the eyes under the microscope indicates that Renoir may also have used red lake to mark forms in the early painting stages (fig. 11.23).\n\nThe X-ray, infrared, and transmitted-light images indicate that Renoir made a number of changes to the composition. They also reveal something of his technique and application of paint. In some areas, evidence of scraping back and painting out earlier forms hints at compositional changes; however, the exact nature of these changes remains hidden. In certain places, the artist seems to have wiped or scraped paint away, then further painted out evidence of earlier choices to give himself a cleaner slate, as in the background to the right of the woman\u2019s head. In many areas of the background, especially immediately around the woman\u2019s head, large strokes resembling heavy tree branches or shrubs, and an unidentified round form on the right, appear to have been painted out in favor of finer, more atmospheric foliage. Immediately behind the figures, heavier greenery, like that still visible on the left above the basket, is still faintly discernible behind the vines and finer strokes of vegetation. On the left, above the railing, Renoir seems to have initially articulated a shoreline path with two walking figures, seen in infrared examination (fig. 11.24), which were subsequently painted out and replaced with a skiff and rower (fig. 11.25). Most of the background itself appears to be underpainted in modulated blues and pinks, perhaps related to the depiction of the water, while the upper layers\u2014including the finer branches, leaves, and vines\u2014were brought in around the figures. For the most part, the upper two thirds of the background were executed with thinned paint and a dry brush, creating an almost feathered effect. The artist also made small changes to compositional elements immediately surrounding the figures. The planter on the right initially had three dark bands across it, resembling a wine cask, and the angle of the chair back immediately to the right of the woman\u2019s shoulder was subtly changed. In the lower left corner, the X-ray shows heavy diagonal strokes where Renoir painted out his initial choice before executing the last skeins of yarn wet-in-wet.\n\nThe artist made changes to the woman\u2019s face and hat; however, the nature of these changes is not entirely clear. It appears that the profile of the hat was softened and rounded in the later painting stages. The flower embellishments were established early and later partially obscured by the addition of the golden-colored brim (fig. 11.26). The woman\u2019s posture appears slightly altered at the shoulders, her right arm is closer to her body, and her waist is slimmer (fig. 11.27). Heavy diagonal strokes across and around the woman\u2019s head probably indicate previous choices painted out by Renoir (fig. 11.28). Amid these strokes, above and slightly to the right of the eyes, the outline of an earlier left eye is faintly visible, indicating perhaps more radical changes to this figure\u2019s face. The visible composition and the thickness of these diagonal strokes camouflage the nature of these changes. Elsewhere the artist appears to have scraped away paint to change the composition, as seen in the woman\u2019s collar on the right.\n\nRenoir also made changes to the child, slightly altering the silhouette of her hat, moving her hands and possibly her arms, and perhaps thinning her face. The X-ray indicates that the child\u2019s hands may have been slightly closer to the woman, or farther from the viewer in space, while the infrared image suggests that the fingers were initially longer and more relaxed. The X-ray and transmitted-light images also reveal that the artist used wiping to clear away some of the paint on the child\u2019s face, namely on her cheek and parts of her hair (fig. 11.29). The flesh tones appear to have been thinly painted before the heavier tones were applied, and wiping removed the heavy, opaque flesh tones in favor of a more translucent layer that takes advantage of the reflective qualities of the ground. After wiping the cheeks to reveal the thin underpaint, Renoir applied a thin, translucent pink tone over the area to balance the transition (fig. 11.30). There is a notable difference in effect between the child\u2019s cheeks and the woman\u2019s face. The child\u2019s hat was altered in color, decoration, and shape. The artist appears to have begun painting the hat with a paler wet-in-wet mixture of blue and white still visible on either side of the floral decoration. One flower on the left and perhaps two or three on the right appear in the X-ray, while the rest were added later. The crown of the hat was also shortened and is now almost entirely hidden by flowers. The dark-blue, green, and red lake shadows around the underside of the hat were also added in a later painting stage.\n\nRound and flat brushes, mostly fine, with some strokes up to 1 cm wide; cloth for wiping; palette knife for scraping.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, emerald green, viridian, vermilion, red lake, iron oxide yellow and brown, chrome yellow, and zinc yellow.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic orange fluorescence under UV light indicates that Renoir used large amounts of red lake in the figures\u2019 flesh tones, the woman\u2019s hat, various flowers, the yarn on the lower left, and select portions of the background (fig. 11.31).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish dates from the 1972 treatment, which removed a previous natural-resin varnish. It is unclear whether this natural-resin varnish was original to the painting or applied during a previous treatment.\n\nThe painting was first examined in 1956 and found to have flaking and cleavage along the woman\u2019s collar. A loan exam from the following year lists the painting as aqueously lined and sagging, with buckling of the canvas and small losses throughout. At this time the painting was also noted as being varnished, having a substantial layer of grime, and being loose within its frame. Preloan treatment was proposed and included relaxing the buckles with local application of wax, keying out the stretcher, and removing the grime layer. It is unclear whether this treatment was ever undertaken.\n\nThe painting was treated in 1972 in preparation for exhibition. Conditions noted at the time included a brittle lining, flattened impasto (presumably from the previous lining), and a discolored natural-resin varnish. During this treatment, grime, varnish, and the lining were removed, and the work was faced with mulberry-fiber paper and starch paste in preparation for lining. The old six-member stretcher was discarded, and the work was wax-resin lined and then tacked to a four-member ICA spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions (100 \u00d7 81 cm). The work was inpainted and given a synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, inpainting, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe work is in good condition, planar with a stable wax-resin lining and few losses. Curiously, during the 1972 treatment, a vertical strip of unidentified white material, containing large amounts of zinc, was applied either to the lining canvas or to the verso of the painting before the lining was applied (fig. 11.32). Either before or during the lining process, this material dried and cracked, and the original canvas settled into these cracks during the lining process so that deformations are visible on the surface in raking light (fig. 11.33). As a result of this lining, the original canvas is saturated with wax resin and very dark, and the ground layer also appears darker. Retouching during the 1972 treatment was mostly limited to abrasions on both figures\u2019 faces and on the extended perimeter. Along the bottom edge, the perimeter was extended so that some of the tack holes are now on the front, and previous tearing around these old tack holes was filled and retouched, as in the bottom left corner. There is fine cracking throughout both hats and the woman\u2019s blue dress. Zinc yellow found throughout has darkened slightly, giving it a more earthy hue (fig. 11.34). The work has a synthetic varnish that imparts an even gloss and saturation.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1997/98): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, mid-seventeenth-century, Louis XIII, carved gilt torus frame with laurel-and-berry garlands, flower centers, and corner acanthus leaves. The frame has water gilding over red-brown bole on gesso and retains its original gilding and aged glue sizing. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished, and the cove frieze and fillet are burnished. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled, dovetailed splines. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is cove; torus face with laurel-and-berry garlands, flower centers, corner acanthus leaves, and strapped corners; cove front frieze bordered with fillets; and ogee with leaf-tip sight molding (fig. 11.35).\n\nPrevious frame (installed mid 1960s, removed 1997/98): The painting was previously housed in an American (APF Master Frame Makers, New York), mid-twentieth-century, Louis XVI reproduction, architrave frame of basswood, mitered and nailed, with water gilding over red bole on sprayed gesso. The molding featured ribbon-and-stave ornament, a lozenge-and-bead sight molding, and an independent gilt liner (fig. 11.36).\n\nPrevious frame (installed prior to 1933, removed mid-1960s): The painting was previously housed in a French (Paris), late-nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate center and corner cartouches, and an independent liner. The frame had water and oil gilding over bole on cast plaster and gesso. Two different shades of gold were used: one alloy on the outer frame and another on the liner. The bole color was also varied: red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the cast foliate ornament on the ogee and sight moldings, the scotia sides, and the liner; and red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. The ornament and sight molding were selectively burnished, and the liner was burnished. The frame had an overall bronze tone, with casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes. The frame had a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face. The molding, from perimeter to interior, was fillet with cast, stylized, running, undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast crosshatched bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with a cove sight edge (fig. 11.37).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, July 7, 1881, for 1,500 francs.\n\nSent by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, 1922.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, Feb. 4, 1925, for $100,000.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932) to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, 251, rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, Salons du Panorama de Reischoffen, 7me exposition des artistes independants [seventh Impressionist exhibition], Mar. 1\u201331, 1882, cat. 138, as Les deux soeurs.\n\nParis, Durand-Ruel, Exposition des oeuvres de P.-A.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue. The presence of cobalt blue was confirmed with XRF. See Marc Vermeulen, \u201cRen\\_33\\_455\\_Two\\_sisters\\_XRF,\u201d Apr. 5, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_445\\_Renoir\\_analysis\\_report,\u201d Apr. 24, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and the standard size may be a result of this approximation, in addition to the restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out that the canvas has undergone over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Two Sisters (On the Terrace), Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1881 (D378/1933.455),\u201d Feb. 2012.\n\nStrong cusping along a single side of a canvas generally indicates that it came from the edge of a larger section of canvas (1\u20132 meters wide by 5\u201310 meters long) that was commercially prepared and later cut down to make smaller canvases. For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46; Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), p. 52. Thread-angle maps were produced with Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Two Sisters (On the Terrace), Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1881 (D378/1933.455),\u201d Feb. 2012.\n\nThis depth measurement is based on fold marks and tacking margins, which are somewhat damaged by age and previous treatment.\n\nThe canvas stamp is visible in transmitted light and transmitted infrared and is preserved as a tracing, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. The location of the color merchant\u2019s stamp, upside down and not centered, indicates that it may have been placed around horizontal and vertical crossbars. A stamp for P: Aprin also appears on Near the Lake (1879/80; cat. 10, see Manufacturer\u2019s/supplier\u2019s marks), which, interestingly, shares many similarities in the structure and composition of the ground layer.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_445\\_Renoir\\_analysis\\_report,\u201d Apr. 24, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSkeletal marine fossils, including coccoliths, are clearly visible in this layer, indicating a natural chalk. This layer also contains unusually large, iron-rich silicate particles. The binding medium of this layer was not analyzed and is not immediately apparent. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_445\\_Renoir\\_analysis\\_report,\u201d Apr. 24, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. The presence of lead, calcium, and barium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected silica, alumina, and complex iron-containing silicates. The presence of lead was also confirmed by PLM. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 8, 2013. For more detailed results and specific conditions used, see Marc Vermeulen, \u201cRen\\_33\\_455\\_Two\\_sisters\\_XRF,\u201d Apr. 5, 2012; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_445\\_Renoir\\_analysis\\_report,\u201d Apr. 24, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, emerald green (PLM, XRF, SEM/EDX); vermilion (PLM 1972, XRF); ultramarine blue (electron microprobe); red lake (aluminum substrate) (PLM, SEM/EDX); zinc yellow (XRF, PLM 2012, SEM/EDX); chrome yellow, iron oxide yellow and brown (XRF, PLM 2012); viridian (PLM 2012). PLM and electron microprobe results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211. PLM results were confirmed and amended by Inge Fiedler. See Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 8, 2013.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nInitially identified as Naples yellow in 1972, the pigment has been confirmed to be zinc yellow.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.

In the same letter, the Durand-Ruel Archives explain that the deposit number (no. 8124) is also recorded in the Durand-Ruel, Paris, deposit book for 1902\u201304. This corrects information previously published in Colin B. Bailey, with the assistance of John B. Collins, Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat.

Bailey identified this painting as possibly cat. 2 (Les deux soeurs, belonging to M. Ch.[arles] Ephrussi) in the Exposition des oeuvres de P.-A. Renoir, Apr. 1\u201325, 1883 (Durand-Ruel, Paris, Catalogue de l\u2019exposition des oeuvres de P.-A. Renoir, exh. cat. [Pillet &amp; Dumoulin, 1883], p. 9, cat. 2). After including the possible ownership of the painting by Charles Ephrussi in 1883, Bailey says the painting was back with the Durand-Ruel family by 1892 and that it was purchased from Joseph Durand-Ruel by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago. According to the Durand-Ruel Archives, the Art Institute painting was not cat. 2 in the 1883 exhibition but rather cat. 30 (Femme sur une terrasse (Chatou), no owner listed), so Ephrussi would not be in the ownership history of the painting.
