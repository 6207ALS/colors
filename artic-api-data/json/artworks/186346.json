He would later cite this year as the \u201cworst time of his life,\u201d as he was embroiled in a personal crisis: his mistress, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Walter, was pregnant, and his wife, Olga, was leaving him. The dark line work surrounding this bouquet might be reflective of the stress the artist was experiencing at the time.</p>\n",
