    "description": "<p>The Gradient Puzzle is a vibrant way to meditate on color. The act of putting it together is slow and deliberate, where the color of each piece is used to locate its proper position. Made of a thick stock and high quality art paper, so the puzzle can be assembled again and again without losing its edge.</p><p>Puzzle is 18x24 when assembled.</p>",
