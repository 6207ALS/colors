    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Dating from about 1740 this elaborate jug was made by Charles Frederick Kandler a German-born silversmith who lived and worked in London for most of his life. At this time, London\u2019s wealthy merchant class was expanding fast joining the aristocracy in providing a thriving market for luxury goods such as this piece. Kandler drew on classically mythology to create a design fitting to the jug\u2019s purpose. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: All of the decorative elements are expressive of the use of this ewer for wine. The finial is in the form of a seated Pan figure blowing his pipes. The spout is in the form of a leopard whose neck is encrusted with grapevines. And the handle is in the form of caryatid female figure who is holding a bunch of grapes above her head about to eat one of them.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: These elements subtlety flatter the wine jug\u2019s owner implying that he had been educated to understand classical references. The jug also features witty details to entertain a drinking party. It\u2019s lower part features putti or classical babies. The central pair tread grapes and raise toasts. Meanwhile, their overindulgent friend sleeps off the effects nearby.</p>\n",
