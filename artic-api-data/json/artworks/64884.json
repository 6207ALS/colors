    "description": "<p>Koloman Moser, a prominent Viennese designer, cofounded the Wiener Werkstatte (1903\u201332), a forward-looking Viennese design workshop. Prior to 1903 he was an influential member of the Moderne Movement in Vienna. Moser was also a founder of the Vienna Secession, the association of young artists who had broken away from the Wiener K\u00fcnstlerhaus, the accepted artistic forum of the time. <em>Poppyheads</em>, designed by Moser three years before the Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte was formed, foreshadowed the kind of elegant textile designs he would produce at the Werkst\u00e4tte. The attenuated lines coupled with the simplification and abstraction of organic forms demonstrate a new aesthetic vision of the time shared by artists and designers in Vienna and Glasgow. Moser\u2019s design was produced in various colors by the Viennese firm of Johann Backhausen und S\u00f6hne, which was closely linked to the Werkst\u00e4tte and is still in business today. The textile was intended for upholstery or curtain fabric, ideally for rooms whose design and furnishings would be produced as total environments by Werkst\u00e4tte artists.</p>\n",
