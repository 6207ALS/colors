    "description": "<p><em>The Birmingham News, 1963</em> refers to a seismic year in the civil rights movement. Countless instances of police brutality and arrests of black civil rights participants culminated in President John F. Kennedy\u2019s deployment of federal troops to Birmingham, Alabama. The tense standoff made daily headlines nationwide, but, as the selected covers from April 3 to May 13 testify, the <em>Birmingham News</em> purposefully downplayed the violence against African Americans. Critically interrogating the deep-rooted interrelations between race and language, Bethany Collins transforms these covers into a site of intervention that memorializes events ignored by the Birmingham press. Collins embossed, darkened, and distressed the front pages, reviving the very histories they ignored through this process of alteration and erasure. Emblematic of her conceptual and text-based practice, <em>The Birmingham News, 1963</em> demonstrates how authored and institutional texts are always politicized, even when they take on the guise of objective reporting.</p>\n",
