    "short_description": "<p>The Art Institute of Chicago has the unprecedented&nbsp;opportunity to present five works by the American painter Mark Rothko, including two loans and three works from the museum\u2019s collection. These extraordinary works show the artist at the height of his ability to create deeply experiential paintings that radiate light as if through an inner source. Rothko\u2019s five paintings join <em>\"Untitled\"</em> (1989) by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a key work by this pioneering conceptual artist in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.</p>",
