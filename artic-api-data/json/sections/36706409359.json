Harrison Collection, 1933.893\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Caricature of Henri Cassinelli (\u201cRufus Croutinelli\") was drawn in graphite on smooth tan card. Some dark graphite lines used to define the figure created a slight deformation in the paper and are highly reflective in specular illumination. Shading with the side of the graphite point creates modeling in the face (fig. 9.1). Highlights result from an absence of media, allowing the light tonality of the paper to show through. Broad passages of crosshatched or intersecting graphite lines suggest patterns in the clothing. There is minimal creation of atmosphere or space other than the suggestion of shadow cast below the figure.\n\nClaude Monet (recto, center top edge, in graphite).\n\nTan, thick, smooth wove paper.\n\nUniform, without visible inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven, machine made.\n\nAll edges appear to have been cut down and are slightly irregular. There are approximately six pinholes forming a circular arrangement at the center top.\n\n130 \u00d7 85 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. There is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence under UV illumination that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe work was drawn in graphite. The figure is defined with firm, dense lines that create slight deformation in the paper and reflect light in specular illumination. Some shading was created in the face with the side of the graphite point. Broad passages of pattern were created in the clothing with crosshatching or intersecting lines. There is only minimal creation of atmosphere or space other than the shadow below the figure. Faint, ruled graphite lines are visible along the upper right and bottom edges, 2\u20133 mm in from the edges.\n\nThere is no drawing on the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in stable condition. There is light surface soiling and slight transfer of graphite overall. Smudges and faint stains are visible in the upper right corner and at the bottom right edge. There are small spots of foreign material at the upper right corner and the lower right and lower left sides. Specular illumination reveals a short scratch at the lower center. The support has a slight concave curl overall.\n\nThe support is moderately discolored on the verso. There are numerous blue-wove and Japanese paper remnants around the perimeter on the verso from various hinging and mounting campaigns.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D495 (ill.); 144, cat. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the estate documents for Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
