Intaglio prints are measured to the platemark; lithographs and other planographic prints are measured to the furthest extent of the image; drawings are measured to the edges of the paper support, or sheet; and paintings are measured to the edges of the canvas stretcher bars or wood panel. In each case, height precedes width. The term \u201csight\u201d indicates the extent of the visible image for works measured within their frames.\n\nCatalogue raisonn\u00e9 information has been provided when available for prints discussed in the text.
