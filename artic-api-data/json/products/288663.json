    "description": "<p>Roman bangles were often adjustable, with overlapping ends that could be tightened or opened according to the wishes or needs of the wearer. This is one such example, with ends that may be closed or opened slightly, though the flat nature of the bracelet differentiates it from the other bracelets in the class that typically feature a rounded shape. <br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\"Aequitas\" means \"equity,\" \"fairness,\" and \"symmetry and evenness.\" The Roman Aequitas was the personification of equity and fairness, and was often depicted holding a pair of scales to represent equality and fair dealings. Representing true fairness, she was regarded as a goddess of honest merchants, presiding over fair dealings in contracts and negotiations.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Details:&nbsp;<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\u2022 Height: 7 mm (.25 in)<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\u2022 18K Gold Over Sterling Silver</p>",
