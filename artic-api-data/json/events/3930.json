His work, noted for its visual simplicity and sensitivity to its surroundings, is also characterized by an acute attention to materials: large expanses of unadorned concrete walls are combined with wooden or stone floors. In addition, his projects engage with natural elements, incorporating the sun, rain, and wind as distinctive features. Ando has designed many notable buildings, including Row House in Sumiyoshi, Osaka, 1976, which won the annual prize of the Architectural Institute of Japan in 1979; Church of the Light, Osaka, 1989; the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, St. Louis, 2001; Teatro Armani, Milan, 2001; Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, 2002; and 21_21 Design Sight in Tokyo, 2007. His many awards include the Gold Medal of Architecture, Academie d'Architecture (French Academy of Architecture) in 1989; the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1995; Gold Medal of the American Institute of Architects in 2002; and Gold Medal of Union Internationale des Architectes in 2005. Ando is an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects and the American Academy of Arts and Letters as well as the Royal Academy of Arts in London. He has taught widely, including at the universities of Yale, Columbia, Harvard, and Berkeley.</p><p>Presented with the Architecture &amp; Design Society and the Alphawood Foundation Chicago</p><p>Presented by the Butler-VanderLinden Lecture on Architecture and the Alphawood Foundation Chicago</p>",
