    "description": "<p>At the turn of the 19th century, the Tiffany showroom was at 333 Fourth Ave in New York City. Here Tiffany displayed a stained glass window of a storm-tossed sailboat at sea. In the sky is a threatening thunderstorm with flashes of light among the heavy gray clouds, and the sea is choppy, roiled by the gusty wind. These effects were made by layering sheets of different colored and patterned glass. It is a tour de force of artisanship, color, and form.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>1 x 3.50 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Solid brass, electro-plated with non-tarnishing silver finish, giclee print, packaged in an acetate sleeve with provenance card</li></ul>",
