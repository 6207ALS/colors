    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Print developed from Hans Hofmann\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Golden Wall,</em>&nbsp;1961, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Frustrated by the limits of linear perspective,&nbsp;Hans Hofmann introduced his \u201cpush-and-pull \u201d theory in order to create a more dynamic sense of space in his paintings, in which forms and colors appear to simultaneously advance and recede. In&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Golden Wall&nbsp;</em>(1961), rectangles of varying sizes and colors direct the gaze across the picture. Some forms appear to float above the expressive brushstrokes that punctuate the work, while others are embedded in the background, providing the canvas with a lively sense of movement and dimension.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image size:&nbsp;</strong>13 in. x 11 in.</li><li><strong>Full poster size:</strong> 12 in. x 16&nbsp;in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Premium Cardstock</li></ul>",
