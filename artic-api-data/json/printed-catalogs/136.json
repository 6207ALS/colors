    "copy": " This book appears in conjunction with an exhibition showcasing the unique collection of contemporary American realist drawings assembled over the last twenty-five years by Chicago collectors Jalane and Richard Davidson. The Davidsons began collecting in 1975 in response to what they perceived as a \u201cmovement\u201d among American artists to represent the physical world in a realist idiom and from a humanist standpoint. Spanning the period from 1960 to the present, the Davidson Collection features works by such artists as William Bailey, Janey Fish, Alex Katz, Alice Neel, and Philip Pearlstein. The publication offers fine, all-color reproductions of 125 of the drawings in the Davidson Collection at the Art Institute, and focuses on a trend in American contemporary art that is still largely ignored by critics. It also includes individual artists\u2019 biographies and a critical essay by noted author and curator Ruth Fine.   By Ruth Fine, Raymond Hernandez-Duran, and Mark Pascale   144 pages, 9 5/8 \u00d7 10 1/4 in. 126 color and 14 b/w ills. Out of print ISBN: 978-0-865-59180-6 (hardcover) ",
