    "description": "<p>Douglas Huebler used diverse systems of documentation to chronicle rule-based but unscripted events and encounters. <em>Variable Piece #70</em> stands as the most ambitious project of his career\u2014to make a photographic record of \u201ceveryone alive.\u201d The utter futility of the premise was liberating, and Huebler would set different terms of play for each foray. For <em>Variable Piece #70 (In Process): 166A</em>, he asked participants to describe themselves by selecting from a set of 80 placards imprinted with different personal characteristics. This work features all five people who posed with the sign reading \u201cOne person who may be culturally dislocated.\u201d Far from a fastidious archivist, Huebler pursued <em>Variable Piece #70</em> until his death, always undermining the project\u2019s potential rigor with allowances for subjectivity and humor.</p>\n",
