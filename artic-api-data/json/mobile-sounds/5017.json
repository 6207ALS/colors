    "transcript": "<p>Speaker 1:<br>Curator, Caitlin Haskell.<br>Caitlin Haskell:<br>You've got nude figures together with cloths, with drapery and there are some smaller subgroups within the figure setting, but together there's this mass of bodies. They're taken from life, but they're also taken from art and they're set within this landscape with some trees, functioning in ways that we've seen Ce\u0301zanne use trees as framing elements in the past. But it's also just a gorgeous abstraction and application of paint. In terms of an actual source, it's a blend. It's a blend of museum looking, making landscapes, making figure scenes of all sorts of different scales. Thinking about how compositions that are made like his can hold together, thinking about color, and thinking about what his place is going to be I would say in the history of French painting.<br>Caitlin Haskell:<br>Pursuing a type of painting that you personally can believe in and that you can really stand behind trying to be modern while also working through traditions of painting and being willing to do something that absolutely did not make sense to most of the people who saw it during his lifetime, but that reinvented and revolutionized what it meant to make a painting, what it means to communicate and how we share our sensations and emotions with each other through art.</p>\n",
