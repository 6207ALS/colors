    "description": "<p>Since the 1970s, Jenny Holzer has used language as her medium of choice to communicate penetrating ideas about life and death, sex, power, and war. Like contemporaries including Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, and Cindy Sherman, she appropriates mass media and advertising strategies in her work. Holzer rose to prominence with her <em>Truisms</em> series (1977\u201379), which consisted of nearly three hundred aphorisms and slogans that play on commonly held truths and clich\u00e9s such as \u201cA lot of professionals are crackpots\u201d and \u201cA man can\u2019t know what it is like to be a mother.\u201d Displayed as anonymous broadsides on buildings, fences, and walls throughout Manhattan, these statements were meant to provoke public debate. In her more recent work, Holzer continues to use language and current modes of communication to assail established ideas about art\u2019s place, audience, and meaning in modern society. Her texts have appeared on benches, billboards, Internet sites, posters, sarcophagi, in the form of monumental Xenon projections, and, most commonly, as LED (light-emitting diode) signs.<br><em>Blue Tilt</em> features texts from five of Holzer\u2019s iconic series: <em>Truisms</em>; <em>Inflammatory Essays</em> (1979\u201382), one hundred words in twenty lines inspired by the literature of Emma Goldman, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, Mao, and others, also printed on posters; <em>Living</em> (1980\u201382), matter-of-fact writings on \u201ceveryday life with a twist\u201d that were originally shown on cast-bronze plaques and hand-lettered metal signs; the urgent <em>Survival</em> (1983\u201385), which appeared on the Spectacolor board in New York\u2019s Times Square and was the first series the artist conceived for electronic signs; and the desperate <em>Under A Rock</em> (1986), which was engraved on stone benches shortly after Holzer\u2019s move to the countryside of upstate New York. Although all of these texts are the artist\u2019s invention, they do not necessarily reflect her personal views. Indeed, they employ a variety of contradictory voices, assuming a tone of anonymous authority in order to express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs in which truth is relative. <em>Blue Tilt</em> captures each of these signature moments in the medium most readily associated with Holzer\u2014the LED.<br>The structure of <em>Blue Tilt</em>\u2019s installation is architectural and dramatic, with imposing sixteen-foot, double-sided signs towering over viewers and bathing the entire space in the light of a relentless stream of words. \u201cOne reason I\u2019ve stayed with LEDs so long,\u201d remarked Holzer, \u201cis that part of the experience is that the light and words hit the body. This might give you vertigo; it might represent that there\u2019s always too much information and \u2018how do I process it?\u2019 It could make you unsure of the floor; I try to use reflections to that end.\u201d Under her control, the gallery becomes a stage that at once creates and serves an audience that can no longer make itself comfortable.</p>\n",
