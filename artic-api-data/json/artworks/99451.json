    "description": "<p>Franz Roh, an art historian, likely took up photography after encountering the ideas of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, and he soon became an influential advocate for experimental camera work in his own right. His fascination with negative prints and the practice of rounding the corners of his pictures recalls photographic work of the mid-1800s, which Roh collected as study material. Although he wrote and lectured on photography, and even founded a (short-lived) series of monographs on photographers, Roh rarely publicized his own work, which letters to friends indicate he viewed as a creative amusement./</p>\n",
