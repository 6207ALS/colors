    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This pale green writing box or pen case comes to us from the Qing dynasty China\u2019s last imperial era. Qing monochrome porcelain such as this are among the most elegant ceramics ever produced. Looking carefully, you\u2019ll see delicately molded designs a dragon amid clouds on the cover, and twisted rope in what\u2019s called a Key Fret pattern around the sides of the container. But curator Elinor Pearlstein notes that the function of pieces of this is still a bit of a puzzle.<br>Elinor Pearlstein:  No one really seems to have thought about their usage because their early examples in blue and white that seem to be modeled directly after Middle Eastern metal examples. It\u2019s thought that those were not used for Chinese writing at all but made for Muslims in China because the compartments are so small they would not have been suitable for Chinese style ink and brush.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The rectangular opening probably held water. And the three round containers were probably designed to contain colored inks.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN: Interestingly someone suggested to me that it might be a Chinese version of a Jesuit\u2019s pen and ink box because it\u2019s at this time in the eighteenth century when the Jesuits were very active at the court.</p>\n",
