    "copy": " Take the Art Institute\u2019s St. Martin and the Beggar , for example.   Look at the electric blue of the sky, the confident brushwork, the unnatural shape of the beggar\u2019s body. How does an artist find their distinctive style or voice, those qualities that identify the maker with a single glance? Domenikos Theotokopoulos (1541\u20131614), the artist known as El Greco, didn\u2019t always paint in this bold, exuberant style. Like any aspiring artist, he developed his artistic signature over a period of years, first by mastering the art of Byzantine icon painting, then by studying the work of established artists in Venice and Rome. After years of work and experimentation, punctuated by professional ups and downs, he arrived at the way of painting for which he\u2019s known today.   Born on the Greek island of Crete, El Greco likely underwent a traditional apprenticeship as a young man in which he learned to produce Byzantine icons. Working in this mode, El Greco produced small scenes of religious stories painted in tempera on wood panels. Featuring figures set against flat, gilded backgrounds, these small objects were generally used as personal devotional aids used to focus a viewer\u2019s attention during prayer.   St. Luke Painting the Virgin is a rare surviving example of El Greco\u2019s work from this period. The image includes a few hallmarks of icon painting: look at the drapery, painted in white on red, of St. Luke\u2019s robe. Yet we can also see where El Greco attempted to create three-dimensional space\u2014in the receding easel on which the saint has comfortably rested his foot, or the stool beneath the painting, with a paintbox gently resting on it.   In 1567, El Greco moved from Crete to Venice, leaving behind a successful career\u2014he had earned the title of \u201cmaster painter\u201d\u2014to develop his skills in a new setting. The painters Titian , Tintoretto , and Jacopo Bassano dominated the scene in Venice. Their loose brushwork and rich palettes radically diverged from the artifice of icon painting. In Venice, El Greco emulated these older painters, at times even quoting directly from their compositions by including similarly posed figures. Like many artists before and since, El Greco found careful study of established artists\u2019 work an effective way to hone his skills in pursuit of his own vision.   In the Art Institute\u2019s monumental painting The Assumption of the Virgin , we see El Greco\u2019s artistic abilities fully realized. The powerful figure of Mary looms above the viewer, her arms stretched wide, her body draped in great swaths of blue cloth. Carefully articulated figures fill the space behind and below her. El Greco painted the work as an altarpiece for the convent of Santo Domingo el Antiguo in Toledo, Spain\u2014a major commission he received in 1577. The artist moved from Italy to Spain, likely due to a failure to secure major patronage. Despite this professional disappointment, he persisted in his attempt to make a name for himself in a new setting.   El Greco\u2019s unmistakable style took years of experimentation to refine. And in the centuries since his death, his work has influenced scores of artists\u2014such as Manet, Van Gogh, and Picasso\u2014heightening the fact that art is not a static or isolated occurrence. While an artist might refine their practice in solitude, their work in fact reflects a conversation across time and culture. If you are a painter, writer, or artist of another sort hoping to discover your individual voice, you might do well to copy artists of the past and unpack their craft. In studying the work of others, you may well find your own singular vision. \u2014Ginia Sweeney, assistant director of interpretation ",
