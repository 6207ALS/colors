In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 57.1, fig. 57.2, and fig. 57.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa Suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see fig. 57.4) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin (see cat. 57.1) and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy (see cat. 57.2), Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. The analysis that follows of what the print depicts relies on a 1921 impression (cat. 57.3), which conveys all of the information that Gauguin inscribed and carved into the woodblock. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nWhile Gauguin evidently did not include his 1891 painting Upa upa (The Fire Dance) (fig. 57.5 [W 433]) in the Durand-Ruel exhibition, he decided to use it as the basis for the seventh image of the Noa Noa Suite, which he titled Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57.1, cat. 57.2, cat. 57.3). Simplified and reversed on account of the printing process, the print repeats Upa upa\u2019s nocturnal composition almost exactly, except for eliminating details in the painting that suggest a deep recession into depth on the right. Absent from the print are three figures in the right middle ground, and several additional bonfires and tiny figures in the far distance.\n\nIn the print, eight seated figures\u2014four at the left and four at the right\u2014occupy the foreground, their forms defined by the flickering light cast by a blazing fire. On the left are two sets of figures. An amorous couple embraces tightly at the far left; the woman\u2019s head tilts back at an angle that reveals her face and hair, which falls into the crook of her partner\u2019s right arm. The other pair seems to be conversing or gossiping; one, facing forward, leans toward the other, whom we see from behind. Below these four figures, the artist inserted his monogram, PGo, and the wood-block print\u2019s title. Above them close parallel lines most likely define the sky.\n\nIn the middle of the print\u2019s composition, the diagonal trunk of a coconut palm (see fig. 57.6) extends from left to right, dividing foreground from background. Gauguin\u2019s device of placing a diagonal tree trunk or branch in a scene to introduce drama and compositional complexity, as well as to create frames for various motifs and to flatten space, dates back most famously to his 1888 painting Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 57.7 [W 245]).\n\nClosest to the viewer are four figures in another conversational group. The two outer figures face forward, while the two in the middle, both of whom wear pleated hats, appear to stare into the intense fire, whose flames extend upward and whose sparks fan out (although the small diagonal lines could also indicate smoke). Preliminary notations related to the onlookers in the painting and print are found on pages of Gauguin\u2019s circa 1892\u201393 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook) (fig. 57.8, fig. 57.9, and fig. 57.10) and in the abat-jour-shaped design pasted onto page 173 (fol. 191R) of his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 57.11). The Carnet de Tahiti also contains a page with a summary drawing in graphite, showing a standing figure tending a fire with flickering flames and/or billowing smoke, which the artist annotated with notations on color and the like (fig. 57.12).\n\nIn the upper right of Mahna no varua ino are two dancers. Like the earliest European explorers of Polynesia, Gauguin was deeply interested in the region\u2019s social and religious customs, including dances; an early engraving (fig. 57.13) shows performers wearing traditional bark-cloth costumes. By the time Gauguin went to Tahiti, Christian missionaries, who had arrived there nearly a century before, had either Europeanized native dances by making performers cover themselves with Western-style clothing or had suppressed certain dances entirely, not only to discourage indigenous religious practices but also to do away with what they saw as violent and/or overtly sexual, and therefore unacceptable, forms of behavior. Perhaps the most objectionable dance was the upa upa, a cathartic ritual dance involving erotic movements suggesting copulation. The Europeans did not succeed in eradicating the upa upa entirely; it was reenacted for foreigners (see fig. 57.14 and fig. 57.15), and perhaps done clandestinely at night, using bonfires for illumination, as Gauguin\u2019s painting and print might indicate. The dancing pair\u2014wearing native, not missionary costumes\u2014demonstrate two central movements of the dance: performers bent their legs to create a diamond shape and moved their knees in and out rapidly (such as the figure at near the edge of the composition); they also lifted their arms and shook their hips from side to side with speed and fluidity (the dancer nearer to the tree trunk). Gauguin\u2019s choice of a title for his woodcut depiction of the upa upa that refers to the devil perhaps indicates a level of satire on his part: It was not until missionaries took Christianity to Tahiti that the natives were made to think of this dance as unholy, an invitation to sin.\n\nDuring his first sojourn in Polynesia, Gauguin often depicted dancers in sketches (see fig. 57.16 and fig. 57.17 [Rewald 41]) and paintings. In two 1892 canvases, Mata mua (In Olden Times) (fig. 57.18 [W 467]) and Arearea (Joyousness) (fig. 57.19 [W 468]), and a study for the latter (fig. 57.20), the artist visualized them dancing as a form of worship in the presence of an imagined, monumental statue of the moon goddess, Hina, in a setting that suggests the setting of his home in Mataeia. Arearea was displayed prominently in Gauguin\u2019s studio on rue Verging\u00e9torix (see fig. 57.3). Upa upa dancers appear again, but not in the presence of a statue of Hina, in the 1892 Women at the River Bank (fig. 57.21 [W 574]).\n\nAfter his return to Paris, Gauguin reprised the motif of upa upa performers in a fan design (fig. 57.22) [W 469]), informed by Arearea. Dancers feature in three 1894 paintings: Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (fig. 57.23 [cat. 72]), Arearea no varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 57.24 [W 514]), and Nave nave moe (Sweet Dreams) (fig. 57.25 [W 512]). An 1894 watercolor transfer monotype, Tahitian Landscape with Five Figures, which derives from Women at the River Bank, includes a group of dancers executing the upa upa in front of a grove of trees (fig. 57.26). A letter from Gauguin to an unnamed collector dated 1896 is illustrated with sketches (fig. 57.27) based on Arearea no varua ino, including that painting\u2019s two dancers. Gauguin\u2019s fondness for the motif of dancing figures may have been his way of bringing to life a vital tradition whose disappearance he lamented.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The title of this plate, inscribed in capital letters at the bottom left near Gauguin\u2019s monogram, is generally translated as \u201cThe day of the evil spirit.\u201d Mahna appears to be a hapax and thus can be explained as a misspelling of mahana, a word meaning \u201csun\u201d or \u201cday,\u201d which Gauguin used in other titles, including that of his 1894 painting Mahana no atua (The Day of the God) (fig. 57.28 [cat. 72]). V\u0101rua means \u201csoul, spirit\u201d and \u2018ino \u201cbad, evil,\u201d but the latter can also be used ironically or as an intensifier. Thus, Hiriata Millaud suggested v\u0101rua\u2018ino might be translated as \u201cpure,\u201d \u201cextreme,\u201d or \u201ctotal\u201d spirit. Nonetheless, v\u0101rua \u2018ino is employed as a compound word to designate a malevolent spirit or ghost. Robert Louis Stevenson defined \u201cthe Polynesian varua ino or aitu o le vao\u201d as \u201cthe near kinsman of the Transylvanian vampire\u201d in In the South Seas, his account of his 1888 and 1889 cruises. A v\u0101rua \u2018ino features in the title of several other works by Gauguin, one of which, Parau na te varua ino (fig. 57.29 [W 458]), was shown in his 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel, Paris; the catalogue translated its title as \u201cParoles du Diable\u201d (Words of the Devil). It must be added that the \u201csuperstitions\u201d ascribed to Tahitians, which Gauguin tended to consider in the same non-judgmental way as he had those of the rural Bretons, can be understood as survivals of pre-Christian beliefs and their \u201cdevils\u201d as dethroned deities. An 1821 report on the state of the evangelical missions in Oceania had noted with satisfaction that the local gods had \u201cfallen into the greatest discredit\u201d and that people no longer hesitated \u201cto call them evil spirits.\u201d\n\nMahna no varua ino is unequivocally a night scene. It is the darkest plate of the whole Noa Noa Suite, so that mahana, as \u201csun\u201d or \u201cday,\u201d seems paradoxical. But Tepano Jaussen\u2019s 1861 Tahitian-French dictionary also mentions a secondary meaning, \u201cheat,\u201d which would appear logical in connection with the fire depicted in the image, and \u201cday\u201d can be understood in the metaphorical sense of \u201cmoment.\u201d In addition, Millaud argued that Gauguin may have employed mahna to pun on mana, \u201cpower.\u201d\n\nThe composition is a simplified version of the painting Upa upa (The Fire Dance) (fig. 57.30 [W 433]; see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), with a reduced number of figures and a less detailed background. The indeterminacy of the setting was clearly important to Gauguin, who increased this effect by various means when pulling his own impressions of the print (see fig. 57.31 [Kornfeld 19]). Beyond the fact that what we see is taking place out of doors and that a coconut tree extends obliquely across the middle of the space, nothing can be surmised about the place and circumstances. As was often the case, the artist wanted to convey an atmosphere rather than describe particulars, but here the mystery may also refer to a situation of clandestinity, since the \u2018upa\u2018upa dance was actively repressed by the religious and civil authorities. In 1879 Julien Viaud (Pierre Loti) described the \u201cindecent\u201d and \u201cfrenetic\u201d dance that the French governor had, in vain, tried to prohibit. The narrator of The Marriage of Loti joined a circle formed around female dancers in the moonlight, accompanied by his young Tahitian lover, Rarahu, who preferred to remain seated and yet became \u201canother creature\u201d as the \u2018upa\u2018upa \u201cwoke deep in her uneducated soul feverish lust and savagery.\u201d The performance could thus effect through the senses the kind of anamnesis, or return of what has been repressed, that Gauguin was striving for (see cat. 55, Commentary). We do not know to what extent the artist could rely on direct evidence for his evocation of the \u2018upa\u2018upa, but commentators have rightly observed that he did not distinguish between the sacred and mundane dimensions of this \u201ccathartic form of pagan devotion.\u201d For Stephen Eisenman, Mahna no varua ino makes \u201ca historical and political claim: that regardless of the present rule of police or church, the pleasures of love (note the embracing figures at far left), and the sanctity of ancient religion, will win out.\u201d\n\nIn the painting, the faces and lower parts of the couple in a tight embrace at the right reflect the red of the fire, making explicit the connection between heat, dance, and sexual union. In Loti\u2019s novel, the \u2018upa\u2018upa spectacle \u201cburned Rarahu\u2019s blood,\u201d and Gauguin\u2019s various writings weave a network of metaphors between the volcano, the potter\u2019s kiln, sex, and artistic creativity. The love-making couple must have been particularly important to him, since it reappears as the main motif of Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (fig. 57.32 [cat. 58.1]), another plate of the Noa Noa Suite. This is all the more striking since there are only ten plates. Upa upa was not included in the 1893 exhibition of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian works in Paris, and the subject matter does not refer explicitly to any passage in the Noa Noa text. In Te faruru, a supernatural face in profile looms above the male lover\u2019s head, and Gauguin intimated this uncanny presence in some impressions of Mahna no varua ino (see cat. 57.1) by producing chance optical and textural effects with the help of wax.\n\nThe two seated figures placed just above the title seem to take the path indicated by the love-making couple, since one of them leans against the other. On the right side of the print and in the foreground sits a group of four figures, two of whom (on either side) show their faces, while the remaining ones are turned toward the fire. The mighty and sinuous trunk of the coconut palm passes above their heads and visually separates them\u2014as well as the dancers\u2014from the main part of the fire rising to the top of the plate. This repoussoir severs two spatial planes and dramatizes the tonal contrast of fire and night. But it is more than a compositional device and has been justly compared (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works) with the tree that separates Breton women from their vision in Gauguin\u2019s Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 57.33 [W 245]). Charles Stuckey proposed to connect the two dancing figures of Upa upa with these two wrestling figures, who indeed look like a four-legged animal. But equally important is the fact that, in both cases, the tree draws a line and mediates between spectators and spectacle, visionaries and vision.\n\nAre there reasons to consider the bonfire of Upa upa and Mahna no varua ino as a \u201cvision\u201d? Its size is certainly impressive, and the painting expands it into a pool of liquid lava. In the print, it has a more self-contained outline, distinguished from the sparks and smoke that extend from it like wings, but is all the more distinctive as a form. Henri Dorra compared Upa upa with what he considered as a preparatory drawing for it (fig. 57.34), in which seated Tahitian spectators encircle an idol-like figure and a group of dancers. He thought he could recognize the idol \u201cin the turbulence of the central flame\u201d of the painting: \u201c. . . two reddish lines hinting at a mouth and three bluish stains suggesting asymmetrical eyes and a nose. It is as if the flame were the embodiment of a seated deity endowed with a large face and a small body.\u201d Dorra found the motif repeated in Mahna no varua ino, \u201calbeit with less distinct anthropomorphic features,\u201d and Elizabeth Prelinger described it as \u201ca flame shaped like a hand.\u201d\n\nFor Gauguin, suggestion was an artistic strategy and a mode of communication. He agreed with the Symbolist poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s estimation of its superiority over description (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d), and these subjective responses do justice to this tenet. Fire\u2014like the associated embers, smoke, and clouds\u2014belongs moreover to the natural phenomena conducive to imaginative perception, and visions provoked by gazing at one have been described by countless authors from Philostratus to George Sand. Leonardo included fire on a list of objects that he believed stimulated the imagination and helped artists \u201cinvent\u201d landscapes, figures, and scenes. Gauguin may have wished to reflect on this property and its effects, which are felt in the two spectators absorbed by the spectacle of the flames. He could even have been aware of divinatory uses of fire, since E. S. Craighill Handy later reported that, in Polynesia, \u201cknowledge of future or distant events\u201d came to the psychically gifted in dreams, in a trance state, or \u201cthrough gazing into a reflecting liquid or into a sacred fire.\u201d\n\nThe anthropomorphic aspects perceived by Dorra and Prelinger in Gauguin\u2019s representations of the fire were at best intimations on his part and can be fundamentally disputed. Dorra\u2019s intuition of a relation between the fire and a divine presence, however, is worth pursuing, all the more as the artist took great care in animating the fire of Mahna no varua ino by pressing the paper into the cavities of the wood block and printing the crests left by his gouge. Gauguin knew from reading Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 Voyages aux \u00eeles du Grand Oc\u00e9an that ancient Polynesians did not represent their higher deities in anthropomorphic form, and, although he chose to figure large statues of Hina based on images of deified ancestors (see cat. 53, Commentary, and cat. 58, Commentary), he took a keen interest in aniconic or abstract manifestations of the divine. In his compilation of excerpts from Moerenhout, the 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion), he illustrated the belt of red feathers (maro \u2018ura) that was an \u201cimage of the godhead and of fire\u201d (fig. 57.35), making its wearer \u201calmost the equal of the gods,\u201d as well as depicting the metamorphosis of the war god \u2018Oro into \u201can immense column of fire\u201d (fig. 57.36).\n\nTaking into account the reversal produced by the printing process, the column of fire can be compared to the other light area in Mahna no varua ino, the unidentified shape at the left, which the impressions printed by Louis Roy emphasize either with the same color as the fire itself (see cat. 57.2) or with a different one (see fig. 57.37). Aniconism\u2014the avoidance of mimetic imagery\u2014is an important tendency in monotheistic religions, and an aniconic theophany features prominently in the Jewish Bible with the episode of the Burning Bush (Exodus 3:1\u20136), in which Jehovah calls to Moses from within a bush that burns with fire but is not consumed. This biblical scene challenges representation and has been rarely treated in art (see fig. 57.38), but Gauguin was certainly aware of it and may have had it in mind when lending a numinous quality to his bonfire.\n\nAnother potential image worth inquiring into was noted by Stephen Eisenman when he described the coconut palm bisecting the fire as \u201ca great, phallic tree\u201d leaning \u201cat a suggestive angle.\u201d This is not a suggestion that seems relevant for the tree in Vision of the Sermon, but in other works by Gauguin, such as the 1889 Landscape with Two Breton Women (fig. 57.39), a close look at the \u201canatomy\u201d of a leaning tree makes it very plausible. In the case of Upa upa and Mahna no varua ino, an allusion to an aroused sexual organ would be logical in connection with the \u201cobscene\u201d quality of the dance, the excitement it generates, and the amorous activities unfolding on the other side of the tree. This sexual reading of the scene is in no way incompatible with the religious one, and the size of this botanic erection gives it a monumentality in proportion with that of the sacred fire. In his 1893 manuscript Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline), begun at the end of his first stay in Tahiti, Gauguin advocated free love and wrote that the \u201csin\u201d of giving one\u2019s body \u201cis amply redeemed by the most beautiful act in the world, creation, which is a divine act in that it is a continuation of the Creator\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nSince the v\u0101rua \u2018ino of the title is not explicitly represented in the print, as it is in Parau na te varua ino and in other works, one may conclude that it is (in) the fire. Impressions of the first and second states of Mahna no varua ino (see fig. 57.40 [Kornfeld 19]) show that the central part of the fire\u2014Prelinger\u2019s \u201chand-like flame\u201d\u2014was there from the start. In view of this beacon piercing the night, Millaud\u2019s hypothesis of a conflation of mana (power) and mahana (day, sun, heat)\u2014a verbal pun paralleling the visual ones in the image\u2014appears justified. It is also clear that the fire possesses the value of a figure, and oddities of its printing suggest that it may have played a role in the emergence of one of Gauguin\u2019s most puzzling creations, the androgynous, idol-like Oviri, which first took form on paper before being burned in the great fire of the kiln as a \u201cceramic sculpture\u201d (fig. 57.41 [Gray 113]). The two impressions of the Oviri wood-block print that Gauguin pasted side-by-side onto cardboard and dedicated to Mallarm\u00e9 (fig. 57.42) were printed on the verso of two Roy impressions of Mahna no varua ino, cropped in such a way that the fire motif appears on both, but head to tail (fig. 57.43). Seen in reverse, the fire displays a general resemblance of outline with that of the Oviri figure, whose head is rounded like the (strange) bottom of the fire and whose legs dissolve like the forking flames. The visual connection between Oviri and Mahna no varua ino is admittedly slight, but it gains support from the fact that a double-face link between the two prints is repeated in at least two other cases: an impression of Oviri (fig. 57.44) on the back of a cropped impression of Mahna no varua ino (fig. 57.45)\u2014emphasizing in this case the \u201ccolumn of fire\u201d and the love-making couple\u2014and a double impression of Oviri (fig. 57.46) on the verso of a complete impression of Mahna no varua ino (fig. 57.47).\n\nThis coincidence may be explained by issues of timing and expediency, but it could also indicate that Gauguin used his own work as a divination device and that the flickering and dancing embodiment of a primeval force\u00ad\u00ad\u2014both indigenous and universal\u2014that he pursued in the bonfire of Upa upa and Mahna no varua ino found in the \u201ccruel enigma\u201d of Oviri a more iconic, but no less inchoate and changing, avatar.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This impression was printed by Louis Roy in spring\u2013summer 1894 as part of an edition of about 25\u201330 impressions.\n\nIn the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . . An entrance space led to the studio. . . . This rather vast room, painted entirely in bright chrome yellow\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014created an immediate impression of strangeness and unpredicatability. On the walls, smeared with barbaric canvases.)\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), pp. 123\u201324. Colta Ives identified the man at the lower left corner of the photo as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten woodblock prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the woodcuts do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Moser, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 2013), p. 92.\n\nThere are only two references to the painting Upa upa dating from Gauguin\u2019s lifetime: on page 2 (fol. 2R), no. 6, in a list of his paintings in his 1892\u201393 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook); and the sale catalogue Vente de tableaux et dessins par Paul Gauguin (H\u00f4tel Drouot, Feb. 18, 1895), which lists Feux de joies (Fires of Joy) under no. 36. The title Gauguin carved into the boxwood matrix of the print very likely influenced the French and English titles assigned to the painting by other parties after his death, in 1903. See Richard S. Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Trip to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), no. 9, p. 312.\n\nThese figures may be dancing or tending to another bonfire.\n\nSee Elizabeth Childs, Vanishing Paradise: Art and Exoticism in Colonial Tahiti (University of California Press, 2013), p. 30.\n\nDifferences in plant growth in these two photographs indicate that they depict reenactments of the upa upa in the same location but on separate occasions.\n\nThe early nineteenth-century explorer/anthropologist Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, who visited Tahiti, described nocturnal scenes of dancers performing by torchlight; he also mentioned seeing dances in which performers were totally nude. See Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 2, sec. 3, \u201cPlaisirs,\u201d pp. 126\u201332. For Charles F. Stuckey, Gauguin\u2019s image is mainly imaginary; Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cUpaupa,\u201d in Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream, ed. Stephen F. Eisenman, exh. cat. (Skira, 2007), p. 276, cat. 66. For more on the government\u2019s suppression of native practices, see Patrick O\u2019Reilly, Dance in Tahiti (Nouvelles \u00c9d. Latines, 1977), pp. 14\u201315, 18.\n\nRichard Field pointed to evidence that Gauguin owned a photographic postcard of such a scene, possibly one photographed by Charles-George Spitz and then hand-colored and published by Frank Homes (fig. 57.15). After Spitz\u2019s death in 1894, Homes managed Spitz\u2019s photographic establishment until 1900. See Richard S. Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Trip to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), p. 312, no. 9; p. [424], no. 6.\n\nBoth Mata mua (In Olden Times) and Arearea (Joyousness) were included in Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Paul Gauguin, exh. cat. (Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893), nos. 6 and 8, respectively, but neither sold.\n\nIn addition to the dancing figures at the right of this sheet, the dog features as well in Arearea (Joyousness) (fig. 57.21). The amaryllis flowers (Hippeastrum) at the top and bottom appear in the 1892 painting Pastorales tahitiennes (Tahitian Pastorals) (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W 470]) and in the 1894 oil Nave nave moe (Sweet Dreams) (fig. 57.25).\n\nSee Bengt Danielsson, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Tahitian Titles,\u201d Burlington Magazine 109, no. 769 (Apr. 1967), p. 231, no. 26.\n\nHiriata Millaud, \u201cLes titres tahitiens de Gauguin,\u201d in Ia orana Gauguin, exh. cat.

Bengt Danielsson observed that the title inscribed on the painting should be translated as \u201cTalk of (=by) the evil spirit\u201d and the one printed in the catalogue as \u201cTalk about the evil spirit\u201d; Danielsson, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Tahitian Titles,\u201d Burlington Magazine 109, no. 769 (Apr. 1967), p. 232, no. 47. However, he did not imagine that Gauguin might have intended the ambiguous agency expressed by this double title, although it is typical of the artist (see cat. 55, Commentary; cat. 59, Commentary; cat. 60, Commentary).\n\nExpos\u00e9 de l\u2019\u00e9tat actuel desmissions \u00e9vang\u00e9liques chez les peuples infid\u00e8les (Guillaume Fick, 1821), p. 303.

Millaud observed that this would imply a command of the Tahitian language that \u201cfew Westerners could have possessed at the time,\u201d but Gauguin was fond of puns, both verbal and visual, and one may add that aural similitudes are among the first features noted by anyone learning a new language. Moreover, \u201cMAHNA\u201d is carefully carved into the wood block, and this makes a misspelling improbable.\n\nSee Dance in Tahiti (Nouvelles \u00c9d.

Gauguin did not copy the description and explanations given by Moerenhout about the maro \u2018ura, and he transformed his source\u2019s \u201cimage of the diety and of fire\u201d (\u201cimage de la divinit\u00e9 et du feu\u201d) into a \u201csymbol\u201d of the same, probably restricting the use of \u201cimage\u201d to its iconic sense. Following this usage, the fire in Mahna no varua ino might be considered a symbol, rather than an image, of the v\u0101rua \u2018ino.\n\nThe episode of the burning bush, in which \u201cthe angel of the Lord\u201d first appears and from which the voice of God is heard, could also be brought to bear on the motif of a bush with the intimation of facial features present in several works by Gauguin, including his 1888 painting Arl\u00e9siennes (Mistral) (cat. 10); see Dario Gamboni, Paul Gauguin: The Mysterious Centre of Thought, trans.
