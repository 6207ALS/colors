    "description": "<p>Zhang Wei was a critical figure in the development of avant-garde art in China. Self-trained, he began his career as a key member of the No Name Art Group, which was the most significant clandestine artists\u2019 group formed in the early 1970s. After leaving its ranks in 1979, Zhang became one of the first artists in the country to make abstract paintings following the Cultural Revolution. His approach to abstraction is grounded in his knowledge of traditional Chinese ink painting, in which an emphasis is placed on expressing emotion through the gestural movement of the brush.</p>\n<p><em>AC10</em> depicts two glowing amorphous turquoise forms on a raw linen plane. The color is at once translucent and delicately built up. Zhang was interested in producing an allover composition in which the viewer cannot identify where that artist had begun or ended his mark making. He has discussed this particular painting with reference to power and art, remarking, \u201cThe big blue painting that I painted in 1984\u2014the one I love so much! . . . I borrowed that [concept of power] from the Chinese traditional mentality. There is this Chinese saying, \u2018power is formless.\u2019 That\u2019s my language too.\u201d Formless power is an apt description of the whole of Zhang\u2019s practice; from his first painting, his art has always been subversive. He worked always outside of China\u2019s official arts institutions, first as part of the No Name Art Group and later when he used his apartment as a makeshift salon and art gallery. In so doing, he became influential within the underground art movement of the early 1980s.</p>\n",
