His burial was accompanied by one of the most magnificent displays of wealth discovered in Greece in recent decades.&nbsp;The character of the objects that followed him to the afterlife prove that this part of Greece, like Mycenae, was being indelibly shaped by close contact with Crete.&nbsp;This was the time of the very birth of European civilization.</p><p>The warrior\u2019s tomb was discovered and excavated in summer 2015 by a team sponsored by the University of Cincinnati and made up of students, professors, and professional archaeologists from a dozen different universities, representing as many different nationalities. Project co-directors Sharon R. Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati note:&nbsp;\u201cThe team did not discover the grave of the legendary King Nestor, who headed a contingent in the Greek forces at Troy.&nbsp;Nor did it find the grave of his father, Neleus.&nbsp;They found something perhaps of even greater importance: the tomb of one of the powerful men&nbsp;who laid foundations for the Mycenaean civilization, the earliest in Europe.\u201d</p><p>This program is generously sponsored by the Boshell Family Foundation.</p><h2><strong>About the Speakers</strong></h2><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
