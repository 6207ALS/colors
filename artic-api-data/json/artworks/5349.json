    "description": "<p>This panoramic landscape depicts Gloucester, Massachusetts, one of Childe Hassam\u2019s favorite destinations. During the summer months Gloucester was home to many artists, who, like Hassam, chose to emphasize its picturesque aspects, such as its quaint architecture and sailing vessels rather than its fish-processing plants. The composition exhibits Hassam\u2019s broken brushwork and his use of bare canvas. Bright, saturated blues and crisp whites augment the maritime tenor of the work, while the square canvas highlights its architectonic quality and harmoniously organized space.</p>\n",
