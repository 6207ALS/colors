    "copy": " Her very medium\u2014textiles and embroidery\u2014stem from her late mother, who was a seamstress. Working intimately with the everyday materials of fabric and thread, Swaby considers her own practice to be an extension of her mother\u2019s legacy. Not only do her medium and methods grow from this most intimate of family relationships, but to date her life-sized embroidered portraits have depicted only the women in her life: friends, sisters, and someone she is most familiar with, herself. The Art Institute\u2019s presentation of Fresh Up , Swaby\u2019s first solo museum show, emphasizes this critical aspect of her work. The exhibition begins with Swaby\u2019s self-portrait exploration, Another Side to Me Second Chapter , which consists of six works from 2021. Using her characteristic style\u2014intricately rendered canvases that combine boldly patterned fabrics and freehand machine stitching worked on the reverse of the canvas, showing normally hidden knots and loose threads\u2014she depicts herself in each work greeting the viewer with a direct and level gaze. While she wears the same outfit throughout the series, her pose subtly changes, inviting the viewer to ponder what a different tilt of the head or gesture communicates.   Swaby\u2019s pictures feel simultaneously individualized and representative. The subjects are not identified by name, and while the choices of fashion and accessories are the deliberate outcome of the artist/sitter collaboration, they also allow the viewer to see a reflection of themselves in a hairdo, a pose, a pair of fashionable shoes. Brooke C. Obie, writing about the Love Letter series in the Winter 2022 issue of the Gagosian Quarterly , eloquently summarizes the impact of Swaby\u2019s work: \u201cThese portraits of Black women in Bantu knots, fades, and natural updos are ... made in fabric and thread stitched onto canvas, but the women are featureless, the outlines of their heads and necks filled with quilted flower and geometric patterns that feel simultaneously ancestral and modern, giving the women the ability to represent all the women in their lineage who came before them, as well as their present selves.\u201d While Swaby has conceptual goals for each of her series, she retains the flexibility to react to the needs of each work and each sitter. \"I try not to set any specific rules that must be followed for each portrait of a series. The portrait is about the person; it doesn\u2019t need to follow a set of rules that I have assigned. I approach each work with openness and try to give [it] what it might need\u2014for that person.\u2026 I think that\u2019s the point: to highlight aspects of each sitter and to celebrate who they are.\u201d   Swaby begins each work by sitting with the subject. These sessions, which involve both discussion and a photo shoot, are essential to her process. While she often already has a strong impression of the women she depicts, she uses the discussion to learn more about their histories and personalities and to build a shared vision for the final portraits. From there, she selects fabrics and patterns that express the sitters\u2019 individuality\u2014their style, tastes, temperament, and background. The artist started her series of full-length pictures, Love Letter and Pretty Pretty , by again creating self-portraits; she then expanded her choice of sitters, collaborating first with close friends and finally completing each series with depictions of her three older sisters. Swaby\u2019s sittings with her sisters happened during an intense three-day visit to Nassau, where the rest of the Swaby family lives. The sessions were, by the artist\u2019s own admission, both challenging and revealing. While she holds a strong sense of duty to all of the subjects of her work, that duty was amplified exponentially when it came to her sisters. Representing each of them in a way that was true to both their unique personas and her practice was truly a labor of love.   Of Love Letter 10 and Pretty Pretty 11 , portraits of the middle of her three older sisters, Swaby shared: \u201cIt was important to include her jewelry and her nails, especially in the Love Letter series. Jewelry is not always something that makes it into the rendering, but she\u2019s very much into glamour; it is a true hallmark of her presence. In our conversations about what she would wear, she would often talk about the jewelry first; I knew, for her, this was an important aspect of how she wants to present herself to the world. And the nails were essential; [her] nails are always done, no matter what. It\u2019s just an extension of her at this point, so it was necessary that I highlighted her nails in the Pretty Pretty series.\u201d   The sister to whom Swaby bears the most resemblance is the oldest of the four women; people often mistake one of them for the other. Love Letter 9 and Pretty Pretty 10 emphasize this resemblance. \u201cThe hair is a critical aspect of this portrait to me. I have self-portraits with the same hairstyle, and we both wear our hair like this pretty often. I went natural first\u2014which means that I stopped relaxing my hair and I let the natural texture grow out\u2014and [several years] later she also went natural. I felt like it was a way that we really connected with each other; we became closer talking about hair, sharing products and techniques.\u201d   For the youngest of the three sisters, shown in Love Letter 8 and Pretty Pretty 12 , the confident pose became a foundational element of the two works. \u201cThe clothing choices show a lot of duality, but the poses are similar. The Pretty Pretty portrait is a more everyday, casual look. The dress is one of her favorites, and it was a way to memorialize this wonderful outfit that\u2019s made her feel really beautiful and really strong.... The Love Letter portrait is something she would wear to feel glamorous and to illustrate a kind of charisma, so I wanted to go really bright and really bold. I wanted to capture these two sides of her \u2026 and to capture a snapshot in time that she could perhaps reflect on.\u201d While the process with Swaby\u2019s sisters required a bit more give-and-take than most of her portraits, Swaby held steadfast to her own working methods and standards, resisting small requests from her older siblings to edit or augment the works. Her judgment was rewarded by the success of the finished portraits and the satisfaction and delight they elicited from her family.   Because of travel restrictions during the pandemic, none of the women were in the same space together until the Fresh Up tour opened in May of 2022 at the Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg. Even then, only three of the four could be present. We hope to welcome all of the Swaby sisters to Chicago to celebrate Swaby, her evolving practice, and her commitment to creating works that prompt positivity, Black joy, and healing. \u2014Melinda Watt, Chair and Christa C.
