    "description": "<p>This painting by Swiss artist Henry Fuseli depicts 17th-century English poet John Milton, who became blind in his 40s, dictating his epic poem <em>Paradise Lost</em>. His daughter transcribes his words while another woman listens intently as she sews. A forerunner of the Romantic Movement, Fuseli created drama through chromatic contrast. A cool light illuminates the rosy-cheeked women and casts deep shadows around Milton\u2019s ghostly figure and face. Fuseli created this painting for his Milton Gallery, a self-run enterprise that showcased the artist\u2019s Milton-inspired works. While this entrepreneurial venture failed commercially, it raised Fuseli\u2019s prestige and visibility as an artist.</p>\n",
