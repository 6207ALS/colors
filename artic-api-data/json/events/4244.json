    "description": "<p>Vocalist and composer Imani Uzuri\u2019s improvisational conceptual project, WILD COTTON explores the imagined, undocumented soundscapes of enslaved black American ancestors that still haunt us today. In response to Dawoud Bey\u2019s exhibition <em>Night Coming Tenderly, Black</em>, Uzuri presents a specially curated immersive presentation of WILD COTTON. This performance will sonically illuminate the underlying theme of African American resistance reflected in Bey\u2019s series, adding a musical layer and aural context to the exhibition.</p><p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p>Raised in rural North Carolina,<strong> Imani Uzuri</strong> is an award-winning vocalist, composer, librettist, and improviser called \u201ca postmodernist Bessie Smith\" by the <em>Village Voice</em>.
