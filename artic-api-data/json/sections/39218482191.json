Arched brows, drooping eyelids, and a faint half smile give the subject a look of amused skepticism; a dark mole and slight double chin mark her as an individual. An unmodulated green background and barely sketched lower portion announce the picture\u2019s unresolved status. But they also lend this composition a peculiar freshness and immediacy, as if granting the observer a glimpse over the shoulder of the artist at work. Having laid in the figure with fluid strokes of dark paint, Manet added very little further information to the bottom half of the canvas. He allowed a few lines to suggest his sitter\u2019s hand, crossed forearms, and the contours of her body beneath a light muslin bodice. The titular fichu, a square of fabric worn as a scarf, is no less openly painted; indeed, barely covered pentimenti on the young woman\u2019s throat (fig. 16.1) and proper right breast reveal an earlier scheme for the fall of the scarf. Manet lavished more care on her face. Here the surface is more consistently covered, with shorter, more precise strokes of color used to suggest soft, flushed cheeks, a shiny nose, and a fleshy mouth. Where the ground remains visible\u2014as, for example, in the whites of the sitter\u2019s eyes (fig. 16.2)\u2014its exposure is specific and tightly controlled (see Technical Report). Painted wet-in-wet, a fringe of bangs (fig. 16.3) and a pile of blue-black hair complete the likeness; the hairstyle and its fluid treatment suggest that this picture dates to the late 1870s (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revision).\n\nManet seems to have painted the picture on a scrap of prepared canvas, a remnant from the same bolt he had used for the very much larger Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher) (cat. 11) over a decade earlier (see Technical Report). In Woman with a Black Fichu, the weave of the fabric runs at a steep diagonal across the composition, suggesting that this piece of canvas was not commercially stretched. Pinholes visible along the edges (fig. 16.4) offer further evidence that the artist likely painted the picture on canvas pinned to a rigid support, stretching or having it stretched over a standard no. 12 frame only after the fact (see Weave). Had he brought this composition to a higher degree of finish, thick background paint might have helped camouflage the crooked weave. But as it is, the scrappy support provides further insight into Manet\u2019s working procedure.\n\nDescribed in an early catalogue of the artist\u2019s oeuvre as a \u201cpresumed portrait of Murer\u2019s sister,\u201d this work bears little resemblance to Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2019s 1877 portrait of Marie Murer (later Madame J\u00e9r\u00f4me Doucet; fig. 16.5), sister of the Impressionist collector Eug\u00e8ne Murer. Even taking into account Renoir\u2019s tendency to idealize his female subjects, there is little to support an identification of Manet\u2019s arch, raven-haired sitter with the auburn locks and even features of Mademoiselle Murer. Attempts to identify Woman with a Black Fichu as another lady of Manet\u2019s acquaintance, however, have been equally unsuccessful. Of course, the fact that she remains unidentified does not make this picture any less a portrait. The frankness and informality of the characterization encourage us to feel as though we have met this woman somewhere before; her smile\u2014almost a smirk, and certainly an unusual expression for a portrait of this period\u2014lingers in the memory.\n\nAfter the sitter\u2019s smile, the peculiar bright-green background is surely this picture\u2019s most striking characteristic. Laid on overall in a semitransparent wash, this backdrop was strengthened in areas around the sitter\u2019s head with more opaque paint of the same color. The wash overlaps the pink of her ears and the black of her hair in some places, but lies under them in others (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revision). Manet\u2019s careful adjustment of the figure\u2019s contours here is consistent with his approach to the figure/ground relationship throughout his career. The color itself, however, is almost unique in his oeuvre. Similarly colored backdrops appear in portraits by Hans Holbein and Agnolo Bronzino, but no finished picture by Manet features such a vivid green ground. Another unfinished composition, the peculiarly un-erotic Blonde with Bare Breasts (fig. 16.6; [RW I 287]), is staged before a comparable backdrop of thinned green paint. Had the artist finished these two pictures, he almost surely would have set them outdoors; in several finished outdoor portraits also painted around 1880, Manet laid in a backdrop of luxuriant foliage using washes of a similarly shocking shade. In Madame Manet at Bellevue (fig. 16.7; [RW I 397]), for example, a thin wash of acid green is visible beneath the thicket of background brushstrokes (fig. 16.8), and in Jeanne (Spring) (fig. 16.9; [RW I 372]) a similar layer of bright, transparent color peeks through the rhododendron leaves (fig. 16.10).\n\nPlainly left unfinished upon the artist\u2019s death, Woman with a Black Fichu was fortunate to escape the kind of posthumous retouching that many of Manet\u2019s unfinished works suffered. Like the presumed portrait of Jeanne Demarsy (fig. 16.11; [RW I 374])\u2014also left unfinished in the studio at the time of his death\u2014the Chicago portrait suggests an affinity between the artist\u2019s pastel and oil painting practices near the end of his life. Dense application in the face gives way to a more graphic, suggestive approach in the arms and hands, and strategically exposed ground helps build facial features. We find similar strategies in a roughly contemporary pastel portrait of M\u00e9ry Laurent (fig. 16.12; [RW II 76]) that once hung with Woman with a Black Fichu in the Paris apartment of Dr. Georges de Bellio, a steadfast supporter of Manet and the Impressionists.\n\nA Romanian aristocrat and medical doctor, de Bellio (n\u00e9 Bellu) moved from Bucharest to Paris in the 1850s and there established himself as an unofficial physician to the avant-garde. He began buying art in earnest around 1864, quickly gravitating to Claude Monet. De Bellio may have come to know Manet in the mid-1870s, when they both lent money to Monet. Much like Manet, de Bellio was remarkably generous to his friends, and over the course of the next two decades he offered free medical treatment to Manet, Monet, Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, and their families. Having shown the first signs of locomotor ataxia (a degeneration of the spinal cord affecting movement control) in 1879, Manet sought guidance from de Bellio, among other doctors, as he pursued an increasingly futile course of treatments. These culminated in the amputation of his left leg on March 25, 1883. After the artist\u2019s death little more than a month later, Madame Manet gave de Bellio one of his portraits of Berthe Morisot (RW I 228) as a token of gratitude. That work joined several others by Manet already in the doctor\u2019s collection. At the 1884 sale of Manet\u2019s studio contents, de Bellio purchased three pictures: Bust of a Woman (RW I 241); the pastel M\u00e9ry Laurent with a Pug (fig. 16.12); and Woman with a Black Fichu, titled T\u00eate de femme in the sale catalogue. This work can be identified as the Chicago portrait thanks to a photograph with L\u00e9on Leenhoff\u2019s annotations (fig. 16.13), including the corresponding lot number, 26. De Bellio paid 600 francs for it\u2014hardly an exorbitant price, though six times the abysmal estimate\u2014and hung it alongside other Manets, both oils and pastels, that shared its sense of intimacy and spontaneity.\n\nDe Bellio\u2019s particular interest in pastels and pastel-like paintings may be understood as an extension of his enthusiasm for eighteenth-century French art. His collection included genre paintings of the Dutch Golden Age and drawings attributed to Guercino and Nicolas Poussin, but its greatest strength outside the Impressionist school was eighteenth-century French art. He owned works by or attributed to Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Carle van Loo, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, Pierre-Paul Prud\u2019hon, and Jacques-Louis David. Noticeably absent from this list are the great pastel portraitists Maurice-Quentin de La Tour and Jean-Baptiste Perronneau, whose unusually forthright female portraits share a spiritual affinity with Woman with a Fichu (see, e.g., fig. 16.14). Manet could have seen fine examples of these artists\u2019 work in exhibitions of Old Master portraits and French drawings held in Paris in 1878 and 1879, respectively, or even in the growing permanent collection of the Louvre. The increased visibility of eighteenth-century pastels in modern Paris surely contributed to Manet\u2019s renewed interest in the pastel medium, and in bust-length portraiture more broadly, during the last years of his life. In this context, even his sitter\u2019s fichu\u2014a common enough accessory in Manet\u2019s day\u2014may be seen as a nod to the Rococo.\n\nUpon his death in 1894 de Bellio left the collection to Eug\u00e8ne Donop de Monchy, who had married de Bellio\u2019s daughter, Victorine. She inherited it in turn in 1942 and, in 1957, transformed the collections of the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet with the Donop de Monchy gift. By this time, however, Woman with a Black Fichu, which the family had retained until at least 1910, had parted ways with the rest of the collection. In 1919, it surfaced with Paul Rosenberg in Paris, and by 1931 it was part of the Chicago collection of Annie Swan Coburn. Of the seven Manets in her collection, a still life of fruit (RW I 120) ended up at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; a pastel portrait of a young man smoking a cigar (RW II 31) went to the Fogg Art Museum (now part of the Harvard Art Museums), and a second pastel portrait of a young woman (fig. 16.15)\u2014also from the de Bellio collection\u2014remains in private hands. But four pictures\u2014the early Portrait of the Lange Boy (RW I 61), the great Fish (Still Life) (cat. 2), the breathlessly brushed Woman Reading (cat. 19), and Woman with a Black Fichu\u2014all remained in Chicago, enriching already significant Manet holdings at the Art Institute.  \nEmily A. Beeny\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Portrait of a Woman with a Black Fichu was painted on a pre-primed no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. A warp-thread match was determined with Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865\u201367 (cat. 11), suggesting that the canvases for the two paintings came from the same bolt of fabric. The ground layer is off-white and probably consists of a single layer. Pinholes around the edges of the composition and a fairly significant rotation of the canvas may indicate that the work was painted unstretched. The work is loosely and openly painted with areas of exposed ground; thin washes of color; graphic brushstrokes; and thicker, more textural brushwork especially in the face. The artist made some adjustments to the contours of the head and the scarf using a thicker green paint than that originally used for the background. He also reworked areas of the face and neck, mostly around the perimeter, including the ears, which were painted wet-in-wet with the repainted area of the green background. The work is neither signed nor dated.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 16.16).\n\nThe work is not signed or dated.\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe dimensions are close to a no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (60 \u00d7 50 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.0V (0.7) \u00d7 26.5H (0.8) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was determined with Manet\u2019s Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865\u201367 (cat. 11).\n\nThere is moderate, fairly even cusping on all sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1962 treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced approximately 6\u20138.5 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: There appears to be more than one series of old tack holes. The canvas has deteriorated around several of the holes. A series of small pinholes was observed around the edges of the composition on all sides (fig. 16.17). This could be an indication that the work was pinned flat for execution and later mounted on the stretcher. The canvas was rotated significantly when the work was painted, so the threads are not exactly vertical and horizontal. This can be seen on the surface of the painting, especially with raking light (fig. 16.18).\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher; dates to 1962 treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The stretcher was documented as being five-membered with a horizontal crossbar.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed canvas, which was probably commercially prepared. In the two cross sections analyzed, differences in packing density and relative proportions of binder to pigments were observed in different regions of the samples. The overall thickness of the ground ranges from approximately 4\u201380 \u00b5m (fig. 16.19, fig. 16.20).\n\nOff-white (fig. 16.21). Black and brown particles are visible microscopically.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground consists of lead white with calcium carbonate (chalk) and traces of barium sulfate (barite) and calcium sulfate. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe presence of small pinholes around the edges of the composition and the somewhat askew canvas may indicate that Manet painted the work before it was mounted on the stretcher (see Original stretching). Overall, the work appears to have been relatively rapidly executed, using loose, open brushwork. Some small adjustments were made to the figure, however, indicating that the painting was carried out in more than one session. The green background consists of a very thin, brushmarked wash of color through which the canvas weave remains prominent. The background was added early in the painting process, probably when the figure was only summarily sketched in, since green paint extends under the edges of the dress and hair (fig. 16.22, fig. 16.23). Manet used a few graphic brushstrokes to indicate the general forms of the clothing (fig. 16.24). These earliest strokes appear to consist of a very dilute black paint that remains visible through thinly painted passages of the dress (fig. 16.25). The costume was then built up using washes of gray and flesh-toned paint to depict shadowed or more opaque areas of the clothing and flesh visible through the sheer fabric, respectively. The black fichu was similarly drawn in with a few black brushstrokes that define its borders. It was then built up in areas of more solid application of black paint, as well as more open areas where bluish-gray strokes are lightly dragged over the surface, leaving the ground exposed in places (fig. 16.26). Manet then added dark-blue and reddish-brown strokes to define some of the seams and folds in the garment, as well as the sitter\u2019s proper left hand, and the more opaque, textural strokes of lead white\u2013rich paint, which are often mixed with small amounts of blue and orange-red to form various shades of pale blue-gray and peach (fig. 16.27). The costume is very openly painted, and areas of exposed ground, underlayers that are left exposed or remain visible through thin paint applications, as well as surface brushstrokes, all contribute to the final form. The woman\u2019s face is built up with thicker, textured brushstrokes, but small areas of exposed ground provide the off-white tone of the whites of her eyes (fig. 16.28, fig. 16.29) and the flesh underneath her lips and nose (fig. 16.30). The hair is painted with relatively thin applications of black paint and some denser strokes of bluish-gray (fig. 16.31).\n\nManet made some adjustments around the woman\u2019s head and shoulders, reworking areas of the face, hair, and edges of the scarf. The artist used a thicker green paint mixture than in the first painting of the background to modify the contours of the hair and the scarf. A \u201chalo\u201d of this green paint is visible around the head and shoulders, and shows up as a dense area in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images (fig. 16.32). On the left and right shoulders, the original edges of the black scarf remain partially visible through the green paint. Some additional black brushstrokes were added to the scarf on top of the green (fig. 16.33). Manet reworked the perimeter of the face including the ears, which were repainted using a flesh-toned paint that mixed wet-in-wet with the repainted green background in places (fig. 16.34). These areas appear denser in the X-ray compared with the central part of the face (fig. 16.35). The eyebrows and the brow bones also appear to have been repainted, especially the proper right eyebrow where a dull-brown paint mostly covers the more varied tones of dark brown, dark blue, and reddish-brown underneath (fig. 16.36). The thick, flesh-toned paint on the forehead mixes wet-in-wet with some of the blue-gray strands of hair, suggesting that the bangs were reworked along with the forehead (fig. 16.37). Two dark outlining strokes of the scarf\u2014one on the near left side of the woman\u2019s neck and another on the upper left edge of the folded-over end of the scarf\u2014suggest that Manet diverged from his initial plan. These brushstrokes seem to have delineated the edges of the scarf in the early lay-in but were not then filled in. Instead the dark brushstrokes were partially painted over with the peachy-toned paint used on the neck and a couple of strokes of white paint farther down on the chest (fig. 16.38).\n\nBrushes, including approximately 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, Naples yellow, yellow and red iron oxides, vermilion, malachite (fig. 16.39), cobalt blue, cerulean blue, and bone black. The presence of an orangey-pink fluorescence under UV light indicates the localized use of red lake at the corners of the sitter\u2019s mouth.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished. A synthetic varnish applied in 1960 was removed in 2013 (see Conservation History). Prior to that, the painting was unvarnished. The painting has an overall matte surface with subtle nuances related to the paint application.\n\nIn 1960 the painting was surface cleaned and varnished with Acryloid B72 (two brush coats and a final spray coat). The 1960 examination report states that the painting was previously unvarnished.\n\nIn 1962 the painting was wax-resin lined and stretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. Black fabric tape was applied around the edges and extended a few millimeters onto the painted surface in places.\n\nIn 2013 the black fabric tape was removed from the edges of the painting. The synthetic varnish was removed, and the painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. A series of small pinholes around the edges of the composition may relate to pinning of the canvas for execution. There is general wear and abrasion around the tacking edges and foldovers that extend slightly onto the picture plane in some areas. Remnants of newsprint were observed on the tacking edges. The paint layer is in good condition. There is some flattening at the peaks of some of the thicker brushstrokes that probably relates to the lining process. There are light, horizontal-stretcher bar cracks along the top stretcher bar and original crossbar. There is one tiny flake loss and a localized area of abrasion at the sitter\u2019s proper left elbow. There are a few tiny accretions on the surface including an area at the upper left corner that looks like glue or resin residues that are dark and discolored.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1982): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an eighteenth-century French Louis XIV convex frame with foliate and floral scrolls and fleur-de-lis corner cartouches. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and carved ornament. The original gilding has been damaged and portions have overgilding. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetails. The frame has been resized with butt joints on either side of the corner cartouches and the moldings glued to a back frame. The molding from the perimeter to the interior is fillet, torus with egg-and-leaf, scotia-side, convex face with cabled foliate and floral scrolls on a quadrillage bed and corner fleur-de-lis cartouches with foliate c-scroll on a diamond ground, hollow, fillet, and ovolo with egg-and-leaf ornament at the sight (fig. 16.40). The frame\u2019s section width is 11.5 cm (4 1/2 in.).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1960; removed at an unknown date): The painting was previously housed in what appears to be a Louis XVI entablature frame (fig. 16.41).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Estate of the artist.\n\nSold at the artist\u2019s estate sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Feb. 4\u20135, 1884, lot 26, to Georges de Bellio (died 1894), Paris, for 600 francs.\n\nBy descent from Georges de Bellio, Paris, to his son-in-law, Eug\u00e8ne Donop de Monchy, Paris, from 1894 to at least 1910.\n\nAcquired by Paul Rosenberg, Paris, by 1919.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, by 1931.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932), Chicago, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Possibly Paris, \u00c9cole nationale des beaux-arts, Exposition des Oeuvres de \u00c9douard Manet, Jan. 1884, hors cat.\n\nZurich, Z\u00fcrcher Kunsthaus, Franz\u00f6sische Kunst des XIX. und XX.

As a personal friend of Meunier, known as Murer (he died in April 1906), whom we consider one of the most curious figures in the Impressionist movement, and whom no one knew more intimately than we (he left us all his papers, which are of juicy anecdotal interest), we must be permitted to state that this identification simply makes one laugh. There was indeed, in 1878 [sic], an oval portrait\u2014charming and celebrated too\u2014of Murer\u2019s sister, who later became Mme J\u00e9r\u00f4me Doucet, but it is by Renoir. . . .

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe canvas fibers were not analyzed.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Small discrepancies between the current dimensions and the standard size are likely due to restretching of the painting on a new stretcher after lining (see Conservation History).\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: \u00c9douard Manet, Portrait of a Woman with a Black Fichu (RW285/1933.436),\u201d Jan. 2014.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases came from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: \u00c9douard Manet, RW100, RW285,\u201d July 2013. The weft patterns for the two canvases, however, are very different, which may indicate that they were located far apart on the original length of fabric. There are some minor differences in the ground composition of the two paintings, and the ground of Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865\u201367 (cat. 11), was found to be substantially thicker in the samples analyzed. This could provide further evidence that the two canvases came from different rolls of primed canvas.\n\nSimilar pinholes and evidence that the works were painted before being mounted on their stretchers were observed in Manet\u2019s Fish (Still Life) (cat. 2) and Sea View, Calm Weather (Vue de mer, temps calme) (cat. 3).\n\nThe askew canvas, combined with the warp-thread match with Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865\u201367 (cat. 11), painted a decade earlier, raises the possibility that the canvas may have been a leftover piece from a length of primed canvas that Manet had purchased, cut, and stretched himself. It seems unlikely that unpainted canvas would be stretched at such an angle by a professional color merchant. However, if the work was unstretched (pinned flat) during the painting process, the rotation may have been less obvious, or simply did not concern the artist. Once the composition was established, this probably dictated how the canvas had to be mounted on the stretcher.\n\nSee drawing of the stretcher made on back of Louis Pomerantz, examination report, Aug. 18, 1960, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer could not be confirmed from cross-sectional analysis.\n\nIn the sample taken from the picture plane, the presence of two distinct layers of similar composition\u2014a thin, denser layer on top of a thicker one with higher proportions of binder and chalk\u2014was suggested, but it is uncertain whether this represents a double application, overlapping brushstrokes, or some other phenomenon.\n\nTraces of silicon, aluminum, and magnesium were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanBlackFichu\\_1933\\_436\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 30, 2014, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSince a few brown particles were observed in the ground layer microscopically and traces of iron were detected by XRF analysis, traces of iron-oxide pigments may also be present. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanBlackFichu\\_1933\\_436\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 30, 2014; Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanBlackFichu\\_1933\\_436\\_XRF\\_Report,\u201d July 23, 2013, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. Although a warp-thread match was detected with Manet\u2019s Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher), 1865\u201367 (cat. 11), there are some differences in the ground composition of the two paintings, and the ground of Beggar with a Duffle Coat was found to be substantially thicker in the samples analyzed. This could indicate that the two canvases came from different rolls of primed canvas.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, bone black (SEM/EDX, XRF); Naples yellow, cerulean blue (SEM/EDX); yellow and red iron oxides, vermilion (XRF); malachite (Raman, XRF). Traces of chromium detected by XRF could also indicate the presence of a chromium-containing pigment. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanBlackFichu\\_1933\\_436\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 30, 2014; Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_WomanBlackFichu\\_1933\\_436\\_XRF\\_Report,\u201d July 23, 2013, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is difficult to identify the specific type of lake used solely by its fluorescence under UV light because many factors can affect the perceived color of the fluorescence, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments. Some types of madder- and purpurin-lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including theirfluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination as well as knowledge of Manet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Manet paintings in other collections.
