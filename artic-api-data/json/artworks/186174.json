The members of the community also built a cooperatives garment factory; Benjamin Brown, the \u201cfather\u201d of the Jersey Homesteads, hoped that a better life for community members could be structured around work on a self-sustaining farm in the growing season, combined with winter employment in the garment factory.\n\nThis mural, created by the soon-to-be-renowned artist Ben Shahn, traces the story of the Jersey Homesteads in three panels, from the arrival of immigrants at Ellis Island, to the planning of the cooperative community, to the movement from the city to the simple but light-filled homes in the countryside. Early supporters of the community, including Albert Einstein and the painter Raphael Soyer, are also depicted. After completing the mural in 1938, Shahn and his wife Bernada decided to become residents themselves.\n\nFor a while it worked. Two hundred homes were built, exciting ideas clashed at town meetings, and other artists followed Soyer and Shahn, until the small town had a remarkable number of painters, poets, weavers and potters. But the agricultural cooperative failed as it was discovered that there were no true farmers among the urban pioneers. And the factory became a button-making facility\u2014the garment trade is always a risky business, but particularly so at the height of the Depression.\n\nJersey Homesteads was renamed \u201cRoosevelt\u201d shortly after World War II. Bit by bit, the elements of communalism disappeared, except for the ongoing Roosevelt Arts Project (RAP), begun in 1986 by Bernada Shahn and the artist Jacob Landau, among others. RAP is dedicated to bringing together artists in a variety of media, to foster collaboration and present experimental work to the public. Thus at Roosevelt, of which it was said, \u201cif there were two people in the room, there were three opinions,\u201d a measure of true community has finally been achieved\u2014just not in the fields or the town hall.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
