    "copy": " This exceptional book offers a fresh and extensive examination of the work of pioneering artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy (1895\u20131946). The first major American survey of his oeuvre in nearly a half century and the most extensive English-language book on the artist in thirty years, the catalogue presents Moholy\u2019s production across a range of art forms including painting, sculpture, photography, graphic design, film, advertising, and theater. More than 300 works are illustrated in color, including the artist\u2019s early paintings and photograms, his whimsical photomontages\u2014all of which are reproduced together here for the first time\u2014and late works in Plexiglas. Distinguished scholars share new insights into Moholy's materials and working methods; the relation among writing, administration, and art making in his practice; and his influence on contemporary art. Particular emphasis is given to Moholy's American years and his leadership of the Chicago Bauhaus as well as his reception as a painter.   Edited by Matthew S. Witkovsky, Carol S. Eliel, and Karole P. B. Vail   324 pages, 9 x 12 in. 504 color and 7 b/w ills. Hardcover $65.00 in. ISBN: 978-0-300-21479-6 ",
