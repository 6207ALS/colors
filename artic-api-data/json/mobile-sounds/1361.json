    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is a rectangular bronze cauldron, a ritual food vessel called a fang ding or ding for short.  It's from the Shang Dynasty, China's earliest known dynasty and dates to the 12th to 11th Century BC or more than 3,000 years ago.  This fact alone is extraordinary especially when we recall that Greek bronzes of comparable quality were not produced until the 5th or 6th Century BC or some 800 years later.  Notice the stout legs, massive handles and substantial body of this otherwise diminutive vessel.  There is always a boldness to Shang bronzes, a physical firmness to their full forms and a refinement to the detail decoration too with an emphasis on symmetry.  Look closely and you can see mirrored pairs of birds in profile cast in high relief atop each wall, their long trailing tails and feathers stand out from a background of squared spirals.  At the top of each leg, you can see ogre masks known as taotie, bisecting each of these masks projecting out at a diagonal are thick flanges edged with curving forms.  Vessels of this style are associated with Anyang which was the center of the Shang Dynasty in its late period.  Similar vessels have been found in tombs at Anyang and other regions of North China.  They were probably ritual objects used to hold food offerings for ancestors.  Notably, this vessel is a historical document as well as a work of art.  If you look inside the vessel you will see an inscription on the bottom, it records the name of someone's father in whose memory the vessel was dedicated.</p>\n",
