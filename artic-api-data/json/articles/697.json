    "copy": " When this striking portrait by John Singer Sargent came to Chicago for the first time in November 1922, the Art Institute\u2019s leaders had long been looking to acquire a full-length composition by the celebrated American painter. Its arrival for the museum\u2019s Thirty-Fifth Annual Exhibition of American Paintings and Sculpture coincided with its availability for purchase, and the Art Institute seized the opportunity to make such a significant addition to the permanent collection. As museum president Charles Hutchinson noted at the time, \u201cWe all think it one of Sargent\u2019s good things.\u201d   The subject of the portrait is Elizabeth \u201cElsie\u201d Swinton, a British woman who spent her childhood in Russia and married an Edinburgh-born military man and London politician. Her mother commissioned the painting in 1895, when Sargent was at the height of his fame and fashionability, intending it to be a wedding present for the couple. The piece, however, was not started until April 1896, due to Sargent\u2019s busy schedule, and was not completed until the following year, when Swinton had already been married two years and had a child. Despite the delay, Swinton recalled fondly her portrait\u2019s long production: \u201cIt took a great many sittings as we wasted a lot of time playing the piano and singing instead of getting on with the picture.\u201d Sargent kept a piano in his studio, often playing for his sitters\u2014an amusing diversion that especially appealed to Swinton, an amateur singer who would begin to sing professionally in 1906.   In the portrait that resulted from their music-filled time together, Swinton\u2014with her assertive pose, coolly reserved gaze, and decidedly elegant presence\u2014comes across as a discerning, worldly woman. While her face is modeled in fine detail, the shimmering, translucent fabric of her dress is rendered in a burst of impressionistic brushstrokes, a display of the painterly virtuosity that made Sargent one of the most sought-after artists of the late 19th century.   Since its acquisition in 1922, Mrs. George Swinton (Elizabeth Ebsworth) has become a fixture of the Art Institute\u2019s collection and a highlight of our considerable holdings of the artist\u2019s work. In the exhibition John Singer Sargent and Chicago\u2019s Gilded Age , the portrait joins nearly 100 objects that together tell a new story about the beloved portraitist and his Chicago connections. See \u201cElsie\u201d and other paintings by Sargent when John Singer Sargent and Chicago\u2019s Gilded Age opens on July 1. ",
