    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A Canadian by birth, Agnes Martin was an abstract painter who settled first in New York City and then in New Mexico. Her minimalist paintings often feature a tight compositional grid made of pencil marks and super imposed with diaphanous washes of color. Martin created \u201cUntitled Number 12\u201d in 1977.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: It\u2019s not a canvas that is easy to see or perceive right away. From a distance it might look like a pale gray monochrome with no other kind of surface inflection. And as you can come closer you can begin to make out the grid.  The pencil marks do emerge. It\u2019s an incredibly delicate surface.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The grid produces a subtle shimmering or vibrating of the surface. The pale hues seem to float off the canvas.<br>Kate Nesin:  The closer you look, you can see that here and there the graphite line shakes or trembles. It\u2019s really hand drawn and where the pencil skips over the week of the campus becomes a part of the overall effect of the painting, the imperfection of this otherwise perfect grid.</p>\n",
