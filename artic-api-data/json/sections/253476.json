The image depicts Maud Franklin (see also cat. 3, cat. 4, cat. 6, and cat. 10) lounging seductively, her legs crossed casually over the arm of a large, upholstered chair. Whistler began by drawing the composition in crayon on a coarsely grained stone, and then went back into the image, applying tusche washes with a brush to enhance volumes and shadowed areas. In the process, he partially obscured the crayon drawing below. Probably in an attempt to unify the two media, the artist then employed a large brush to float dilute tusche washes over the entire composition.\n\nWhistler clearly found it difficult to predict and control the tonalities of the tusche washes. In this work, the background and the face remained very pale, while the thick brush strokes in the dress printed too heavily. He attempted to resolve some of these tonal inequalities by scraping areas of the skirt, chair back, and background, and by lightening portions of the skirt using a roulette. Finally, he did some further drawing with the crayon on the arm of the chair and in the area surrounding the model\u2019s foot at the right. Despite these adjustments, Whistler remained dissatisfied with the image. Nevertheless, his work on this stone seems to have whetted his appetite for further experimentation in lithotint.\n\nT. R. Way did not include the print in his first catalogue (1896); it only appeared in the second edition (1905). There, he grouped it with other lithographs that had been \u201ccondemned by their author after very few prints had been pulled, and were not thought of sufficient importance by him to be included in the first edition.\u201d All known impressions of this image are printed on the \u201cgood ordinary white paper\u201d that the Ways commonly used for trial proofs.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove proofing paper (288 \u00d7 224 mm); MWC, grayish ivory wove proofing paper (287 \u00d7 222 mm); Palmer, ivory wove proofing paper (293 \u00d7 224 mm).
