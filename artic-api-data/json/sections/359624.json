Always intrigued by nocturnal illumination and the effects of firelight, the artist also made transfer drawings recording the fiery furnaces of a Lyme Regis blacksmith shop (cat. 123, cat. 125, cat. 127, cat. 128, cat. 129, and cat. 130) and the glowing booths of the Onion Market at night (cat. 135). In the present image, he suggested the blinding effect of the blazing bonfire by leaving the left portion and immediate foreground of the drawing almost entirely blank.\n\nFifth of November was probably Whistler\u2019s first experiment with a new transfer paper sent by T. R. Way from London at the beginning of October. Way, who had been trying out the paper for his own lithographic work, described the new material as \u201canother white transfer paper which has a grained stone texture,\u201d and added, \u201ccertainly it is quite free from the mechanical texture of the German paper\u201d (letter 144). The printer had been urging Whistler to try it as an alternative to the thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that the artist had brought with him to Lyme Regis from Paris. Whistler finally took Way\u2019s advice in November, drawing Fifth of November and Sunday, Lyme Regis (cat. 134) on the new paper. These two images were transferred to stone and proved on 19 November 1895 (app. II.4).\n\nWhen Whistler drew Fifth of November, the transfer paper must have been creased. As a result, two intrusive diagonal lines disturb the image at upper right. When he sent the first proofs back to Lyme Regis on November 19, T. R. Way wrote: \u201cThe bonfire is I fear spoilt by the creases in the corner\u201d (letter 159). However, the artist declared himself untroubled by the defects, writing to Way that \u201cthe creases in the paper don\u2019t matter a bit\u201d (letter 162A). At the end of November he mailed signed impressions of the lithograph to the Fine Art Society for inclusion in their 1895\u201396 exhibition of his lithographs (app. I.1).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream wove Japanese vellum (312 \u00d7 231 mm), signed; SC, cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 220 mm).

He was apprehended in a cellar beneath the House of Lords on the night of 4\u20135 November 1605 and was hanged with his accomplices. November 5 is traditionally celebrated throughout Britain; fireworks and bonfires commemorate the discovery of the plot.\n\nIn his memoir of 1912, T. R. Way mistakenly identified The Master Smith (cat. 120) as one of two Lyme Regis drawings made on the new white transfer paper. This cannot be true because the portrait was completed before Way had mailed the new paper from London. Moreover, Fifth of November and Sunday, Lyme Regis were clearly drawn on the same paper, and they reveal a texture entirely different from the drawings made on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. See letter 156, esp. n. 29.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 133, only state. The Art Institute of Chicago, bequest of Bryan Lathrop, 1917.626.\n\n</section>",
