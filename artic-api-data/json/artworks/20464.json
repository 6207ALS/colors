    "description": "<p>An avid nature photographer, Eliot Porter helped to pioneer technologies of color printing and fought to have color photography recognized as art. He trained as a biochemical researcher, but quit his medical career to pursue photography full\u2013time in the 1940s, publishing numerous books and portfolios in partnership with the Sierra Club. For Porter birds embodied the very best of nature\u2019s promise, especially for a photographer. \u201cThe camera is an instrument for immediate results, \u201d he wrote, \u201cand by focusing my attention on the subject it offers a way of sublimating the indefinable longing that is aroused in me by close association with birds.\u201d In 1979 the Metropolitan Museum of Art devoted an exhibition, Intimate Landscapes, to Porter\u2019s work\u2014the museum\u2019s first solo show devoted to color photography.</p>\n",
