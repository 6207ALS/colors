R. Way stated clearly in 1896 that this lithograph was not a portrait of the French actress Sarah Bernhardt, yet confusion surrounding the sitter\u2019s identity has persisted (see Levy (1975)). The subject, as in the other figure studies of 1878 (cat. 3, cat. 5, cat. 6, and cat. 10), is in fact Maud Franklin, Whistler\u2019s mistress and frequent model during this period.\n\nWhistler drew this light-filled image on one of the stones Thomas Way sent to his Lindsey Row studio in 1878. Using at least two different crayons\u2014one soft and greasy, and another of medium hardness sharpened to a fine point\u2014he employed rapid, rhythmical strokes to suggest the intricate flounces of the model\u2019s tiered skirt. The head and shoulders are handled with extreme delicacy, giving the sitter a soft, luminous presence. After completing the drawing, the artist used a scraper to create highlights on the top of Franklin\u2019s head, on her right wrist and forearm, and in the darkest areas of her ruffled skirt. In this early experiment, Whistler\u2019s assurance and control in handling the lithographic crayon are already evident.\n\nChicago: AIC, black ink on tan wove paper (299 \u00d7 216 mm); MWC, black ink on cream chine (Japanese paper, 280 \u00d7 220 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (358 \u00d7 262 mm); Palmer, brown ink on cream wove paper (361 \u00d7 267 mm). Glasgow: HAG (2), black ink on cream wove proofing paper (279 \u00d7 210 mm); black ink on cream Japanese paper (280 \u00d7 210 mm) laid down on cream card (284 \u00d7 213 mm, a modern mount). The impression on Japanese paper has an overall gray surface tone that minimizes the contrast between image and ground. London: BM, black ink on ivory Japanese paper (377 \u00d7 271 mm). Washington: FGA, black ink on ivory chine (Japanese paper, 279 \u00d7 210 mm) mounted on white wove plate paper (380 \u00d7 311 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Cincinnati, CAM; and Cleveland, CMA.  \nNesta R.
