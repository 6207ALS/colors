    "description": "Welcome! This Web site describes a year of exciting programming at the Art Institute of Chicago about the Silk Road, an ancient network of trade routes that extended across Asia, linking powerful civilizations such as Rome and China. The Silk Road is also a metaphor for cultural exchange among people of diverse societies, distant places, and different religions. During the Silk Road Chicago celebration in 2006\u201307, the Art Institute hosted a series of special exhibitions, performances, and student and teacher programs celebrating the art and music of the Silk Road.",
