The tall hill upon which the sanctuary sits is named Short Mountain.\n\nAbout sixteen permanent residents live there, off the grid, with drinking water from a mountain spring and bathhouse water from a cistern. Solar panels produce a limited amount of electricity. The community grows much of its own food, and goats supply milk. The faeries\u2019 deeply sacrosanct and wildly celebratory sense of the earth particularly manifests itself at their May Day gathering, which they refer to as \u201cBeltane\u201d (a tradition of the Druids). The festival can last ten days and draw five hundred guests of all genders and orientations.\n\nShort Mountain Sanctuary got its start in 1981 when Milo, the sole remaining member of the Tick Creek Community, announced a need for new members at the Southeast USA Conference of Lesbians and Gay Men. The sanctuary became the first and longest-running Radical Faerie commune in America. A dozen others exist throughout the country, and more can be found in Canada, Europe and Australia.\n\nThe Radical Faeries were formed in response to what Harry Hay viewed as an increasing tendency toward heteroconformity in the homosexual community. The choice of the word \u201cfaerie\u201d reclaims a term used to denigrate gay and transgender men; \u201cradical\u201d infers an emphasis on radical politics. As a non-hierarchical organization, the Radical Faeries have no leader and no set definition of what it means to be one. Of the group, the late Bradley Rose wrote, \u201cThere are visions we share and celebrate\u2026a belief in the sacredness of nature and the earth; honoring the interconnectedness of spirit, sex, politics and culture; understanding that each one of us has our own path (paths)...\u201d\n\nSince its inception, three new gay-oriented intentional communities have formed nearby\u2014Ida, Sun Valley and Pumpkin Hollow. In the Communities Directory, Short Mountain states its policy: \u201cWe are a sanctuary and welcome visitors anytime.\u201d\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
