    "description": "<p>A palpable energy and sense of movement enliven <em>Nightlife</em>, Archibald Motley\u2019s portrayal of a crowded cabaret in the South Side neighborhood of Bronzeville in Chicago. With stylized figures, an array of diagonal lines, and heightened colors keyed to shades of magenta and violet, the artist captured the exuberance of city dwellers out on the town. Motley created a network of gestures and glances among the people, drawing attention to the various social interactions that animate the scene.</p>\n<p>The composition is an exploration of artificial lighting. Motley was inspired, in part, to paint <em>Nightlife</em> after having seen Edward Hopper\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks\"><em>Nighthawks</em></a> (1942.51), which had entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection the prior year.</p>\n",
