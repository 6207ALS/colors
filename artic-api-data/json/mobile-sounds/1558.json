    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN:  This is an incredibly rare and important early panel painting in our collection, because it was painted in what's known as the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, which was the Crusader Kingdom that Europeans held in Palestine from 1099 to roughly 1291.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The painting is a portable altar piece whose hinges allowed it to be closed for travel. Its owner, dressed in red, appears at the painting's left edge praying to the Virgin Mary, who holds the infant Christ. The right panel depicts Christ's crucifixion. Christ's crucified body with it heavy white highlights is influenced by contemporary Italian painting. But the enthroned Virgin and Child are shown in a majestic frontal pose typical of the Eastern Christian or Byzantine style. Meanwhile, the figures' haloes are made with the raised pattern technique seen in other artwork from the City of Accra, today, Akko Israel, then the capital of the Latin Kingdom.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN: And Accra was itself a very cosmopolitan town. Not only were there people native to Palestine, both Muslims and Eastern Christians, but also people who came as part of the Crusade and also pilgrims from Europe. So they were English, they were French, they were Italians, they were Germans. Just this great polyglot mix of people, of religious practice, and also of artistic styles, which is really beautifully encapsulated in this portable diptych.</p>\n",
