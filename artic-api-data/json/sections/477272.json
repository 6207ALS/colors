Hutchinson, 1924.979\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">During his annual trips to Europe, Charles L. Hutchinson, the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s first and longest-serving president, regularly visited commercial galleries and dealers, always on the lookout for artworks (fig. 9.1). As one of the nascent museum\u2019s most generous benefactors, he at times purchased pieces for its collection and either provided or raised funds for other acquisitions. While in Rome in April 1898 he stopped by the Palazzo Odescalchi to see the artist and antiquarian Attilio Simonetti; it was there that he bought this fragment of a portrait of Antinous, which, unusually, he kept for himself in his Prairie Avenue home for nearly twenty-five years.\n\nIn December 1913 Art Institute curator Frank B. Tarbell published an article about the portrait in Art in America. The accompanying photograph depicts the youth\u2019s head in right profile against a marble plaque with an irregular left edge (fig. 9.2). Its nose and neck are discolored restorations. Whereas Simonetti described the sculpture as a relief on the sales receipt (fig. 9.3), Tarbell insisted it was a fragment from a statue or bust carved in the round, identifying the plaster restorations that camouflaged its true form. He also explained that typologically the piece belonged to a group of portraits distinguished by a common hairstyle. In time he was shown to be right on both counts. Nevertheless, the portrait masqueraded as a relief when it was lent to the museum in 1922 and did so five or so years later, when it was photographed for the Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago following its donation by Hutchinson\u2019s widow.\n\nThe restorations were gone by the early 1960s, however, as photographs of the portrait from this period show (fig. 9.4, fig. 9.5, and fig. 9.6). They show the extent, degree of preservation, and general condition of the ancient fragment. It is broken along a diagonal line extending from Antinous\u2019s left jaw through the cheek, past the outer edge of the eye socket, and into the curls above the missing left ear. Its nose and neck are also gone, but most of the hair on the top, back, and right side of the head is preserved.\n\nAlthough Simonetti\u2019s claim that the Chicago portrait came from a relief was wrong\u2014perhaps deceptively so\u2014his identification of the subject was correct. Without a doubt, the person portrayed is Antinous (c. A.D. 111\u201330), the comely young companion of Emperor Hadrian (r. A.D. 117\u201338), who drowned in the Nile River during an imperial tour of Egypt. In his grief Hadrian founded the city of Antinoupolis near the site of the youth\u2019s death, elevated his status from human to divine, and mandated religious rites in his honor. But in creating hundreds, if not thousands, of portraits of Antinous, people all across the empire unwittingly ensured his immortality. In fact, so many of these images were rendered in paint, struck on coins, carved from stone, and cast in bronze that today Antinous is one of the most instantly recognizable individuals from antiquity.\n\nCurrently about one hundred sculpted statues, busts, reliefs, and disembodied portraits of Antinous from across the Roman Empire survive in varying states of preservation. The classicizing versions of full-length statues and portrait busts depict the sensual young Bithynian in the prime of his youth, with an unusually broad chest. This example, like others of its type, shows Antinous with an oval face; smooth complexion; striated brows above unarticulated, deep-set eyes with thick lower lids; an aquiline nose (although here missing); and full lips. However, the most important feature of Antinous\u2019s main portrait type is the hairstyle, and as Tarbell so perceptively recognized a century ago from the arrangement of Antinous\u2019s hair, the Art Institute\u2019s fragment came from a portrait bust of this main type. The thick curls cascading from the crown of the head over the ears and down the neck are uniformly arranged according to a fixed scheme, and the locks directly above his left eye are positioned in one of two known variations of his primary hairstyle.\n\nIndeed, an over-life-size but faceless bust was restored with a portrait of Antinous solely on the basis of a few remaining locks of its ancient hairstyle. Currently this intriguing sculpture is displayed in the Museo Nazionale Romano, Palazzo Altemps in Rome (fig. 9.7, fig. 9.8, fig. 9.9, and fig. 9.10). Antinous\u2019s pose is familiar: he gazes down, his head turned in the direction of his raised left shoulder. In addition to the surviving locks of hair on the back and left side of the head, other ancient parts of the sculpture include the neck and upper body, the latter once broken, its left edge now restored. Presumably the socle and the new face were added at the same time. While examining the Altemps bust, Egyptologist W. Raymond Johnson noticed that the angle of the join of the restored face was similar to the break on the Chicago portrait, and he brought his observation to the attention of the Art Institute.\n\nAt the suggestion of the J. Paul Getty Museum\u2019s senior conservator of antiquities, Jerry Podany, a cast of the Chicago portrait was made for comparison with the Altemps bust, which Podany subsequently organized with the Roman museum\u2019s director, Alessandra Capodiferro. Placed side by side, the two pieces were remarkably similar in scale and general appearance (fig. 9.11). Thereafter three-dimensional measurements of the surviving ancient bust and cast were taken, and the early modern head was digitally removed along the presumed line of the join and replaced with an image of the Chicago portrait (fig. 9.12). Despite losses to the left jaw, the two pieces appeared to belong together. A three-dimensional one-third-scale model was made of both parts of the ancient head. Once aligned, the gap between the head and the face was filled with modeling clay (fig. 9.13 and fig. 9.14), and the lost sections of hair were carved using Christoph Clairmont\u2019s diagram of Antinous\u2019s curls as a guide (fig. 9.15 and fig. 9.16). Three-dimensional measurements were then taken of the new model, and the complete head was printed with the areas of loss clearly indicated (fig. 9.17, fig. 9.18, and fig. 9.19). A full-scale model of the bust incorporating the Chicago portrait was cast in plaster to re-create the appearance of the original second-century bust (fig. 9.20).\n\nAlso on Podany\u2019s advice, samples of stone were extracted from the Chicago portrait and the Altemps bust for isotopic and petrographic analysis. Tests performed by the Laboratorio di Analisi dei Materiali Antichi in Venice, Italy, revealed that both pieces were carved from Carrara marble and are sufficiently similar that they could have come from the same block of stone. Based on the reconstructed model of the sculpture and the scientific assessment of its stone, it is all but certain that the Chicago fragment was once the face of the Altemps bust. Although it has taken a decade to test Johnson\u2019s hypothesis, preparations are under way at this writing for an exhibition devoted to his important discovery.\n\nThe association of the Chicago portrait with the Altemps bust opened new avenues of exploration about the sculpture\u2019s past. The latter once belonged to the Boncompagni Ludovisi family, keepers of perhaps the most prestigious collection of ancient sculptures in Rome. Begun in the early seventeenth century by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, it comprised purchases, gifts, and discoveries unearthed during the construction of his immense estate between the Pincian and Salarian Gates along the northwestern perimeter of the city. In antiquity this land belonged to the statesman and historian Sallust; either he or his son transformed it into a luxurious country retreat. In the following century these gardens passed into the hands of Emperor Tiberius and became a beautiful public park embellished with scores of fine sculptures, some of which ultimately formed the core of the Ludovisi collection.\n\nThe marriage in 1681 of Gregorio II Boncompagni, Duke of Sora, and Ippolita Ludovisi, Princess of Piombino, consolidated the resources of these two immensely wealthy clans, and the Boncompagni Ludovisi dynasty prospered for the next two centuries. However, in the decades following 1870, when Rome became the capital of Italy, the family\u2019s fortunes took a turn for the worse; their celebrated estate was dismantled, and their land was sold off to become an elite residential quarter. In 1901 the Italian government purchased 104 sculptures from the Ludovisi collection. Included among these pieces, which were relocated to the Baths of Diocletian, was the bust of Antinous.\n\nSince 1997 the bust has been displayed with other Boncompagni Ludovisi treasures in the renovated Palazzo Altemps. In her 2011 catalog of the museum\u2019s sculpture holdings, Matilde De Angelis d\u2019Ossat wrote that it is known to have been in the Boncompagni Ludovisi collection only as far back as 1794, presumably on the basis of its appearance in an edition of Giuseppe Vasi\u2019s guidebook of the same year. However, Vasi\u2019s earlier 1786 French edition of this guide likewise lists this piece, while Pietro Rossini\u2019s book of 1693 also appears to refer to it. Rossini lists the subject as \u201cAntino,\u201d which may be an early modern spelling, a scribe\u2019s error, or an indication that he was unfamiliar with Antinous. Rossini\u2019s and Vasi\u2019s references are scant and imprecise, but together they strongly suggest that a bust of Antinous, arguably the Altemps piece, was in the family\u2019s possession as early as the late seventeenth century.\n\nPossibly the most compelling evidence for believing that the sculpture described by Rossini and Vasi is the Altemps bust, however, is provided by no less an authority than Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Following his 1756 examination of the bust of Antinous at the Villa Ludovisi, he recorded two comments (fig. 9.21). The first emphatically asserts that the statue and the back of its head are old but the (rest of the) head is new, while the second states that the head appears to be new. In light of this description, there can be little doubt that he saw the Altemps bust in its present form. Despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014its restored face, the piece continued to be considered noteworthy and to be commented upon, both by editors of Winckelmann\u2019s collected works and also more broadly. The earliest known photograph of the curious hybrid was taken around 1890 (fig. 9.22).\n\nThere is no mention in the literature reviewed so far of documents pertaining to the Ludovisi family\u2019s acquisition of a bust of Antinous, but inventories of estate holdings made between the seventeenth and the late nineteenth centuries reference what is surely the Altemps piece. In fact, when examining a transcription of the 1641 inventory, Elizabeth Hahn Benge noticed a sculpture described as a larger-than-life-size head and chest of \u201cAntonio\u201d located in the Palazzo Grande and wondered it if might refer to the Altemps bust. Benge also observed that Rossini\u2019s and Vasi\u2019s accounts supported her contention, since the busts they mentioned were displayed in the first room of the palace; because the collections were relatively immobile, the tour books repeat the same order. Another reason to think that the sculpture cited in the 1641 inventory is the Altemps piece is the absence of any additional busts of Antinous\u2014misspellings aside\u2014in the inventories of and guides to the Villa Ludovisi. Further, like the recorder of the 1641 inventory, later authors noted the sculpture\u2019s heroic rather than human scale.\n\nIf, as seems likely, Benge is right, one wonders whether Ludovico Ludovisi purchased the bust or otherwise obtained it from an earlier collection. Alas, the surviving records contain only vague descriptions. For example, the list of 120 artworks acquired from the famed Cesi collection only notes \u201ctwenty statues with five torsos and fifty minor fragments of statues, fifty-one heads and busts, thirty reliefs,\u201d and so on. The inventory made at the time of the cardinal\u2019s death is equally imprecise.\n\nIf not acquired by purchase or gift, was the bust found in fragments on the grounds of the estate during construction? It is tempting to wonder if the sculpture was knocked over by the Visigothic troops of Alaric I when they entered Rome through the Salarian Gate and sacked the city in A.D. 410, leaving its parts to lie scattered around the imperial gardens for centuries until they were recovered and reassembled. Had that been the case, however, the Chicago portrait would surely have been reattached to the Altemps bust then, too. Or was the head buried in the vicinity of the other fragments but missed by the excavators? Had it been discovered earlier and carted off elsewhere? Answers to these questions may never be known, but it should be noted here that most portraits of Antinous discovered in Rome and its environs were found in private rather than public settings.\n\nAlso unknown, at least for the time being, is when the ancient fragments of the Altemps bust were reassembled and who carved its early modern face. Despite considerable liberties taken with the arrangement of the locks above the youth\u2019s forehead, it seems that the restorer was familiar with the pose, facial features, and disposition of other portraits of Antinous. Caroline Vout alluded to a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century date for the face, and Hugo Meyer suggested that Ippolito Buzzi, one of several restorers employed by Cardinal Ludovisi, may have created it. It is worth recalling that when Winckelmann saw the bust in 1756, well over a century after Buzzi\u2019s death, he observed that the head was new. But in describing the face thus, was he simply remarking that it was not original to the ancient sculpture, or was he implying that it had been made in very recent times? This is another question without an answer.\n\nAlthough an early modern history for the Altemps bust can be constructed with some confidence, all attempts to track a trajectory for the Chicago portrait have been unsuccessful. More than a century after Hutchinson purchased the head from Simonetti, the business is still in his family\u2019s hands, although it now sells Asian rather than ancient art and operates under a different name on Rome\u2019s prestigious Via Margutta. A search of its records, which are substantially incomplete, turned up a client book containing Hutchinson\u2019s name and address. However, there were no documents indicating how the dealer came to have the portrait or who converted it from a fragment of sculpture in the round to a faux relief by attaching it to a plaque, restoring the nose and neck, and covering the losses with plaster.\n\nMeanwhile, scientific analysis revealed that surface deposits on the back of the Chicago portrait \u201cappear to be from a preindustrial cement such as the Romans used,\u201d suggesting the likelihood that the Chicago portrait was separated from the Altemps bust in antiquity and lay in the earth near an ancient construction site. Since Hutchinson purchased the piece in Rome, there is good reason to think that it remained in the city from the time the original sculpture was fashioned in the mid-second century until he shipped the portrait to Chicago in 1898.\n\nIn America, the piece has led an adventurous life. On January 24, 1983, Kitty Hannaford, a research assistant for classical art at the Art Institute of Chicago, spoke twice by telephone with an unidentified male caller who reported that he knew the location of the museum\u2019s \u201cportrait of young man whose name began with A who accompanied the Roman emperor to Egypt,\u201d which he also said \u201chad been stolen by a night watchman\u201d in the early 1960s, and he wanted to know if there was a reward for its return. Recalling a registration card for a portrait of Antinous, Hannaford found the department\u2019s object file and discovered that next to the label \u201cAntinous 1924.979\u201d was a handwritten note reading, \u201cSculpture\u2014where?\u201d As there were no galleries of ancient art at the time, Hannaford searched the storage area the following morning. Unable to locate the portrait, she then took the issue to museum registrar Wallace Bradway, whose files also indicated that the whereabouts of the piece were unknown. A similar notation, \u201cwhere,\u201d in the hand of Bradway\u2019s predecessor, who left in 1965, clearly indicates that the portrait\u2019s disappearance was noted by the mid-1960s at the latest. Hannaford handed the matter over to Louise Berge, the Art Institute\u2019s associate curator of classical art. She made contact with the mysterious caller, who subsequently identified himself as Jim Moran. He informed her that the portrait of Antinous was with Henry Geldzahler in New York.\n\nA highly influential personality on the American art scene from 1960 until his death in 1994, Geldzahler (fig. 9.23) was by 1983 a renowned art historian, critic, and public official who had become the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s first curator of contemporary arts by 1967. He was also the first director of the visual arts program at the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. commissioner for art at the Venice Biennale in 1966 and 1986, curator of the landmark 1969 exhibition New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940\u20131970, and commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City. Closely involved with a number of artists in the 1960s, among them David Hockney, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol, Geldzahler will forever be inextricably linked with\u2014if not partly responsible for\u2014the ascendancy of Pop Art and Color Field painting on the New York cultural scene.\n\nIn a telephone call on February 3, 1983, Geldzahler provided Berge with several salient details: the portrait was given to him in Chicago; it had been in his possession for \u201csome twenty years\u201d; he undertook research that revealed it belonged to the Art Institute; and when he informed the museum in writing of its current whereabouts, \u201cwe wrote back that it was not ours.\u201d He then consulted with Metropolitan Museum of Art director James Rorimer, and \u201cit was decided that he hang on to the piece.\u201d\n\nBerge recounted what she learned to the Art Institute\u2019s director, James N. Wood, who had worked under Geldzahler during his tenure at the Metropolitan (fig. 9.24). On February 4, 1983, Wood telephoned his former supervisor, and additional details appear in the notes he took during their conversation. Geldzahler reported that he received the piece from a Chicago artist whose \u201cfriend was a night guard at A.I.C.\u201d He brought the portrait to the attention of Dietrich von Bothmer, curator of Greek and Roman art at the Metropolitan, and Peter von Blanckenhagen, professor of classical art history at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, who discovered that it had been published in the Art Institute\u2019s annual report. Geldzahler recapped his earlier discussion with Berge, repeating that when he informed the Art Institute that he had the portrait in his possession, he was told \u201cthey had no department and it wasn\u2019t theirs.\u201d He also recalled his long-ago conversation with Rorimer, who advised him not to worry about the matter any further.\n\nGeldzahler subsequently supplied Wood with photocopies of a letter dated March 2, 1961, that he addressed to John Maxon, the Art Institute\u2019s director of fine arts, as well as three photographs of the piece. Arrangements were made for the portrait\u2019s return; Berge and Bob Combs, assistant director of protection services, were dispatched to New York to retrieve it from Geldzahler\u2019s home. While the portrait was being packed into a crate, Combs recalls, Geldzahler commented about how much he had enjoyed having the portrait over the years and how he had wondered when the Art Institute would take it back. The museum issued a receipt for its return on March 2, 1983, twenty-two years to the day after Geldzahler\u2019s letter to Maxon.\n\nDuring the course of his career, Geldzahler received a number of artworks as gifts from painters and sculptors, and he displayed the portrait of Antinous alongside various pieces. A close friend, the writer and small press publisher Raymond Foye, recalled, \u201cHenry kept the sculpture on the floor, on the carpet\u2014next to a Warhol Brillo box, a Keith Haring vase, etc.\u201d He also remembered that it attracted the attention of the artist Cy Twombly: \u201cWhen he saw the head he picked it up and stroked the cheek\u2014it was incredibly sensual.\u201d An article about Geldzahler\u2019s collection published in 1983 features an illustration showing the Chicago portrait in front of a version of Hammer and Sickle by Andy Warhol and below a painting of a swimming pool by David Hockney (fig. 9.25).\n\nIn a later letter to Geldzahler, Wood reported, \u201cAntinous now graces the corner of my office . . . and inspires a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu you would appreciate.\u201d Is this an allusion on Wood\u2019s part to the fact that he had seen the portrait while it was in Geldzahler\u2019s possession but did not know or recall that it belonged to a museum that he would direct for nearly twenty-five years?\n\nThe Fragment of a Portrait Head of Antinous is now displayed in the Mary and Michael Jaharis Galleries of Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Art alongside the museum\u2019s Portrait Head of Emperor Hadrian (fig. 9.26; see cat. 6). In declaring Antinous a god and establishing religious rites and games in his honor, Hadrian took steps to secure his young companion\u2019s immortality. Although the ancient cult of Antinous waned during the Middle Ages, he was never completely forgotten. Along with the reawakening of interest in antiquity in the early modern period came a renewed fascination with the youth that continues to this day. For example, on December 7, 2010, Lorne Thyssen-Bornemisza de K\u00e1szon bought a portrait bust of Antinous at auction for $23,800,000. More recently, a long-missing portrait bust of the youth in the guise of Osiris was purchased privately for an undisclosed amount. Furthermore, the dawn of the twenty-first century saw the emergence\u2014on the Internet\u2014of a new form of reverential worship of Antinous that glorifies the emperor\u2019s young lover as a living god. The motto of the Ecclesia Antinoi is \u201cAve Vive Antinoe,\u201d or \u201cHail, may you live Antinous!\u201d  \nKaren Manchester\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Academic research and technical investigations carried out on this object have yielded a curatorial triumph: the portrait fragment is in all likelihood the original visage from a bust of Antinous currently housed in the Museo Nazionale Romano, Palazzo Altemps in Rome (fig. 9.27 and fig. 9.8). The fragment was carved from a fine-grained, white marble that has been identified as Carrara. While no traces of original toolmarks remain, the sculpted surfaces show evidence of recutting, in addition to the combined use of acid and repolishing. No indication of polychromy or gilding has been detected. Studies of multiple samples of encrusting material on the primary break surface reveal that the fragment was likely buried in sediments containing ancient mortar debris. The object is somewhat pockmarked and abraded overall, but, given its complex history, it is in remarkably good condition. Little evidence of documented conservation treatments can be found, despite the object\u2019s long residence in the museum\u2019s collection. Recent scholarship for this publication has, however, brought renewed attention to the object\u2019s features, condition, and history. Petrographic and isotopic comparisons of the Chicago portrait fragment and the Altemps bust suggest that the two pieces could have been carved from the same parent block of stone. The bust and a cast of the portrait were laser scanned and mapped, and from these data three-dimensional models were rendered. With the assistance of a team of specialists in Rome, the two models were brought together and unified convincingly in accordance with established iconographical scholarship regarding Antinous\u2019s appearance.\n\nThe marble is an extremely dense, fine-grained variety with an overall ivory hue, free of visible veins or banding. Burial has conferred on the face a somewhat mottled, ocher appearance.\n\nPrimary mineral: calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>)\n\nAccessory minerals: graphite, C (abundant); iron oxides, specifically hematite (traces)\n\nA semicircular fragment, approximately 2.5 cm high and 1 cm wide, was removed from the proper right edge of the primary break surface, level with the midline of the object. The sample was then used to perform minero-petrographic analysis. Part of the sample was finely ground, and the resulting powder was analyzed using X-ray diffraction to determine whether dolomite is present. The remaining portion of the sample was mounted onto a glass slide and ground to a thickness of 30 \u03bcm for study under a polarizing microscope.\n\nGrain size: fine (average MGS less than 2 mm)\n\nMaximum grain size (MGS): 0.72 mm\n\nFabric: heteroblastic mosaic\n\nCalcite boundaries: curved\n\nMicroscopic examination of the prepared thin-section sample revealed strong decohesion.\n\nThin-section photomicrograph: fig. 9.28\n\nMarble type: Carrara (marmor lunense)\n\nQuarry site: Carrara region, Apuan Alps, Italy\n\nThe determination of the marble as Carrara was made on the basis of the results of both minero-petrographic analysis and isotopic analysis.\n\nIsotopic ratio diagram: fig. 9.29\n\nThe object is a fragment of a portrait bust. The fragment was carved from a single block of stone using the various hand tools and implements that would have been customary for the period, such as chisels, drills, rasps, and scrapers.\n\nThe face and much of the hair were repolished subsequent to the rediscovery of the fragment. Therefore, little in the way of ancient toolmarks remains on the surface. Indeed, it seems unlikely that the ancient surface is completely preserved anywhere.\n\nThe carving of the hair shows a pronounced trend toward simplification proceeding from the edges of the face to the crown of the head. From fully formed curls, the hair becomes progressively more shallow, and chisel marks, completely absent on the locks near the forehead, become continuous over the entire surface (fig. 9.30). Although the hair on the top of the head is cursory, the marks of two types of chisel are discernible, one flat and the other slightly curved. The retention of these marks, the freshly cleaved appearance of the marble grains, and the absence of encrusting deposits suggest that this is recutting, rather than the ancient surface. Examination under ultraviolet radiation of a section of hair on the back of the head, where the same chisel marks are also visible, reveals a semicircular area that appears a noticeably darker violet color (fig. 9.31), lending support to the theory that these toolmarks are the result of more recent recutting.\n\nWithin the curls, drill marks 2 mm in diameter are visible (fig. 9.32 and fig. 9.33).\n\nNo artist\u2019s or fabricator\u2019s marks were observed.\n\nMicroscopic examination of the stone\u2019s surfaces revealed no traces of polychromy or gilding.\n\nThe head is in reasonably good condition, its fragmentary state notwithstanding. Prominent scratches and gouges are visible on the proper right cheek and jaw. Their violet coloration under ultraviolet radiation suggests that they are relatively recent, and indeed they look very much like excavation-related damage. Minor spalls and abrasions are present throughout, in particular on the lower portion of the proper left cheek, on the proper left eyebrow, at the center of the bottom lip, on the outside edge of the ear, and at the center of the chin. All along the outer margin of the object, losses, spalls, and lacunae associated with the primary fracture are evident. Various small losses are visible on the tips of the curls framing the face, and there is a larger loss to a lock of hair on the proper right side. A significant abrasion extends horizontally across the proper right temple.\n\nThe nose was at one point fractured, and the break edge was modified from a natural break to a flat, easily matched surface and provided with texturing to secure a restoration that has since been removed. Examination of the nose under ultraviolet radiation reveals that this attachment was secured with a pin or round dowel (fig. 9.34). There are minor associated losses to the bridge of the nose.\n\nThe marble exhibits many blind, hairline cracks. The most significant of them extends through the hair downward from the crown of the head on the proper right side (fig. 9.35). Other large cracks can be seen traveling vertically in line with the break edge near the back of the head on the proper right side. Smaller cracks are also in evidence: a network of fine cracks runs horizontally along the proper right temple, a fine crack extends vertically for approximately 6 cm down the center of the proper right cheek, and another can be seen at the bottom of the earlobe. A short but deep crack is present on the chin. Most of the cracks are stained gray, but the staining is superficial and confined to the fissures (i.e., it did not travel laterally into the marble after entering along the fissures). The gray coloration is not a consequence of trace minerals naturally present in veins or localized along the cracks (as it can be in Carrara marble, in which trace dolomite along tectonic fissures is often a cause of gray patterning).\n\nThe sculpted surfaces are almost entirely free of weathering. Instead they show several forms of reworking resulting from a thorough restoration campaign. Removal of surface deposits was no doubt one of the motivating factors for this work, along with the elimination of smaller scars and abrasions that would inevitably have affected the prominent parts of the face. The hair around the face, the eyes, and the face more generally all appear to have softened contours consistent with an acid treatment. Acid often acts more rapidly on marble than on encrusting materials, however, and can accentuate disparities of the surface condition. To ameliorate this effect, physical polishing must have been employed as well. The extremely muted eyebrows are probably a result of this dual activity (fig. 9.36). In comparison, the contours of the eyelids are sharper, suggesting that some selective recutting was done to redefine certain details (fig. 9.37). Although recutting was not used to remove chips from the cheek and jaw, a small region of sculpted surface near the left eyebrow along the break edge was flattened by repolishing, probably to remove a chip there.\n\nThe difference between the condition of the hair on the top of the head and the condition of the face presents a puzzle. The freshness of the toolmarks in the hair demonstrates that acid was not employed there subsequent to the recutting (fig. 9.38). It may not have been employed there at all. Why would recutting so extensive as to leave marks on every lock of hair be undertaken on the least important and least visible part of the fragment? One possible explanation is that the restorer exercised less restraint in recarving the hair near the top of the head precisely because of the lesser importance of this area. Or it could be that, if the top of the head was weathered to the same extent as the much fuller locks near the face, it might have appeared almost featureless prior to recarving, given the low relief of the hair in this area. The use of acid and of more-careful polishing in the hair around the face may have been governed by the fact that the high relief and undercuts in that area left little room for recutting to be done without adversely affecting the hair\u2019s form and volume, coupled with the restorer\u2019s desire that it not be so evidently reworked as the top of the head.\n\nA series of small pits can be seen in some of the low-relief areas of the un-recut hair framing the face. These are typical of lichen colonization on marble, sometimes associated with lichen apothecia (fig. 9.39). Traces of oxalates were also detected in these un-recut areas, which in this instance could support a history of biological growth on the surface of the object, although it could equally indicate the use of oxalic acid in its cleaning.\n\nVarious accretions and superficial stains are distributed uniformly across the sculpted surface of the object.\n\nThe primary break surface bears enough remaining residues to give confidence that this was approximately the surface as found. However, the break has been worked in a fashion typical of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to simplify the joining of the fragment to another mass of stone or to the plaque onto which it had been mounted by the end of the nineteenth century (see Curatorial Entry, para. 3). The periphery of the break was smoothed down to allow greater ease in matching it to a new opposing piece, or, it could be argued, to allow space for the introduction of an adhesive in order to rejoin the fragment with the opposing break surface without displacing the fragment forward. The surface was also keyed with a chisel to provide tooth for an adhesive (fig. 9.40). Plaster remains embedded in some of the deeper sections of the keying (fig. 9.41), no doubt related to the attachment of the fragment to the plaque.\n\nThree samples were taken of residues that remain on both the carved and the broken surfaces in an attempt to learn more about the object\u2019s past environmental exposures\u2014including burial\u2014and treatment. The largest fragments of the collected material were prepared as cross sections; the remainder were analyzed as fracture fragments, without further preparation, in order to perform tests intended to relate their compositions to the complicated mixture of ingredients that they contain. The results showed that all three examples are deposits containing mineral grains bound in a dense, nonporous matrix of calcite. In addition, some of the grains within these deposits appear to be fired siliceous matter of the types used for preindustrial, partially hydraulic mortars, as were employed by the ancient Romans for construction. Their presence on the head suggests that, after it was separated from the bust, it was buried in sediments containing detritus from building. That detritus appears to have contained preindustrial mortar but did not include modern portland cement, for which different, highly specific microstructures would be expected. The possibility cannot be excluded that the head itself was used as fill material for construction.\n\nThe recrystallization of the calcite matrix is so thorough that it is not possible to tell whether these presumed mortar residues arrived on the surface in a freshly prepared state, to become attached as the mortar hardened, or whether they became bound there after a long period of intimate contact in burial, during which recrystallization of the previously formed calcite resulted in their attachment.\n\nAt some point in time, three holes were drilled into the break surface of the fragment, possibly in order to mount it to the plaque to which it was affixed when it entered the museum\u2019s collection. By the early 1960s the plaque had been removed. In 1983 segments of threaded rod were inserted into these holes and secured in place with lead, in order to attach a new mount.\n\nThe first recorded treatment of the object took place in 1993, with the goal of improving its overall appearance in preparation for exhibition. The stone was first cleaned by the application of high-pressure steam. The drill hole associated with the previous repair to the nose was filled with a proprietary filler toned with acrylic emulsion paints. The repair to the nose was further refined with powder pigments where necessary.\n\nIn 2007, following an examination that necessitated removal of the fragment\u2019s mount, minor adjustments were made to the lead fittings.\n\nIn 2013 a resin cast of the object was made. In preparation for making the mold from which the facsimile was cast, the entire surface of the marble was liberally coated with a dilute acrylic resin. Upon completion of the project, the resin was removed by solvent means.\n\nThe precise circumstances by which the Chicago fragment and the Altemps bust might have been separated from one another are a mystery. The portrait fragment displays no clear evidence of a purposeful blow or imposed fracture leading to the break. The Altemps bust is itself fragmentary, with major breaks through both shoulders and across the neck. Lesser fragments are present in association with these breaks. The face and the socle are restorations. The degree of fragmentation raises the possibility that, in their original burial context, the pieces of the sculpture were dispersed so widely as to escape full recovery. Or perhaps the original find site was compromised, and some of the fragments were transferred to a different archaeological stratum. The precise reasons why the entire sculpture was not recovered simultaneously will likely never be known. Important information could be gleaned from an examination of the break surface of the head of the Altemps bust to determine more about the correspondence of the surfaces and the potential causes of the separation of the Chicago fragment, and from an analysis of any residues on that surface to discover whether the same burial deposits are present. Regrettably, such lines of inquiry are prohibited by the attachment of the restored head to the bust.\n\nAs an initial step in trying to discern whether the Chicago fragment originally belonged to the Altemps bust, a resin cast of the fragment was made. Vital to the investigation was the precise reproduction of its perimeter and its break surface. The cast was taken to Rome for visual comparison with the bust, in the course of which many similarities in the overall appearance of the two objects, in addition to the scale and the angle of the break edges, became immediately apparent.\n\nOn the basis of the visual similarities between the cast of the Chicago fragment and the Altemps bust, a more systematic study of the two objects was undertaken. To that end, a second sample, a large triangular fragment approximately 1.8 cm high and 1.3 cm wide, was removed from the bottom proper right quadrant of the break surface of the portrait fragment. The sample was used to perform minero-petrographic analysis, in accordance with the procedure outlined above (see para. 32, note 65).\n\nPrimary mineral: calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>)\n\nAccessory minerals: graphite, C (abundant)\n\nGrain size: fine (average MGS less than 2 mm)\n\nMaximum grain size (MGS): 0.96 mm\n\nFabric: almost homeoblastic mosaic\n\nCalcite boundaries: curved\n\nThin-section photomicrograph: fig. 9.42\n\nAn ovoid fragment 2.5 cm high and 0.8 cm wide was removed from the verso of the Altemps bust, from the proper left edge of the pillar, approximately 8 cm up from the bottom edge of the top molding of the socle. This sample was also used to perform minero-petrographic analysis as described above.\n\nPrimary mineral: calcite (calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>)\n\nAccessory minerals: graphite, C (abundant)\n\nGrain size: fine (average MGS less than 2 mm)\n\nMaximum grain size (MGS): 0.95 mm\n\nFabric: almost homeoblastic mosaic, slightly lineated\n\nCalcite boundaries: curved\n\nThin-section photomicrograph: fig. 9.43\n\nIsotopic analysis was also carried out on the two samples in accordance with the procedure laid out above (see para. 41, note 69). Both samples were determined to be Carrara marble, and the results of both the minero-petrographic and the isotopic analyses were sufficiently similar that the two pieces could have come from the same block of marble.\n\nIsotopic ratio diagram: fig. 9.44\n\nIsotopic ratio diagram: fig. 9.45\n\nTo further test the theory, it was decided that an altogether new head would be created, composed of the Art Institute fragment and the Altemps bust. First, complete laser scans were made of both the bust and the resin cast of the fragment. For the method of laser scanning that was used, reflective, high-contrast targets are placed at various points on the surface of the object to be scanned (see fig. 9.46). The points are chosen to give the best representation of the object in three dimensions. The scanner emits monochromatic laser light that reflects off the targets and returns to the scanner. The scanning software processes the time it takes for the light to cycle to and from each point in order to define the distance of each point from the laser. The points are then recorded relative to the x, y, and z axes. At the same time, the scanner records the intensity of reflectivity of each target, whose angle relative to the direction of the light provides more information about the contours of the object. From this very dense cloud of data, a three-dimensional model of the object can be created with the assistance of specialized modeling software and a 3-D printer.\n\nOnce the cast of the fragment and the bust had been scanned, the restored face of the Altemps bust was digitally removed from the computer model along the presumed break line. Physical models of both the Chicago fragment and the original portion of the Altemps head were then printed at a 1:3 scale. Modeling clay was used to tack the two models together to permit evaluation and refinement of the positioning of the parts (fig. 9.13). Once their alignment was agreed upon, a void remained between the two parts, with the widest part of the gap occurring along the proper left jawline. This gap was filled with modeling clay, and the missing curls were sculpted in accordance with the existing hair and with reference to a treatise on Antinous\u2019s portrait types (see fig. 9.16). Following feedback and suggestions from both institutions, minor corrections were made, and this finished, fully modeled copy was in turn scanned to produce a new model, also at a 1:3 scale.\n\nIn order to print a 1:1 model, whose dimensions could not be accommodated by the 3-D printer, the computer model of the fully integrated bust was digitally separated into fifteen parts, which were printed individually (see fig. 9.47). The printed parts were assembled on a specially designed support that allowed for very precise alignment. Once the parts were aligned, the seams were filled and the surface was refined and finished. A mold was made from this model, and a final model will be cast in plaster.  \nRachel C.

Most notable among these studies are Clairmont, Die Bildnisse des Antinous; Meyer, Antinoos: die arch\u00e4logischen Denkm\u00e4ler; Vout, \u201cAntinous, Archaeology and History\u201d; Vout, Antinous: The Face of the Antique; Vout, \u201cWinckelmann and Antinous\u201d; and Vout, Power and Eroticism. While this fragment expands the corpus of known portraits, it adds nothing substantive to the larger conversation about the iconography, date, cult function, and display of portraits of Antinous; Vout, Power and Eroticism, pp. 52\u2013135. Further, as documented in the technical report, this fragment has been extensively reworked and overcleaned so that little, if any, of its original surface survives (see Evidence of Construction/Fabrication and Condition Summary). That aside, there is something to be said about its post-Renaissance history, and this warrants a different approach here. For the sake of clearly distinguishing the two separate parts of a single sculpture discussed herein, the restored bust in Rome is referred to as the Altemps bust, and the fragment in the Art Institute\u2019s collection is identified as the Chicago portrait.

Neither Hadrian nor Antinous left behind written records that detail the precise nature of their relationship, but classical writers and later interpreters use language that implies that it was sexual in nature.

I am grateful to Jeffrey Nigro for his review of the ancient sources.\n\nThe Antinoupolis Foundation (antinoupolis.net) was established in 2011 to excavate and preserve what little remains of the ancient city.

The Art Institute has two poorly preserved bronze coins\u2014perhaps hemidrachms and possibly minted around A.D. 134/35 in Alexandria\u2014commemorating the youth (1978.660 and 1978.661). On the obverse of each is a barely discernible portrait of the youth facing right; on the reverse is what may be Antinous in the guise of Hermes on horseback, carrying a caduceus. Examples of other Antinous coins and medallions in American collections include, at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, a medallion (1972.16) from the reign of Hadrian that was issued in Antinous\u2019s home province of Bithynia in northwest Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey) and a mirror (1982.283) formed from two imperial coins honoring Antinous. The coins that compose the mirror are broadly dated to the reign of Hadrian. On the obverse of one, issued in Arcadia, Greece, is an undraped bust of Antinous facing left. The collection of the American Numismatic Society contains a medallion (1950.89.1), originating from Mantineia, Greece, and similarly dated to Hadrian\u2019s reign, that also depicts an undraped bust of the youth facing left. This collection also has a bronze coin (1967.152.356; no denomination given) that depicts a bust of Antinous facing right, also minted in Mantineia and perhaps misdated to A.D. 130\u2014the year of Antinous\u2019s death. Indeed, as Antinous died in late A.D. 130, it is likely that all three of these objects were made no earlier than A.D. 131.

Raymond Johnson to Mary Greuel, June 25, 2005, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Johnson\u2019s hypothesis that the Art Institute\u2019s portrait might once have been attached to the Altemps bust complemented Tarbell\u2019s observation that the Chicago fragment was from a sculpture in the round. I informed Caroline Vout about Johnson\u2019s discovery during a visit to Cambridge in December 2013. I am grateful to Shawn Donnelley for putting me in touch with Vout, who, as noted elsewhere in this entry, has written about and displayed the Altemps bust.\n\nThe centuries-long attachment of the early modern head to the bust precludes its removal to test whether or not the inner surfaces of the two pieces fit together. Gratitude is extended to the Community Associates Research and Lecture Series, which in 2012 sponsored Podany\u2019s study of ancient sculptures, including this fragmentary portrait of Antinous, in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.\n\nI thank Monica Cola and Roberto Bonavenia of Studio MCM, srl, for their work on the creation of the three-dimensional scans and prints.\n\nClairmont, \u201cDie Bildnisse des Antinous,\u201d pl. 38.\n\nSee Petrographic and isotopic comparison in the technical report.\n\nThe exhibition A Portrait of Antinous, in Two Parts was on view at the Art Institute of Chicago, April 2\u2013September 5, 2016.

I thank Elizabeth Hahn Benge for bringing this to my attention.\n\nVasi and Vasi, Itin\u00e9raire instructif de Rome, p. 199 (\u201cun buste d\u2019Antino\u00fcs\u201d); Rossini, Il Mercurio errante, p. 93 (\u201cil Busto di Antino\u201d). I am grateful to Jack Perry Brown for drawing attention to early travel guides as important sources of information.\n\nIt is uncertain when in the Renaissance portraits of Antinous were recognized as representing the historical figure, but knowledge of and an interest in him grew considerably between the sixteenth and the eighteenth centuries. See Vout, \u201cAntinous, Archaeology and History,\u201d pp. 83\u201384, 87; and Vout, Power and Eroticism, p. 77, where the author notes that Antinous\u2019s iconography was known by 1517 from coins, medallions, and gems.\n\nRaspi Serra, Il primo incontro, p. 143.\n\nWinckelmann, Ville e palazzo, pp. 250 (\u201cDer Kopf ist wahrhaftig neu.

Corey Brennan scanned the relevant pages, and Elizabeth Hahn Benge carefully scrutinized all the inventories.\n\nAt 68 cm (26 1/2 in.) high, including the socle, the Altemps bust is over life-size. See Palma, Museo Nazionale Romano, p. 86, for 1641 inventory, no. 113 (\u201ctesta e petto d\u2019Antonio maggiore del vero\u201d). Other busts in this inventory are likewise described only as a head and chest, suggesting that the author was unfamiliar with the typology of the bust. For the location, see Palma, Museo Nazionale Romano, p. 86 (\u201cNella prima entrata di detto Palazzo\u201d). Elizabeth Hahn Benge and Letizia Rustico of the Palazzo Altemps attempted to consult the original manuscript of the 1641 inventory, \u201c28 aprile 1641 morte del duca di Fiano Orazio Ludovisi Inventario di tutte le statue che stanno di fuora, e di dentro delli Palazzi e per il Giardino dell\u2019Eccmo.

In the letter, Geldzahler wrote that he was sending a single photograph of the portrait, but three images appear on the photocopy of the letter he later supplied. To date, neither Geldzahler\u2019s original letter to Maxon nor a copy of the written response he told Louise Berge he received have been located in the Art Institute\u2019s files; see Louise Berge to James N. Wood, Feb. 4, 1983, memorandum, Institutional Archives, Art Institute of Chicago. However, a carbon copy of Geldzahler\u2019s letter to Maxon was located in the files of the Department of Greek and Roman Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; Sarah Szeliga to Elizabeth Hahn Benge, Aug. 13, 2014, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBob Combs to Karen Manchester, July 18, 2014, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTemporary receipt number 2843, Mar. 2, 1983, Institutional Archives, Art Institute of Chicago. The information on this receipt was copied directly from the original registrar\u2019s accession card documenting its arrival at the Art Institute of Chicago and therefore erroneously records that the portrait was still attached to its former slab. It also states that the reason for its presence in the museum is \u201crestoration,\u201d by which Berge, who signed the receipt, meant \u201crestoring it to its rightful owner,\u201d not \u201crepair.\u201d\n\nRaymond Foye to Elizabeth Hahn Benge, Aug. 27, 2015, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRaymond Foye to Karen Manchester, Sept. 23, 2015, e-mail correspondence, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nI thank Jack Perry Brown for suggesting a search of this publication and to Elizabeth Hahn Benge for locating the illustration.\n\nJames N. Wood to Henry Geldzahler, Mar. 10, 1983, Institutional Archives, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nVout, Power and Eroticism, pp. 113\u201321.\n\nSotheby\u2019s, New York, Antiquities, lot 9; for more on Thyssen\u2019s purchase, see Reyburn, \u201cLure of Antiquities.\u201d\n\nForge and Lynch, Roman Marble Bust.\n\nVout, Power and Eroticism, pp. 113\u201321; for the Ecclesia Antinoi, see www.antinopolis.org/religion/ecclesia.htm.\n\nCalcite (the hexagonal form \u03b2-CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is the most thermodynamically stable form of calcium carbonate. Other forms are the orthorhombic \u03bb-CaCO<sub>3</sub>, known as the mineral aragonite, and \u03bc-CaCO<sub>3</sub>, known as the mineral vaterite. See Ropp, Encyclopedia of the Alkaline Earth Compounds, pp. 359\u201370. Calcite is composed of 56 percent calcium oxide (CaO) and 44 percent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), although manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), or magnesium (Mg) may be present in trace amounts in place of calcium. See Pough, Field Guide to Rocks, p. 145.\n\nThe term iron oxide refers to any one of a range of chemical compounds made up of iron and oxygen. All together there are sixteen known oxides and oxyhydroxides. There are two primary forms of the oxide in nature, designated (II) and (III), although some compounds can incorporate both. Rust, for example, is known as iron(II, III) oxide and has the chemical structure Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but the (II, III) label is also applied to magnetite, a compound with the structure Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. In most cases numerical notations describe the chemical structure and do not relate to the appearance of the oxide. Generally speaking, however, iron oxide with heavy (II) concentrations tends to be deep black or charcoal in color, while those with a (III) composition fall more in the reddish-brown range of the spectrum. See Cornell and Schwertmann, Iron Oxides. Hematite\u2014iron(III) oxide or ferric oxide\u2014is the most abundant and most important ore of iron and has been of use to humans since the beginning of the Iron Age. It is composed of 70 percent iron and 30 percent oxygen. It occurs in a wide variety of forms and colors, but irrespective of its appearance it exhibits a distinctive reddish-brown streak that serves to distinguish it from other common minerals. See Pough, Field Guide to Rocks, pp. 113\u201315.\n\nThe thin-section petrography and X-ray diffraction were performed at the Laboratorio di Analisi dei Materiali Antichi (LAMA), Universit\u00e0 IUAV, Venice, by Lorenzo Lazzarini, Director, LAMA. The purpose of the minero-petrographic analysis was to determine the following parameters: (1) the type of fabric (either homeoblastic or heteroblastic, the former consisting of grains of roughly equal dimensions and the latter consisting of grains of variable dimensions), which is directly related to the type of metamorphism (equilibrium, nonequilibrium, retrograde, or polymetamorphism); (2) the boundary shapes of the calcite/dolomite grains, which are also correlated with the types of metamorphic events that generated the marble; (3) the maximum grain size, a parameter that has diagnostic significance because it is linked to the grade of metamorphism achieved by the marble; and (4) the qualitative and semiqualitative presence of accessory minerals, which are sometimes of diagnostic value. In the formulation of the petrographic description, previous specific studies of the most important \u201cmajor\u201d ancient marbles (Gorgoni et al., \u201cReference Database\u201d; Lazzarini, Moschini, and Stievano, \u201cContribution to the Identification\u201d), other archaeometric studies of \u201cminor\u201d marbles, and seminal treatises on petrotectonics (e.g., Spry, Metamorphic Textures) were taken into consideration. Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d pp. 1\u20132. This essay is greatly indebted not only to Lorenzo Lazzarini\u2019s analysis, which facilitated a better understanding of this object in the newly cast light of its secure attribution with respect to marble type and provenance, but also to his graciousness and generosity in sharing the vast knowledge and wisdom acquired over the course of his decades-long career.\n\nThe degree of crystal decohesion may be determined in thin section by observing whether the sample has very marked crystal boundaries (indicating little or no decohesion), intercrystalline microcracks, intracrystalline microcracks, or inter- and intracrystalline microcracks (indicating very strong decohesion). Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d p. 3.\n\nThe identification of Carrara marble with the naked eye is often difficult, because it may be confused with Pentelic, Dokimeion, and G\u00f6ktepe marbles. Its archaeometric identification can also be challenging if only petrographic analysis is used, as it is very similar to Pentelic and Dokimeion marbles, but a secure attribution may be made using isotopic analysis. On the other hand, Carrara marble can be more easily distinguished from G\u00f6ktepe marble by petrographic than by isotopic analysis. Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d pp. 3, 4. For further information, see Attanasio, Bruno, and Yavuz, \u201cQuarries in the Region of Aphrodisias\u201d; and Monna and Pensabene, Marmi dell\u2019Asia Minore, pp. 29\u201377.\n\nMarmor lunense, so called by the Romans because the quarries were under the control of the town of Luna, near Carrara, was quarried to a limited extent by the Etruscans from the sixth to the second centuries B.C. Later, from the middle of the first century B.C. to the end of the second century A.D, it was quarried in larger amounts. At the end of this period, the canal harbor on the Magra River silted up, making it difficult and expensive to transport the marble from the quarries to Rome and thus leading to a precipitous drop in its use in the capital. The main quarries were situated along the three valleys of Torano, Miseglia, and Colonnata in the province of Carrara. The best marble\u2014pure white with a fine, homogeneous grain size, referred to as statuario\u2014was quarried in the Torano valley. Given the large supply, marmor lunense would have been quite inexpensive. Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d p. 3. See also Bruno et al., \u201cProvenance and Distribution of White Marbles\u201d; Dolci, Carrara; Gnoli, Marmora romana; Lazzarini, \u201cConsiderazioni sul prezzo dei marmi\u201d; and Paribeni, \u201cProblemi del marmo.\u201d\n\nThe stable isotope ratio analysis was done at the Isotopen Labo, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany, and interpreted by Lorenzo Lazzarini, Director, LAMA. Isotopic characterization has proved to be very useful in the identification of ancient marble. Its use is becoming more and more widespread owing to its outstanding sensitivity, the small quantity of material necessary for the analysis, and the availability of a rapidly growing isotopic database, often associated with other laboratory methodologies (Attanasio, Brilli, and Ogle, Isotopic Signature of Classical Marbles; Barbin et al., \u201cCathodoluminescence\u201d; Gorgoni et al., \u201cReference Database\u201d; Lazzarini, \u201cArchaeometric Aspects of White and Coloured Marbles\u201d), that permits increasingly trustworthy comparisons, especially if the isotopic data are evaluated together with the minero-petrographic results from the same samples, as in the present study. The present study used reference data from petrographic databases as well as data compiled from thin-section samples taken in fifty ancient Mediterranean marble quarries. Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d pp. 2, 3.\n\nIsotopic analysis was carried out on the carbon dioxide derived from a small portion (20\u201330 mg) of the powdered sample obtained through dissolution by phosphoric acid at 25\u00b0C in a vacuum line, according to the procedure suggested by McCrea, \u201cIsotopic Chemistry of Carbonates,\u201d and Craig, \u201cIsotopic Standards for Carbon and Oxygen.\u201d The resulting carbon dioxide was then analyzed using mass spectrometry. The mass spectrometer is fitted with a triple collector and permits the measurement of both isotopic ratios (<sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C and <sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O) at the same time. The analytical results are conventionally expressed in \u03b4 units, in parts per thousand, in which \u03b4 = (R<sub>sample</sub>/R<sub>std</sub> \u2013 1) \u00d7 1000, and R<sub>sample</sub> and R<sub>std</sub> represent the isotopic ratios of oxygen and carbon in the sample and in the reference standard, respectively. The standard adopted is PDB, or \u03b4<sup>13</sup>C, for both oxygen and carbon. The PDB standard for isotope ratio measurements in carbonates is the rostrum of the Belemnitella americana, a Cretaceous marine fossil from the Pee Dee Formation in South Carolina. Lazzarini, \u201cReport on the Results,\u201d p. 2.\n\nFor a fuller discussion of the use and handling of the tools mentioned in this section (including the subtle difference imparted to the carving by altering the strike angle or hold of the tool), as well as diagrammatic representations of each tool, see Rockwell, Art of Stoneworking, pp. 31\u201368. For a brief discussion of the artisans themselves (their training, workshops, status, etc.) as well as a more concise summary of marble-working tools and techniques see Claridge, \u201cMarble Carving Techniques.\u201d\n\nUltraviolet-induced visible light fluorescence was among the first technical examination methods to be employed in the service of investigating art objects, and, although there is some subjectivity in the interpretation of the fluorescence, it remains the technique most universally chosen as a first step in examining works of art. UV radiation causes unique patterns of fluorescence in a wide array of materials, and the color and intensity of the fluorescence help to differentiate between original materials and alterations, be they wholesale additions or surface modifications. Very broadly speaking, with respect to marble, a newly broken or modern surface will appear bright purple when exposed to UV radiation, whereas an intact, ancient surface will appear white, yellow, or amber. An older but not necessarily ancient surface will appear more blue. See Rorimer, Ultra-Violet Rays, pp. 17\u201323. This phenomenon can be exploited to reveal parts of a sculpture that may have been recently cleaned or treated; may have been recut or replaced; or may retain pigments, coatings, or colorants. See Grossman and Maish, \u201cAuthenticity of a Classical Attic Funerary Monument.\u201d For further information on the refinement of UV/visible fluorescence imaging since 1931 and its reliability in the examination of marble artifacts, see Polikreti, \u201cDetection of Ancient Marble Forgery\u201d; Polikreti and Christofides, \u201cComposition Profiles and Time Evolution\u201d; Polikreti and Christofides, \u201cLaser-Induced Micro-photoluminescence\u201d; and Polikreti and Christofides, \u201cRole of Humic Substances.\u201d\n\n\u200bVisual examination and optical microscopy were performed under normal and raking light and ultraviolet radiation. Technical imaging and multispectral imaging, such as visible-induced luminescence, were not performed.\u200b\n\nArchaeological marbles are often discovered as a result of agricultural or construction-related activities, and it is not uncommon for these objects to bear scars inflicted by plow blades, pitchforks, shovels, or excavation equipment.\n\nThis restoration, as well as a restoration to the neck for which no evidence remains, had been removed by the early 1960s, as documented in photographs taken at the time. This assemblage of the fragment and restorations had been mounted to a marble plaque sometime prior to 1898 so as to suggest that the portrait formed part of a relief. For further information about the appearance of the fragment when it was acquired by the Art Institute\u2019s president, see Curatorial Entry, para. 3.\n\nFor further information on this type of colonization see Weber et al., \u201cRespiration-Induced Weathering Patterns.\u201d\n\nThe presence of oxalates was determined using Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy. See Pozzi, \u201cAnalytical Report,\u201d Sept. 9, 2013. Oxalate films are formed by the chemical reaction of various substances to produce weddellite (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\u00b72H<sub>2</sub>O) and whewellite (CaC<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>\u00b7H<sub>2</sub>O), both of which are transparent, crystalline materials. Oxalate films on stone, however, appear opaque and compact and display a broad range of colors from ivory to black. The color of oxalate films is a consequence of the entrapment of foreign material such as soot and microorganisms. Two general arguments are put forth for the presence of oxalates on stone. The first assumes a natural biological origin (biogenic), in which oxalic acid, present as a metabolic by-product of living organisms such as lichens, fungi, or algae, is responsible for oxalate formation. The second posits human intervention (anthropogenic); in this case, it is asserted that oxalates form as a result of coatings deliberately applied for protection or preservation or as a result of environmental pollution. Increasingly, however, scholars support a combined origin for these films. Oxalates are the subject of extensive debate. Indeed, two international symposia on the subject were held in 1989 and 1996. See Alessandri, Oxalate Films; and Realini and Toniolo, Oxalate Films. A concise discussion and fully comprehensive bibliography on oxalate films compiled by Sari Uricheck appears in Castelnuovo-Tedesco and Soultanian, Italian Medieval Sculpture, p. 31, n. 31.\n\nThe samples were taken by John Twilley on Oct. 12, 2014. Analyses were carried out using micropetrographic cross sections, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Loose particles of the sampled deposits were mounted for SEM examination and elemental analysis as fracture sections, without further preparation other than carbon coating to increase electrical conductivity. Three examples were embedded and formally prepared as petrographic cross sections using nonstandard methods designed to ensure the retention of all species of interest, including any that might be water soluble or water reactive. They were embedded in low-viscosity epoxy under vacuum and subsequently cured at 60\u00b0C, a temperature sufficiently low to avoid dehydration of gypsum, which is often the most vulnerable hydrated phase in burial deposits. The embedded samples were then ground and polished to a one-micron finish. The resulting cross sections were examined using a reflected-light microscope at magnifications up to 1,000\u00d7, and at higher magnifications in the scanning electron microscope (after coating with evaporated carbon), where elemental analyses were performed with the associated energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Limited examination using Raman microspectroscopy was also carried out, but it added little to the information obtainable by other methods. For detailed information on the location of each sample, a thorough discussion of the analytical results, and relevant photomicrographs and spectra, see Twilley, \u201cTechnical Examination and Analysis.\u201d\n\nHydraulic mortars differ from simple lime mortars in their setting reactions. In lime mortars, setting occurs by the recarbonation of slaked quicklime (calcium hydroxide) through the uptake of carbon dioxide from the air. This is a slow process that requires dampness to proceed, and the strength of lime mortars is slow to develop. They are also somewhat susceptible to dissolution over long periods of exposure to water. Modern hydraulic mortars derive most of their strength from the reaction of furnace products with water to form stable, hydrated products. This does not depend upon the uptake of carbon dioxide and provides a rapid set. Lime mortars were common through the Bronze and Iron Ages. By the Roman period, however, it had been discovered that certain volcanic ash deposits yielded a fine sand that accelerated the development of strength in lime mortars with which they were mixed. These deposits of pozzolana provided a form of fired mineral matter that possessed a modest degree of hydraulic setting when mixed with the highly alkaline lime mortar. The primary effect of their addition was to stiffen the mortar sufficiently that it would bear a modest load while full development of its strength occurred as the lime carbonated. With increasing experience, the Romans developed formulas for mortar, based on the most effective pozzolanas, that took advantage of greater water resistance than lime alone could provide, eventually achieving mortar that could be used for underwater construction (of harbors, for example), where traditional lime mortars would not function due to their inability to carbonate under water. In time, it was found that terra-cotta and brick dust exhibited some of the same properties as the volcanic ash, and pulverized terra-cotta came to be added to lime mortar for the same reasons. Roman plasters for the rendering of walls and mortars for the setting of mosaics often employed sand-size terra-cotta or brick dust. Such materials owe their red color to fine-grained hematite formed when the iron associated with clays forms a separate iron oxide phase in the course of firing. The firing of terra-cotta results in the destruction of the clay minerals and the formation of new, high-temperature phases that exhibit distinctive microstructures. It was not until the nineteenth century that industrial refinements brought about major changes and the advent of fully hydraulic cements, typified by portland cement. These are made by the kiln firing of limestone and clay under much higher temperatures than those required for the firing of terra-cotta. The result is a very hard gray or (if desired) white ceramic that then has to be pulverized to dust and that reacts with water to set over the course of a few hours. The much higher temperatures and narrowly defined ingredients lead to distinctive calcium silicate and calcium aluminate microstructures that are not found in nature and that differ significantly from the microstructures of weakly hydraulic ingredients used in preindustrial times. In all cases, the water-reactive components develop hydration products that partially replace the high-temperature phases when the mortars react with water, providing a second level of distinctive microstructural features.\n\nThe date of this intervention was supplied by Craig McBride, at that time technical assistant in the Department of Oriental and Classical Art, in a personal communication to Karen Manchester, Aug. 12, 2014.\n\nBruno, \u201cTreatment Report,\u201d Aug. 5, 1993.\n\nSchnepp, \u201cTreatment Report,\u201d June 25, 2007.\n\nSabino, \u201cTreatment Note,\u201d June 12, 2013.\n\nFor other possible scenarios of the sculpture\u2019s fragmentation, burial, and dispersal, see Curatorial Entry, para. 16.\n\nThe Art Institute is most grateful to Andrzej Dajnowski, director of the Conservation of Sculpture and Objects Studio, Inc., in Chicago, for creating the cast, the exigencies of which presented a unique set of technical challenges, amplified by a very short turnaround time, and required a tremendous degree of knowledge and practical skill.\n\nThe second sample from the portrait fragment was taken by Rachel Sabino on Jan. 30, 2014, and sent to Lorenzo Lazzarini, Director, LAMA, for analysis.\n\nThe sample from the Altemps bust was taken on Dec. 17, 2013, by Lorenzo Lazzarini, Director, LAMA.\n\nThe stable isotope ratio analysis was carried out at the Isotopen Labo, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany, and interpreted by Lorenzo Lazzarini, Director, LAMA.\n\nThe delta values for carbon are identical. The slightly more negative fractionation of the oxygen isotopes in the Chicago fragment is a negligible difference that may be due to the fact that the samples came from different locations on the parent block or that the history of the objects varied in terms of environmental exposure, burial conditions, and other factors. As the maximum grain size of Carrara marble normally varies from 0.4 to 1.2 mm, it comes as no surprise to see some variation within an area of a few decimeters. Lorenzo Lazzarini to Karen Manchester, Mar. 18, 2014, and Lorenzo Lazzarini to John Twilley, June 13, 2015, e-mail correspondence, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Sampling limitations must be borne in mind when interpreting the scientific data, both with respect to the limited number and size of the samples and to the representative nature of the sampling sites on the surface. The extent of reference data available for the quarry of origin can also affect the final interpretation. In this case the results from complementary, physical methods\u2014as described in the section Digital comparison\u2014present the most compelling evidence that the two parts belong together.\n\nThis portion of the project was carried out at Studio MCM, srl, in Rome by Roberto Bonavenia, Francesco Borgogni, Monica Cola, and Franco Trasatti. Advancing technology in many forms plays an increasingly important role in answering the difficult questions often posed by ancient objects. In this case, developments in the manufacturing and industrial sectors have afforded us the opportunity to make an idea, posited more than a decade ago, into a reality. We at the Art Institute are extremely fortunate to have been able to work alongside such capable colleagues, without whom the realization of this exciting phase of the project would not have been possible.\n\nClairmont, Die Bildnisse des Antinous.\n\nFor additional illustrations, see Curatorial Entry, para. 8.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 9 Fragment of a Portrait Head of Antinous, mid-2nd century A.D.\n\nfig. 9.27 Fragment of a Portrait Head of Antinous (mid-2nd century A.D.).
