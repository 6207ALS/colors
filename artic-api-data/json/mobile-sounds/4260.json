    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator Janice Katz</p>\n<p>Janice Katz: So this a panoramic bird\u2019s-eye view of the city of Edo, known today as Tokyo, and this<br>painting is from the early 19 th century. It was just recently, before this painting was done, that Edo<br>actually became the largest city in the world in terms of population, larger than Paris, larger than Rome,<br>larger than London. Ukiyo-e\u2014pictures of the floating world\u2014is imagery that sprang up from life in this<br>urban setting. From people interacting with one another and enjoying the pleasures of the kabuki theater,<br>seasonal entertainments, the pleasure quarters. And it\u2019s important to under where the floating world was<br>centered, where they are in the urban landscape so that you can understand how people were moving<br>about the city, how they were interacting with one another, the size of the city at the time.</p>\n<p>On the pair of folding screens, notice the small people going about their daily business, going to temples,<br>shrines, working in the fields, enjoying themselves with seasonal activities and festivals; and these small<br>figures were then focused on and writ large on the hanging scrolls you see throughout the rest of the<br>exhibition.</p>\n",
