    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: America After the Fall, History Renewed.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN: There\u2019s certainly a Washington mania in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Assistant curator of American art at the Art Institute of Chicago, Annelise Madsen.<br>Annelise Madsen:  Washington\u2019s 200th birthday would have been in 1932. He was part of the culture.</p>\n<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt:  Washington\u2019s birthday is a most appropriate occasion for us to talk with each other about things as they are today and things as we know they shall be in the future.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  \u201cParson Weems\u2019 Fable\u201d by Grant Wood 1939.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN: So the man in the front of the painting is Parson Weems himself. He\u2019s drawing back a curtain to show us the story of young George Washington and the cherry tree. Washington, as a boy, he\u2019s six years old. He chops down a cherry tree. His father catches him in the act, and this is the crucial moment displayed here where he says, \u201cI can\u2019t tell a lie.\u201d</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: George just, you know, rushes up in his little child\u2019s body with his completely adult head and his hatchet and said, \u201cI cannot tell a lie. I did this.\u201d Well, that never happened. But it was a great story and people loved it. And so Wood is painting these American scenes sort of tongue in check.</p>\n<p>Man 1:  Why don\u2019t you follow the example of a man like George Washington and be truthful.</p>\n<p>Man 2:  I\u2019ve never heard of him.</p>\n<p>Man 1:  You brainless tadpole.</p>\n<p>ANNELISE MADSEN:  Weems is prominently positioned at the front of this painting because he is the story\u2019s inventor. Wood here presents the act of mythmaking itself. Wood is not doing it to pull the wool over his audience\u2019s eye. We\u2019re allowed to see the kind of building blocks that he\u2019s putting together to tell his story. And we know, we\u2019re a knowing viewer. We know that he\u2019s playing with history.</p>\n",
