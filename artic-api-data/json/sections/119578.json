Her story was rediscovered in the 1880s by Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy and his wife, Jane, in their excavation of the palaces of Darius and Artaxerxes at Susa in present-day Iran. Densely drawn in black colored pencil and charcoal, this composition can stand independently of the adjacent sheets. Touches of red gouache accentuate the suspended heart and the blood flowing from the eunuch\u2019s body, highlighting Parysatis\u2019s identity as a vengeful and threatening woman. Ensor reproduced this composition in the etching Queen Parysatis (fig. 1), where he identified the subject and reversed it through the printmaking process. This suggests he viewed certain components of the large work as self-contained compositions. The Art Institute\u2019s impression is inscribed by Ensor on the verso La reine Parysatis \u00e9corchant un eunuque / Fragment d\u2019apr\u00e8s mon dessin La Tentation de Saint Antoine (Queen Parysatis skinning a eunuch / Fragment after my drawing The Temptation of Saint Anthony). There is light scratching in the central figure\u2019s face. Anthony\u2019s halo appears in the bottom left corner. SMC/KJN\n\nThis image of Queen Parysatis flaying the eunuch Masabates illustrates a passage from Plutarch\u2019s Lives of Illustrious Men:\n\nOne day, finding Artaxerxes wanted something to pass away the time, she [Parysatis] challenged him to play for a thousand darics, and purposely managed her dice so ill, that she lost. She paid the money immediately, but pretended to be much chagrined, and called on him to play again for a eunuch. He consented to the proposal, and they agreed each of them to except five of their most faithful eunuchs; the winner was to have his choice out of the rest. On these conditions they played. The queen, who had the affair at heart, exerted all her skill, and being favored besides, by the dice, won the eunuch, and pitched upon Mesabates, who was not of the number of the excepted. He was immediately delivered to her and before the king suspected any thing of her intentions, she put him in the hands of the executioners, with orders to flay him alive, and fix his body on three stakes, and to stretch out his skin by itself. The king was highly incensed, and expressed his resentment in strong terms: but she only said in a laughing ironical way, \u201cThis is pleasant indeed, that you must be so angry about an old useless eunuch, while I say not a word of my loss of a thousand darics.\u201d (Plutarch\u2019s Lives, trans. John Langhorne and William Langhorne [William and Joseph Neal, 1831], pp. 695\u201396. Ensor may have consulted Plutarch, Les vies des hommes illustres, trans. D. Ricard, vol. 4, Artaxerxe [Dubois, 1827], p. 776.)\n\nThe scene is also depicted in a drypoint, The Flaying (fig. 2), which was likely copied directly from The Temptation. As the print is the mirror image of the drawn sheet, Ensor probably drew on the plate with the dry point, limiting himself to the main figures. As noted above, he copied the same image a second time in 1899, also reversed, but in a more detailed and precise fashion (fig. 1). Other drawings, such as The Execution (fig. 3) and Small Persian Torture (fig. 4), address similar themes.
