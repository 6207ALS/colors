    "description": "<p>The Kaweco Classic Sport rollerball pen in red is just as expressive as the written words themselves. A real statement when it comes to writing.</p><p>The Kaweco Sport was born in 1911. The pocket rollerball pen only measures 10.5 cm when closed, and it grows to a normal size of 13 cm when the cap is mounted. The invention of the rollerball made writing particularly easy and fluid. The ink flows uninterrupted over the ceramic ball onto the paper surface. We are especially proud of the exceptionally soft writing feel of our rollerball system.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5.31 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Rollerball writing system</li></ul>",
