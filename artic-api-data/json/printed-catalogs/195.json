    "copy": " In 1903 the Art Institute of Chicago became the first American museum to buy a canvas by Claude Monet (1840\u20131926), beginning a tradition of collecting that has inextricably connected this midwestern city to the French Impressionist painter. Tracing Chicago\u2019s bold embrace of the artist and his innovative work, this generously illustrated volume not only features well-known works in the Art Institute\u2019s holdings, such as the six Stacks of Wheat paintings and four Water Lilies , but also includes works on paper and rarely seen still lifes, landscapes, and photographic ephemera from private Chicago collections. Stunning reproductions of details at actual size, a curatorial introduction, and a delightful essay by Adam Gopnik, together with a richly illustrated chronology, combine to reveal the depth of the city\u2019s essential role in fostering modern art in the United States.   Edited by Gloria Groom With an essay by Adam Gopnik and a chronology by Kathryn Kremnitzer   144 pages, 10 \u00d7 10 in. 104 color + b/w ills.
