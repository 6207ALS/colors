It apparently descended to her daughter Elizabeth (Jones) Gray Jones (born 1731), and was eventually inherited by the latter\u2019s grandson, Robert Erwin Gray (1787\u20131870). A direct connection between Kinsey and Erwin has not yet been determined, other than that they were contemporaries and both belonged to prosperous families. After Erwin\u2019s death, Kinsey and William Jones, Elizabeth Gray Jones\u2019s second husband, were neighbors at 174 and 178 Market Street and each listed in the Pennsylvania census and Philadelphia city directories as \u201cgrazier\" (owner of cattle), which may indicate they had long-standing business ties. It is possible that the engraved inscription was commemorative, added at a later date when the cann passed from one generation to another. Elizabeth Gray Jones also owned a waiter by John Bayly, Sr., or Jr., that may have belonged to her mother; it descended to Elizabeth\u2019s son William Gray, who was Robert Erwin Gray\u2019s paternal uncle.\n\nWith its relatively simple, \u201cbellied\u201d shape, the Art Institute\u2019s cann is characteristic of surviving work marked by Bayly, Sr. Born in the city, he probably trained with one of Philadelphia\u2019s leading silversmiths, Philip Syng, Jr. In the early 1750s Bayly established his first shop \u201cat the sign of the Tea-pot\u201d on Front Street. A legacy from his father enabled him to supplement the products of his shop with an extensive array of jewelry, tools, and other goods imported from Britain. His establishment must have included other workmen, although his only recorded apprentice was Thomas Shields (see cat. 33). Bayly also presumably trained his son and namesake, John Bayly, Jr., and possibly two enslaved \u201cNegroe Lads . . . which can work at the Goldsmith Trade,\u201d whom Bayly offered for sale in 1763. He oversaw production of the full range of hollowware for clients in New Jersey and Delaware as well as Philadelphia and, in addition, retailed pieces made by other silversmiths; in August 1763 he advertised \u201ca neat assortment of London and Philadelphia made plate.\u201d However, his ability to retail London-made silver was curtailed after November 1765, when he signed the Philadelphia Non-Importation Agreement, pledging to boycott British goods in protest of the Stamp Act.\n\nBy the second half of the 1760s, Bayly owned substantial property both in Philadelphia and elsewhere that yielded a significant income. His wealth apparently evaporated several years later, as he accumulated significant debt and declared bankruptcy by the end of 1769; subsequently, his shop goods were auctioned off by creditors and his real estate holdings were sold. Bayly continued working as a silversmith, advertising in December 1769, \u201cEvery one may depend upon it, that he will exert himself, as much as lies in his power, to perform his work with all the care, dispatch and nicety, that can be required.\u201d At the time of the Revolutionary War, Bayly\u2019s wife, Jane Watkins, inherited interests in Philadelphia real estate, which further helped reestablish his career. His last shop was located in one of these properties in the city\u2019s Mulberry Ward. Bayly continued to purchase both parts and finished wares from other silversmiths, including Shields, his former apprentice (see cat. 33). His final newspaper advertisement appeared in November 1783; beyond this, the latest evidence for Bayly\u2019s activity as a craftsman is his listing in the 1785 city directory.\n\nThe 1778 date in the cann\u2019s inscription suggests its probable date of manufacture, raising the possibility that the object was executed by Bayly, Jr., as none of the Bayly marks can be definitively attributed exclusively to his father. Unlike his father, Bayly, Jr., never advertised in newspapers, and his transactions were rarely documented in public records. He lived in the Dock Ward, a different part of the city than Bayly, Sr., and evidently did not work with his father after he reached adulthood in the mid-1770s. It is unclear whether he operated a shop in Philadelphia or worked for other silversmiths. At some point in the late 1780s or early 1790s, he moved to New Castle County, Delaware, where he may have continued working as a silversmith prior to his death at about age fifty-five.  \nDavid L.
