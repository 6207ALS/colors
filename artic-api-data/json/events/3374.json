    "description": "<p><strong>The theme for this month\u2019s Intersections is Disability: Access and Representation</strong></p><p>In this month's Intersections we will explore how works of art represent people with disabilities and how those depictions shape our society. Public portrayals of disabled people have effects and consequences which are actively and powerfully shaping disabled people\u2019s lives in very tangible ways. Over recent decades, an emerging concern for the social and political effects of representation has ignited a shift in the portrayals of such diverse communities. Join facilitators Jack Gruszczynski and Kat Seno to reckon with the history of access and representation through the lens of artworks in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information. </p>",
