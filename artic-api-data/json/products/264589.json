    "description": "Print developed from Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2019s Two Sisters (On the Terrace), 1881, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater\u2019s blue flannel, is posed in the center. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that\u2014like a stage set\u2014seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;10.3 x 12.75 in.</li><li><strong>Full Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;16 x 20 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Premium cardstock.</li></ul>",
