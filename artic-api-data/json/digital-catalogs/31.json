    "copy": " Matisse: Paintings, Works on Paper, Sculpture, and Textiles at the Art Institute of Chicago highlights the ten paintings, five bronzes, forty-one works on paper, and one textile by Henri Matisse in the museum\u2019s collection. These extraordinary objects narrate the numerous stylistic and thematic paths the artist explored and present a comprehensive story of his entire career. Highlights include an extended entry on Bathers by a River , in which our curatorial and conservation colleagues use state-of-the-art imaging to \u201cexcavate\u201d the canvas, charting how the artist\u2019s radical changes to composition and palette marked a creative evolution at a pivotal moment in his career.   Edited by Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, with entries by Kristi Dahm, Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, Kathleen Kiefer, Kristin Hoermann Lister, Katja Rivera, Brandon Ruud, Marin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr, Suzanne Schnepp, Mel Becker Solomon, Martha Tedeschi, Kirk Vuillemot, Daniel S.
