This is certainly true of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sketchbooks.\n\nThis double-sided drawing comes from a disassembled sketchbook that Gauguin used during his first stay in Tahiti (1891\u201393). The image of the female head on the recto is one among many that the artist recorded as he encountered the native population and settings of the island (see, for example, fig. 36.2), seeking to immerse himself in Tahitian life before he began to commit his experiences and ideas to more enduring forms of visual expression. In his paintings, sculptures, and works on paper, Gauguin utilized such descriptive sketches, often in combination with motifs and forms he found in the photographs of ancient, European, Asian, and contemporary art with which he traveled. The often-mysterious quality of so many of his works rests in part on the tensions and harmonies of his wedding of observation and imagination.\n\nEven in the modest sketch on the recto of the present sheet, Gauguin revealed a decorative approach to his subject, simplifying form in defiance of Western pictorial conventions. The artist situated himself slightly above the figure so that the viewer looks down at her as she turns her head, which flattens the planes of her face and makes her eyes appear almost closed. Gauguin rendered her nose without providing any indication of its volume, using just two short lines to suggest the bridge. Quickly applied hatched lines give texture to the woman\u2019s hair. They also signify shadow on her cheek and jaw.\n\nThe drawing appeared initially to have been executed in pen with brown ink; however, examination has revealed that the medium originally was purple (see Technical Study). This would have dramatically changed the appearance of the drawing, distancing it further from literal representation. Vincent van Gogh may have influenced Gauguin\u2019s use of this particular ink. During the several months in late 1888 that the two men lived and worked together in Arles, Van Gogh executed drawings in the same medium.\n\nThe verso (fig. 36.1) of the sheet contains quick line studies of noses, one seen frontally, another viewed from the side, as well as a cursory study of a head in profile, with protruding lips and nose. Whether or not Gauguin intended to emphasize racial difference here cannot be known, although supposed links between physiognomy and character were widely discussed in the nineteenth century. In any case, the artist may well have found enjoyment in the pattern made by the repeated, curved lines.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin used sketchbooks to record his many observations of daily life in Tahiti. While five sketchbooks remain bound, others were taken apart, their sheets removed from their bindings and often cut down into smaller sheets. Head of a Tahitian Woman is certainly one of these many small cuttings, and it is likely that Gauguin himself removed it from a sketchbook and cut it down. Two additional sheets in the Art Institute\u2019s collection have been similarly cut down into smaller sheets (see cat. 37 and cat. 38). On the verso there is an ill-defined, cropped group of sketches.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 36.3).\n\nThe portrait is drawn in pen and brown ink. Gauguin achieved modulations of tone by varying the amount of ink deposited by the pen and the pressure he exerted in its application. He was successful in doing so because the paper was fairly hard sized with a gelatin sizing. By using a sized paper with a smooth surface, the ink could sit high on the sheet, with little penetration into the paper fibers and with no bleeding or softening of the edges of the lines. Two inks of different intensities were used. Today, one appears lighter and more yellow in tone; the other, much darker and browner in tone although originally both were tones of purple (fig. 36.4).\n\nUnder magnification, pulled paper fibers are visible within the individual strokes where the tip of the pen caught the uppermost fibers and dragged them slightly from their initial position (fig. 36.5). It is likely that Gauguin used a pen with a metal nib; this pulling is rarely caused by a reed or quill pen, the tips of which are seldom hard enough to drag along the fibers of a well-sized paper.\n\nScientific analysis of the ink using XRF has confirmed the presence of chromium, a major component of chrome logwood ink. Bottled chrome logwood inks could be purchased in a variety of tones that ranged from bright purple to reddish mauve, and brownish purple to brownish black, depending on the amount of metal salts, such as iron, added. Higher metal-salt content would produce darker and blacker inks. The nature of the logwood dye used in the manufacture of the inks would determine the purple hue that could be obtained. However, the inherent instability of chrome logwood inks often results in the complete loss of their purple hues, as has occurred in this drawing.\n\nOnly minimal amounts of iron are present here, indicative of an ink formulation that was likely quite purple in tone. Despite the low levels of iron detected, the chromium-to-iron ratio does vary, depending on the intensity of the ink in the analyzed areas. This helps to confirm the presence of two different inks: a pale ink with low levels of chromium and a dark one with higher levels. Early chroniclers of Gauguin\u2019s drawings often referenced a range of colored inks from violette (purple) to bleue (blue) to black. Present-day viewers may find it difficult to imagine what Gauguin\u2019s ink sketches would have looked like as they first emerged from a pen loaded with purple ink. A digitial recolorization of Sketch of Maori Woman and Child (cat. 37), based on the study of unfaded ink samples, provides a hypothetical rendering (fig. 36.6).\n\nOn the verso, the various graphite sketches were likely not drawn at the same moment. Those in the bottom half of the sheet are drawn with a fine line and a light touch, using hard, silvery graphite. Those in the top half of the sheet are drawn using softer, blacker graphite applied with a heavy touch, so much so that the strokes incise the paper.\n\nThe paper is typical of a type that was often bound into Gauguin\u2019s sketchbooks\u2014poor-quality, thin, moderately sized, machine-made stock conducive to working in inks and watercolors or with charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. This sheet was hand torn along three of its edges; its physical characteristics, combined with its unusual size, indicate that it is a page removed from a sketchbook.\n\nThe sheet is identical in type to that used for Sketch of Maori Woman and Child (cat. 37) and Tahitian Eve (cat. 38), pages that were also likely removed from a disassembled sketchbook dating from Gauguin\u2019s first Tahitian voyage in 1891\u201393. Although the sheets upon which all of the sketches were drawn suffered significant discoloration due to overexposure to light, the sheets of paper are of a similar tone in areas that were protected from light; they have the same surface texture, weight, and wove paper mold characteristics. In them, the paper fibers display the same mesh pattern from the mold and appear evenly dispersed throughout when viewed in transmitted light. Under ultraviolet light the sheets fluoresce dull yellow, indicative of aged gelatin sizing. These similarities support the assertion that Head of a Tahitian Woman was once bound in a sketchbook, perhaps the very same sketchbook from which Sketch of a Maori Woman and Child and Tahitian Eve derive.\n\nNumbers inscribed on the versos of this sheet and Tahitian Eve, 59 and 54, respectively, appear to have been written in the same hand, possibly that of Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio in whose collection both sheets are known to have been a part (see Provenance). A fourth sheet, Standing Nude Woman, and a Figure Emerging from a Tree behind Her (fig. 36.7), was drawn in graphite on the same type of paper, and is probably another sheet from among this group. And finally, the sheet Hina (Maori Woman Stylized as an Idol), drawn in pen and purple ink, must be added to the group as well (fig. 36.8). At the very least, it can be asserted that these five sketches on identical paper are closely related and contain drawings made during a time when Gauguin was copiously documenting Tahitian subject matter.\n\n140 \u00d7 88 mm\n\nThe original paper tone was visible along the edges of the sheet that were once protected by a mat. Light exposure darkened the sheet from pale cream to light tan, and there was a dark mat burn along all four edges on the recto of the sheet as a result of contact with acidic materials. In anticipation of this publication, the drawing was conserved to reduce discoloration and even out the sheet tone.\n\nThe drawing is in sound, stable condition. The sheet tone is now even overall; mat burn does not detract from the appearance of the small sketch (fig. 36.9).  \nHarriet K.

Certainly, the incorporation of Western perceptions and ideas into his art can be explained not only because Gauguin was a Westerner but also because he wished to appeal to the Parisian market and inevitably created scenes of Tahitian life that he believed would further this ambition.\n\nFor more on this, see Linda Nochlin, \u201cThe Imaginary Orient,\u201d in The Politics of Vision: Essays on Nineteenth-Century Art and Society (Harper &amp; Row, 1989), p. 51.\n\nConservation studies done in the Netherlands determined that a number of drawings by Vincent van Gogh from the 1880s were executed in violet ink.

Weaver, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001).\n\nOn the history of the use of anatomical models, including the pseudoscience of physiognomy in nineteenth-century French art education, see Phillippe Comar, Andrea Carlino, Jean Clair, and Martial Gu\u00e9dron, eds., Figures du corps: Une le\u00e7on d\u2019anatomie \u00e0 l\u2019\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, exh. cat.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available the jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nI am grateful to C\u00e9line Daher for her XRF analysis and identification of chrome logwood ink.

To clarify his working practice, the brown and purple inks on forty-two drawings executed by Van Gogh during the period 1878\u201390 were identified using fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS).

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
