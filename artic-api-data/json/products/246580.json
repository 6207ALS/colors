    "description": "<p>Mark Rothko aimed to create paintings that achieved his ideal of \u201cthe simple expression of the complex thought.\u201d His signature compositions of two to four rectangular forms, aligned vertically against a color ground, create wide-ranging moods and atmospheric effects. Contemplating a Rothko painting can be akin to a spiritual experience. This book of postcards pays homage to the revolutionary abstract expressionist with 30 reproductions of his paintings.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Book: 6.875 x 4.75 x .375 in, Postcards: 6.5 x 4.75 in.</li><li><strong>Perforated for easy removal</strong></li><li><strong>30 postcards</strong></li></ul>",
