    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In 1991, Jeff Koons created this sculpture as part of his Made in Heaven exhibition, a provocative and often sexually graphic series of works that explored his physical relationship with his new wife, Ilona Staller, an Italian porn star. Associate Curator Kate Nesin.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: The title is \u201cBourgeois Bust Jeff and Ilona,\u201d and Bourgeois tends to mean most generically middle class, conventional, particularly conventional in one\u2019s taste, materialistic even.  I think in this context it also means relatable, that\u2019s a part of what Koons is getting at, a relatability when it comes to one\u2019s relationship or romantic fantasy, two people about to kiss, embodied in this, high art material.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Unlike his Pop predecessors, Koons isn\u2019t using mass produced images or processes and elevating them to \u2018high art.\u2019 Instead he references the \u2018high art\u2019 of 17th and 18th century Italian and French sculptors and turns it into something that looks almost mass produced, using the visual language of a contemporary romantic scene.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: There\u2019s the sense of the modern kitsch object, like a couple\u2019s  souvenir from a Hawaiian honeymoon or something.  At the same time that we can\u2019t not see the materials and the preciousness of them and the aesthetic tradition being summoned through them. There\u2019s a sense of this being maybe a bit of a winking object.  And yet it\u2019s, incredibly sincere.</p>\n",
