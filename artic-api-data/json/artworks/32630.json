While she painted numerous images of the region\u2019s rounded, gray hills, here she depicted a low, sandy crest that reminded her of her husband, Alfred Stieglitz, as she wrote to him: \u201cWhen I see the country in its silvery beauty and forbidding blackness in my memory\u2014it is so often almost as if I see you too\u2014your silvery hair and grey clothes and black cape.\u201d</p>\n",
