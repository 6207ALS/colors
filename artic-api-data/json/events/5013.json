A rescheduled date will be announced soon.&nbsp;</h2><p>\u00d3lafur Arnalds performs at the Art Institute as part of his final set of shows for his groundbreaking \"re:act\" tour.</p><p><strong>About the Artist </strong><br>Award-winning artist, composer, and producer \u00d3lafur Arnalds is back on the road with brand-new material. After a triumphant return to the stage in 2018, the \"re:act\" tour is Arnalds's final set of shows after nearly three years of touring.</p><p>Arnalds's performances continue to captivate audiences across the globe as he invites them to join him on a new journey where he presents his most personal and raw music to date\u2014a counterpoint to the exuberant energy of his latest album <em>re:member. </em>His haunting and often intensely emotional shows are an exercise in intimacy, a space for the artist and audience to share their vulnerability through music.</p><p>Arnalds and his team of fellow craftsmen and musicians put on a spellbinding performance featuring his signature string quartet, a live percussionist, and an arsenal of pianos and synthesizers. His innovative self-playing Stratus pianos will be along for the ride\u2014creating unexpected harmonies and surprising melodic sequences that make every performance unique.</p><p>Arnalds's tour for his 2018 studio album <em>re:member </em>was met with both critical and popular acclaim. He sold out arenas and concert halls around the world, captivating hundreds of thousands of fans at iconic venues such as the Royal Albert Hall in London, the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg, and the Sydney Opera House.</p><p>As Arnalds wraps up this part of his artistic life, he will pour everything he has into these last few shows before heading back into his creative cocoon in search of his next adventure.</p><p>Presented in partnership with Thalia Hall</p>",
