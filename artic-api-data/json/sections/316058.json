The animated, sun-drenched scenes suggest that the somber occasion nevertheless had its festive side, as spectators crowded to windows and balconies to watch the spectacle. Both of the \u201cParis Windows,\u201d as Whistler and Rosalind Birnie Philip frequently referred to these subjects, appeal to twentieth-century viewers for their directness and spontaneity. However, they were not popular during the artist\u2019s lifetime. No impressions of either subject sold during the Fine Art Society\u2019s 1895\u201396 exhibition of his lithographs, and the majority of the impressions printed by the Ways were still in Whistler\u2019s possession at the time of his death.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid Japanese vellum (331 \u00d7 241 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (333 \u00d7 239 mm), signed; SC, cream laid Japanese vellum (332 \u00d7 240 mm).
