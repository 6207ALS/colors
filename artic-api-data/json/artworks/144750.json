    "description": "<p>In a career that spanned almost 70 years, Irving Penn produced groundbreaking work in the overlapping industries of fashion and fine\u2013art photography. Still life played a central role for Penn, from his very first cover for Vogue in 1943 (an image of an arrangement of fashion accessories) to photographs made near the end of his life of vessels that he and his wife, Lisa Fonssagrives\u2013Penn, had collected during their travels. An homage to the domestic interiors of 17th\u2013century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, Still Life with Mouse is one such early example of Penn\u2019s interest in the still\u2013life genre. Vogue art director Alexander Liberman asked Penn to compose \u201cthe most symbolic picture of a farm kitchen\u201d for a January 1948 \u201cfarm\u201d issue of House and Garden. The published image was a cropped version of this photograph, in color, that included a model seated at left.</p>\n",
