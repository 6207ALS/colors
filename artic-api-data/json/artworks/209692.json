Born into an upper-middle-class family dedicated to music and the visual arts, Boch played the piano, organ, and violin and was a painter associated with the Belgian Neo-Impressionists. In 1885 she joined Les XX (The Twenty), a group of artists dissatisfied with the strictures of the official Salon who had decided to exhibit together, and was its sole female member. A promoter of the work of Vincent van Gogh, she bought his <em>Red Vineyard</em> painting in 1890, thought to be the only sale the artist made during his lifetime.</p>\n",
