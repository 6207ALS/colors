An early example of Frans Snyders\u2019s animated combination of highly ornamental still-life elements with secondary figures and a low viewpoint, this scene might have adorned the dining room of an aristo- cratic collector. Snyders was the leading Flemish painter of monumental still lifes. He regularly collaborated with his fellow Antwerp artist <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36487/peter-paul-rubens\">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, contributing fruits and animals to Rubens\u2019s compositions.</p>\n",
