Caelius Calvinus Balbinus and M. Clodius Pupienus Maximus were to reign as truly equal partners\u2014a novel idea in Roman government. They even shared the office of pontifex maximus. The reverse image of the coin shows their alleged accord; the inscription calls them the \u201cfathers of the Senate.\u201d The title Pater Senatus had first been granted to Commodus by the Senate in 182, out of terror of reprisals after a failed assassination attempt. These cofathers, at least, tried to deserve the honor. Pupienus, an experienced military man, was spared the need to face the usurper Maximinus Thrax (\u201cthe Thracian\u201d), who was murdered by his own troops that June. His portraits, as on this coin, suggest the weight of responsibility and a \u201chaunted apprehension.\u201d An insurrection by the Praetorian Guard\u2014ostensibly the imperial bodyguards\u2014ended the joint reign by fire and the sword. The Senate replaced them with Gordian III (see cat. 66, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Gordian III), bringing that year\u2019s total to six emperors.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Imperator Caesar Pupienus Maximus Augustus\n\nSusan Wood provides a formal analysis of Pupienus\u2019s surviving portraits: Wood, Roman Portrait Sculpture, pp. 34\u201338.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 65 Antoninianus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Pupienus, A.D. 238\n\n</section>",
