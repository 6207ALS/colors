Squared in graphite, the elaborate and pietistic composition would have been transferred point for point to the painted support. It is undoubtedly one of the masterpieces of Setti, an obscure and provincial artist, and reflects his familiarity with the Mannerist artistic vocabulary prevalent in the Counter-Reformation era.</p>\n",
