These leaves (1938.86.27 and 1938.88.52) were removed from their original texts in the early twentieth century and grouped into portfolios celebrating fifteenth and sixteenth-century book illustrations. Yet the <em>Saint Otilia</em> bears an early owner\u2019s mark from her previous life, and this viewer or another early user has augmented the saint\u2019s halo; the border of the altar showing Christ\u2019s Resurrection; and the muscles on the soul escaping the mouth of hell in Otilia\u2019s vision. In contrast, Jost Amman\u2019s book boasted many woodcuts with spaces intentionally left blank for viewers to complete with their personal coats of arms, an option not realized on this particular sheet.</p>\n",
