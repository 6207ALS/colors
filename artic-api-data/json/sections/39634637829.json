There the work was entitled Woman Stooping (Femme accroupie); when it was sent to the Art Institute, it was called Tahitian Woman, where, upon accessioning, its title was changed to Tahitian Child.\n\nIndeed, a child, sitting with his or her hands on raised knees and eyes closed, is depicted encased in a roughly cut, womb-like shape. Gauguin executed this image primarily in watercolor, but the blue outlines of the figure seem to have been made through a monotype transfer, suggesting depth and adding to the mysterious character of the image. Gauguin apparently cut the vignette from a larger sheet and mounted it.\n\nGauguin\u2019s relationship to children was ambivalent at best. He fathered a number of them: five with his Danish wife, Mette, and several with mistresses in Tahiti. But he abandoned his European family for the sake of his art, and only one of his Tahitian children seems to have survived into adulthood (born on April 19, 1899, \u00c9mile Marea a Tai Gauguin was an infant when his father left him and his mother to live in the Marquesas). Peter Zegers suggests that the infant in the late wood-block print Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love and You Will be Happy) of 1899 (fig. 129.2 [cat. 105]) is \u00c9mile. Whether or not the Art Institute\u2019s work represents this child (who seems older) cannot be determined with certainty. Despite his behavior toward his own offspring, the artist was drawn to the young because he believed that they experience the world in a purer state than adults who have been stifled by the constraints of \u201ccivilization.\u201d In works such as the present sheet, he showed a sensitivity and tenderness that can be found in many of his depictions of children.\n\nIn its emphatically in utero silhouette, Seated Tahitian Child resembles similar fragments that Gauguin cut from works or drew in various media and pasted into albums, such as illustrations for Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (see fig. 129.3). While there is no way to determine the original context from which the seated child came, the egg-like form that contains the figure suggests a womb that shelters the dreaming embryo until it is ready to issue forth and begin the next chapter of its life.\n\nBelinda Thomson suggested that the Art Institute\u2019s watercolor relates to the depiction of a child seated on the ground eating an apple in the 1896 canvas Nave nave mahana (Delightful Days) (W 548) (fig. 129.4). While this figure is depicted in a side view, the positions of its arms and legs are entirely different. Thomson dated the Art Institute\u2019s work to 1890/1903; a more precise date cannot be ascertained.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio (1868\u20131940), Paris, between 1893 and 1895.\n\nEmily Crane Chadbourne (1871\u20131964), London and Chicago, by 1910.\n\nGiven by Emily Crane Chadbourne to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, no cat. no.\n\nNew York, 69th Regiment Armory, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Feb. 17\u2013Mar. 15, 1913, cat. 178, as Femme Accroupie.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Mar. 24\u2013Apr. 16, 1913, cat. 141, as Woman stooping.

See Anna Gruetzner Robins, \u201c\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d Burlington Magazine 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), p. 788.\n\nPeter Zegers referred to the work as Seated Tahitian Youth, a title used by Anna Gruetzner Robins in \u201c\u2019Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d in Burlington Magazine 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), p. 788; and Belinda Thomson, in Gauguin: Maker of Myth, ed. Belinda Thomson, exh. cat. (Tate Publishing, 2010), p. 210, fig. 140. The figure is surely that of a child, but he or she is seated, hence the title assigned to the composition in the present publication.\n\nThere is evidence that the sheet was removed from another mount before being laid down on its current secondary support, which is clearly more modern.\n\nTehura, Gauguin\u2019s mistress during his first Tahitian sojourn, apparently became pregnant, but Gauguin left Tahiti for Europe either before the birth or shortly after, and there is no documentation of the existence of this child. In late 1896, his mistress, Pahura, or Pau\u2019ura, gave birth to a girl, who died after several days. See David Sweetman, Paul Gauguin: A Life (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1995), pp. 339, 438. My thanks to Suzy Ford for her study of Gauguin as a father.\n\nSee Belinda Thomson, ed., Gauguin: Maker of Myth, exh. cat. (Tate Publishing, 2010), pp. 205, 210\u201311, cats. 140, 142.\n\nSee Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat. (Museo de Bellas Artes de Bilbao, 2013), pp. 195\u201398, 208, no. 3. Gauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. According Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists,theyreason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value because Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.\n\nAccording to Anna Gruetzner Robins, Emily Crane Chadbourne lent the drawing to the 1910 exhibition at Grafton Galleries in London. See \u2018\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u2019 Burlington Magazine 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), p. 788.\n\nIn her article \u201c\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d Anna Gruetzner Robins notes that Emily Crane Chadbourne\u2019s Gauguin works were in the Grafton Gallery show, but only one can be assigned a specific catalogue number (cat. 64). Robins mentions that six (five works on paper, one is a drawing on the verso and counted as the sixth, see cat. 45, cat. 61, cat. 64, and cat. 126) works by Chadbourne were given to the Art Institute, and these works were certainly in the Grafton Galleries show by deduction: \u201cIn 1913 she lent four of these six works by Gauguin to the Armory Show, which suggests that all the Chadbourne Gauguins now in Chicago were in the Grafton Galleries exhibition.\u201d Anna Gruetzner Robins, \u201c\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d Burlington Magazine 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), p. 788.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 129 Seated Tahitian Youth, 1894/1903.\n\nfig. 129.1 Installation of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian Youth (1984/1903), bottom row far right, in International Exhibition of Modern Art, Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 24\u2013Apr. 16, 1913.
