    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This splendid greenhouse may look of a Raj\u2019s palace in India but it was actually built in Germany for King Wilhelm III. Notice the four women in Eastern dress lounging around the base of the center column.  Gloria Groom is curator of European painting.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: It\u2019s this mixture of reality with fantasy. These women are probably inspired by an Indian play that had been performed in 1821 at court. The architecture itself evokes Indian temples. So you have this wonderful sense of being there with this real garden and these theatrical figures who kind of evoke harem women, enslaved concubines.<br>Narrator:  Painter Carl Blechen had never traveled outside of Europe but his background in the theater and his imagination of the exotic East combined to create this staged oriental fantasy. Now, look above the women and notice the sky silhouettes of palm fronds looming in the foreground. Again, Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: What I love most about it is that you have these great palm trees which, of course, would not grow naturally in Germany. And I\u2019m sure for the Germans in nineteenth century it was astonishing to see these kinds of plants on their own terrain.</p>\n",
