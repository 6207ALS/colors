Audio description tour introduction and device instructions.</p>\n<p>This tour describes works of art for people with low or no vision.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, let\u2019s take a moment to explain how to use this device. We will then explain how this audio program will unfold.</p>\n<p>Artworks on this tour are indicated by an \u2018AD\u2019 symbol and a three digit number located on the label to the left or right of the artworks.</p>\n<p>The buttons on your Acoustiguide device are divided into two sections\u2014an upper and lower section. You will use the lower section. The lower section is laid out like a telephone keypad, with raised dots on the number 'five' button. To access any stop on the tour, just enter the number and press the 'play' button, which is located directly above the number \u20181\u2019 button. You can press this button again to pause a selection at any time. To cancel a selection, press the \u2018stop\u2019 button, which is located directly above the number \u20183\u2019 button. Then enter a new number, and press the \u2018play\u2019 button. To adjust the volume, use the rocker button on the left side of the device.</p>\n<p>Each stop on the tour will begin with confirmation of the number of that stop. It will also include a reading of the 'object label' information. That will normally consist of the artist's name, if it\u2019s known, the title, date and dimensions of an artwork. A description of the work will follow. At the end of each visual description, you will be prompted to enter a number in order to listen to the interpretive commentary.</p>\n",
