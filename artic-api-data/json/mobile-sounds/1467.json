    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This beautiful slender bronze statue depicts a Hindu goddess possibly Uma.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Uma is an aspect of the goddess as the consort of the god Shiva and one of the most pacific aspects of the goddess. Here you\u2019re seeing the goddess with four arms holding certain attributes including possibly a mirror in one of her hands and a lotus bud. The mirror and the lotus show her in her more female aspects.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The bronze was made in a region that is now part of Vietnam. In the ninth and tenth centuries Indic religions were introduced there by merchant traders stopping along a shipping route between India and China. New religions were embraced and reinterpreted in the local style.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Vietnam, particularly southern Vietnam had a culture that was quite Indic in its influence. And many Indian gods both Hindu and Buddhists were popular in the Cham regions of Vietnam. And so it\u2019s not surprising to find images of this goddess. But what you are seeing is a goddess that shows the local Dong Duong style of the Cham kingdom.  Notice the facial features of this female figurine, particularly the full lips, the broad, rather flat nostrils and the beautifully arched joined eyebrows.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Uma\u2019s long tightly wrapped sarong or skirt with its intricately carved floral front panel is also typical of the Dong Duong style. Originally, the figure was decorated with a gemstone in her forehead and detachable earrings, now lost. The striking jade colored patina on this bronze statue developed over many centuries.</p>\n",
