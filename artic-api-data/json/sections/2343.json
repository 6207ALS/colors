By the second quarter of the seventeenth century, these extravagant objects had been superseded in England by sets of smaller, dome- or capstan-shaped trencher salts, which were placed around the table for the convenience of diners. Small, circular salt dishes with three feet became standard in England and its colonies during the second quarter of the eighteenth century; a pair of this type in the Art Institute\u2019s collection is marked by Thomas Shields. The cast shells and gadrooned (or fluted) borders seen on this pair appeared in America with the emergence of the Rococo style in this country; in 1763 Philadelphia silversmith Edmund Milne advertised \u201cchased plain and godroon\u2019d nurled salts\u201d that he had imported from London. The oval shape with four feet was less common, although Philadelphia silversmiths Richard Humphreys, John Germon, and the firm of Joseph and Nathaniel Richardson (see cat. 36) marked similar examples. In 1762 Joseph Richardson, Sr., ordered from London four pairs of salt dishes, \u201cGadrooned edge all of a Siz So that any two of them may fellow Each other with Glasses &amp; Shovels.\u201d Makers sometimes fitted such salt dishes with glass liners in order to protect the objects\u2019 surfaces from corrosion. Gilding could also serve as protection; at one time, this technique was applied to the interiors of Shields\u2019s two salt dishes.\n\nShields was born in Newlin Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania. At age seventeen he was apprenticed for four years to Philadelphia silversmith John Bayly, Sr. (see cat. 27), who also may have trained Shields\u2019s younger brother Caleb. In 1765 Shields opened a shop near his former master on Front Street, and for the remainder of his career he operated at different addresses on that street\u2014\u201cat the Golden Cup and Crown,\u201d as his shop sign read. His workforce included several apprentices: Samuel Stout beginning in 1772, Richard Fullerton in 1773, and James Musgrave in 1782. In the 1790 U.S. Census Shields\u2019s household included four white males over age sixteen, three white males under sixteen, three white females, and one other free person. Shields was an active member of the Baptist Church, for which he made communion cups in 1794. Together with his brothers he owned property in Baltimore and in Northampton County, Pennsylvania. He may have retired from silversmithing later in that decade: beginning in 1796, Philadelphia city directories listed his profession as \u201cGentleman.\u201d\n\nA surviving daybook, primarily for the years 1775 to 1777, provides a detailed account of Shields\u2019s career during the first years of the Revolutionary War. Similar to many silversmiths, much of his shop\u2019s activity consisted of repairing and selling gold and silver watches, jewelry, buttons, buckles, and flatware, some of which were fabricated on-site. A significant portion of the business was devoted to making, mounting, and repairing swords and knives and retailing scabbards and sword belts. Shields sold many of these wares as well as silversmiths\u2019 tools to his competitors, including John Bayly, Sr., and Jr.; John David, Sr.; and Abraham Dubois, Sr. The daybook contains no reference to salt dishes, although it does indicate that in February 1776 Shields supplied four salt spoons for \u00a31.1.3 to silversmith George Christopher Dowig, who marked a pair of circular salt dishes with cast ornament similar to Shields\u2019s.\n\nIn the daybook, silver hollowware generated the highest prices but accounted for only a small percentage of Shields\u2019s annual output. Similar to jewelry and other small goods, some of the hollowware Shields retailed was fashioned by other craftsmen. In October 1775 Shields sold Israel Musgrave a \u201cpolished Silver Waiter\u201d for \u00a37; the next entry in the daybook credits \u00a31.10.6 to Daniel Van Voorhis (see cat. 38 and cat. 39) for making the waiter. The following month, Samuel Griffin purchased two quart tankards and two pint tankards for \u00a368.4.0 with an additional \u00a31.14.0 for \u201cengraving 4 Cyphers &amp; 4 crests on the above.\u201d The subsequent entries in the daybook credit \u00a317.0.5 to John Letelier, Sr., for their execution with deductions of \u00a38.4.0 for payments to John Charter \u201cfor polishing Inside of 4 mugs\u201d and Van Voorhis \u201cfor finishing ye above.\u201d Shields recorded a chased milk pot sold in January 1776 as \u201cof British manufacture,\u201d apparently to distinguish it from the more patriotic, locally made products he usually retailed. In July 1777 Shields took the Oath of Allegiance to the newly proclaimed United States.  \nDavid L.
