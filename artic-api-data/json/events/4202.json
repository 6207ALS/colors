    "description": "<p>In addition to reflecting the actualities of the moment in which it was made, art in Europe between 1910 and 1930 often envisioned hypothetical ideals of modernity, not yet achieved. This hour-long tour with Caitlin Haskell, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of International Modern Art, addresses paintings and sculptures that show artists testing out and imagining provisional theories of what modernity could be, as well as artists who retreated from the perceived expectations of being modern by creating equally fictive anti-modern worlds.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p>",
