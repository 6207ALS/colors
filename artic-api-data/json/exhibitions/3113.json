    "short_description": "Collector and scholar of Japanese art Oliver H. Statler was devoted to the advancement of modern Japanese prints at a time when the movement had few advocates, even in Japan. His interest in these works began when he was an army employee stationed in Tokyo during the Japanese occupation after World War II. A large number of the prints featured in this exhibition were published in Statler\u2019s 1956 landmark book Modern Japanese Prints: An Art Reborn, which charted the still-developing sosaku hanga, or creative print, movement.",
