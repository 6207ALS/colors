Donnelley and supplied to him by his teacher, Vera Berdich. He reworked the original plate depicting an old house, which appeared bug-infested, emphasizing the marginal images of insects. Berdich consistently offered Valerio hard but honest criticism, which kept him interested in returning to her class. In addition, later in life, she continued to provide verbal support and encouragement for his art.</p>\n",
