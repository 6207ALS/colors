The exhibition attracted many visitors and renewed enthusiasm for the artist\u2019s work. Among his admirers was Chicago businessman and art collector Clement C. Caditz, who, spurred by the exhibition, purchased a number of prints. What he truly desired, however, was a unique artwork, though he believed this to be beyond his means. Boldly, he decided to write to Matisse and request a drawing for the modest sum of fifty to one hundred dollars. In August, the artist obliged, but stated that it was an exception; \u201cPlease do not encourage your friends to make me a similar request,\u201d he implored. Matisse\u2019s generosity was trumpeted a month later in Time magazine (fig. 56.1) after Caditz shared his story with Chicago-based photographer and correspondent Arthur Siegel.\n\nThe untitled drawing, now in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago, was one Matisse made in May 1947 while living in Vence. It is a portrait of a young woman created with pen and black ink and with no underdrawing. With an experienced hand and light touch, Matisse cleanly rendered her sparkling eyes, the graceful tilt of her head, and her light, round curls. The lines are minimal, evenly spaced, and show no signs of hesitation. These few deliberate marks enliven the entire sheet in such a way that the white paper appears luminous, adding a discernible weight to the composition.\n\nThe work has similarities to Jackie, a suite of ten drawings of the artist\u2019s granddaughter Jacqueline Matisse, also made in Vence in 1947. The girls appear to be about the same age and the style of their pen-and-ink portraits is comparable. Confidently executed on the sheet with equally weighted lines, each work embodies the unique character of the model with just a few abbreviated marks. In the Jackie suite, essential elements that define the sitter\u2019s persona, such as short hair, a pointed collar, and a small thin nose, are repeated from one drawing to the next with subtle differences. For Matisse, part of the importance of working in a series was the cinematic effect of capturing the passage of time (see cat. 48 and cat. 49 for a discussion of Matisse\u2019s themed suites). In Jackie V (1947; fig. 56.2) for example, the sitter looks right, and in Jackie VII (1947; fig. 56.3), she looks left, chin resting on her fist. The Art Institute\u2019s drawing is likely one of several sheets depicting a curly-haired young woman with a collared shirt, which may have been why Matisse agreed to Caditz\u2019s request. In another pen-and-ink drawing from the series (1947; fig. 56.4), also made in May and on the same size of sheet, the sitter slouches slightly to the left, her cheeks and jaw widened due to the shifted perspective, but in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, the young girl sits upright, elongating her neck. Matisse\u2019s clear observations of his subject are recorded with a resolute pen that captures the girl\u2019s distinct visage and pleasant demeanor.  \nDebora Wood\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew the portrait directly with a metal-nibbed dip pen and black ink, with no preliminary sketch. The smooth, well-sized, cream wove paper is well suited to pen-and-ink drawing, allowing for uninterrupted fluid lines. There is a faint fine line in the hair at upper left, which is a stray pen-and-ink mark.\n\nSigned and dated: H. Matisse Mai 47 (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 56.5).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. Under microscope examination at 200\u00d7 the ink appears semitranslucent with a warm, almost brown hue though it appears black to the naked eye. Black pigment particles suspended in the translucent ink are evident. Under ultraviolet light (254 nm) the ink appears very brown. There is no fluorescence evident on the recto or verso (fig. 56.6) under 254 or 365 nm. The ink used differs markedly from the glossy, black ink employed in other drawings.\n\nThe support is medium thick, smooth, cream wove paper. The fiber matrix contains occasional inclusions and colored fibers visible at 2\u00d7. Transmitted light shows a fine screen pattern. The top edge was unevenly trimmed. All other edges appear hand torn.\n\n40.2 \u00d7 26.2 cm (15 3/4 \u00d7 10 3/8 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2002. At that time a strip of brown Kraft paper tape was removed from the center of the top edge on the verso. Yellow stains left by tape adhesive at the four corners were reduced. The drawing was humidified and flattened to reduce dents and planar distortions.\n\nThere are yellow adhesive stains remaining at the four corners. There are other yellow stains along the lower edge and one at the left edge, above center. The top edge was unevenly and jaggedly trimmed. The interior of the sheet has darkened slightly while the edges retain a whiter hue where they were protected from light exposure.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Given by the artist to Clement C.

The Matisse retrospective was curated by Alfred H. Barr and opened at the Museum of Modern Art, New York (Nov. 13, 1951\u2013Jan. 13, 1952). It subsequently traveled to the Cleveland Museum of Art (Feb. 5\u2013Mar. 16, 1952); the Art Institute of Chicago (Apr. 1\u2013May 4, 1952); and the San Francisco Museum of Art (May 22\u2013July 6, 1952). The exhibition was accompanied by a major publication, Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Matisse: His Art and His Public, which is still considered an essential study of the artist.\n\nIn the early 1950s, Matisse prints could be purchased for as little as ten dollars, but monumental print projects such as Jazz (1947; see number 8 in Book Checklist) and Floril\u00e8ge des amours de Ronsard (1948; see number 9 in Book Checklist) would have been outside what Caditz was willing to spend. Upon their release, Jazz sold for $375 and the deluxe edition of Ronsard sold for $500.\n\nIn a letter to Clement Caditz, Henri Matisse wrote: \u201cMais je vous prie de bien vouloir ne pas encourager quelq\u2019un de vos amis \u00e0 me faire une demande similaire car j\u2019ai accept\u00e9 votre proposition tout-\u00e0-fait exceptionnellement\u201d (But I beg you please do not encourage your friends to make me a similar request for I accept your proposal quite exceptionally).

While the circumstances of the purchase and subsequent publicity are not entirely documented, it is likely that the story of Caditz\u2019s acquisition circulated through his circle of industrial and metal fabrication business associates. Caditz owned Northern Metal Projects and had founded an international trade association for the metal stamping industry. Siegal was a photojournalist and commercial photographer who received many commissions from the metal industry and contributed images and writings to magazines such as Time, Life, and Fortune.\n\nThe first drawing was made in charcoal to establish the subject of the suite; it was followed by nine drawings in pen and black ink. All ten are reproduced in John Elderfield, The Drawings of Henri Matisse, exh. cat. (Arts Council of Great Britain/Museum of Modern Art, New York/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1984), pp. 228\u201331, 277\u201378.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s drawing is inscribed \"B 1\" and T\u00eate de jeune fille is inscribed \u201cB 3.\u201d The inscriptions indicate that these works are part of a series of variations on a theme: \u201cB\u201d is the theme, and \u201c1\u201d and \u201c3\u201d are the drawings\u2019 numbers within that theme.\n\nThis ink is similar to that used in another pen-and-ink drawing in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection, Woman Seated at a Table with Fruit and Pitcher (July 1944; cat. 54).\n\nDescriptions of paper thickness and texture follow the standard set forth in Elizabeth Lunning and Roy Perkinson, The Print Council of America Paper Sample Book: A Practical Guide to the Description of Paper (Print Council of America/Sun Hill, 1996).\n\nMargo Rachel McFarland, conservation note, Apr. 17, 2002, object database, Art Institute of Chicago. Treatment slides are in the conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAccording to the inscription by Henri Matisse and a letter from Matisse to Clement C. Caditz dated August 14, 1952, the artist gave this drawing to Clement at the collector\u2019s request; photocopy of letter in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDeed of Gift signed and dated by Clement C. Caditz, Aug. 14, 2001; Committee to Accept Year-End Gifts meeting minutes, Dec. 27, 2001, p. 11; photocopies in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. The drawing was already in process as a gift on the date of Mr. Caditz\u2019s death on December 15, 2001, although it was not officially accepted into the Art Institute\u2019s collection until the meeting of the Committee to Accept Year-End Gifts on December 27, 2001.\n\n\u201cPh\u201d is an abbreviation for \u201cphoto,\u201d indicating that the drawing was photographed.
