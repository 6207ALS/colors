    "description": "<p>This installation aims to unravel the myth of Mies van der Rohe as a solitary genius. Fundaci\u00f3 Mies commissioned Andr\u00e9s Jaque in 2012 to create a site-specific intervention in Mies\u2019s most famous building, the Barcelona Pavilion. The original Pavilion of 1929 was reconstructed in 1986 with the fundamental addition of a basement. Jaque\u2019s installation focused on this lower level, which was an overlooked yet significant part of the building, introducing new questions for contemporary scholarship about Mies. The intervention exposes\u2014like the phantom of the Pavilion\u2019s past\u2014the building\u2019s hidden context: the networks of people, technologies, and institutions that made it possible. <em>PHANTOM. Mies as Rendered Society</em> consists of all the objects and materials found in the basement that have contributed to rebuilding and maintaining Mies\u2019s iconic building and reputation. This installation includes architectural fragments such as the velvet curtains, travertine plates, a spare Barcelona chair now broken, as well as contemporary cleaning products and devices that support the Pavilion\u2019s maintenance. Together these objects reveal the Barcelona Pavilion as a social construction resulting from specific technological moments and civic initiatives.</p>\n",
