    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Jack Puzzle is made up of six different notched brass bars that interlock in one specific way to create a unified \"jack\" shape. It is exactingly milled, and weighs just over one pound. A desk object, a paperweight, and a true distraction \u2014 but be warned, if you take it apart, you might not be able to figure out how to put it back together. Includes assembly instructions.</span></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Dimensions:<span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</span></strong>3 x 3 x 3 in.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">1.1 lbs</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Solid brass, .5 in diameter rods, bull-nose ends, lathe-cut</span></li>\n</ul>",
