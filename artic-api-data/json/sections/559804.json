Their meeting sparked more than a decade of professional collaboration that included side-by-side working sessions and camaraderie in both public and private settings. As a result of such communal creativity, Whistler, Roussel, and their artistic circle made remarkable technical and aesthetic developments in lithography and color etching.\n\nWhile museums including the Art Institute of Chicago have long celebrated Whistler\u2019s many-faceted career, much less attention has been given to Roussel and indeed to the larger community of artists and models with whom both Roussel and Whistler worked. This exhibition considers the nature of collaboration in late nineteenth-century London through the lens of the intertwining lives and creative projects of these two artists.\n\nAs part of the larger etching revival, which promoted a reconsideration of etching as a form of fine art, Whistler implemented a number of technical strategies to enhance the unique status of individual impressions of his prints. These included developing a final image through a progressive series of states; selectively wiping the plate prior to printing an impression; and trimming intaglio prints to their plate marks to call the viewer\u2019s attention to the art works rather than the margins around them (leaving only a tab for the artist\u2019s signature). Roussel adopted all of these practices, and a number of his intaglio prints demonstrate his familiarity with Whistler\u2019s methods while others show his separate exploration of tonal techniques like aquatint and softground.\n\nIn transfer lithography, the artist creates a design in lithographic crayon on specially coated paper instead of directly on the lithographic stone. The drawing is then transferred to the stone, and as a result, the artist can maintain the spontaneity of the original in the realized print. Whistler introduced Roussel to transfer lithography, and a selection of their finished work as well as several surviving untransferred drawings are on display here.\n\nTo create color effects in their printing, Roussel and Whistler explored different technical approaches. Color could be introduced through multiple printing matrices (one lithographic stone for each color present, as in Whistler\u2019s Yellow House) or through direct application of colored inks to a single etching plate (as in Roussel\u2019s Sea at Bognor). Both artists gave careful consideration to their ink colors, experimenting with different formulae and combinations in numerous trial proofs. Roussel carried his investigations further, developing an innovative technique using textile plates and stencils (as exemplified by L\u2019oubli\u00e9).\n\nWhistler, who first created frame designs for his paintings, developed distinctive white frames with linear decoration for his etchings and lithographs. Clearly influenced by the older artist, Roussel conceived more elaborate schemes in which he affixed etched designs to frame moldings. This approach to framing his prints extended beyond the decoration of the frame itself to include printed mounts, which served as backdrops for his color prints. The resulting ensembles incorporated printed elements in every component\u2014art object, mount, and frame.\n\nBorn in France, Theodore Roussel relocated to England in the 1870s, where he participated in the fields of painting and the graphic arts. As the works on display amply demonstrate, Roussel invested considerable artistic energy in an exploration of the technical capabilities of printmaking, pushing the limits of visual expression through manipulations of intaglio processes, experimental color printing, and frame design. While a participant in the social and intellectual circles of late nineteenth-century London, Roussel was fundamentally an introspective figure, preferring sustained and solitary explorations to the cultivation of a public persona. His elegant and thoughtful work, therefore, is still gaining recognition and acclaim.\n\nIn addition to portraying members of their own families, Whistler and Roussel also employed professional models. Another point of connection between these two artists\u2014as well as their peers\u2014is their affiliation with some of the same models, whose likenesses are displayed in this group of works.\n\nLondon of the late nineteenth century was a city dense with private clubs of many different stripes. These clubs, as well as restaurants and various exhibiting societies, provided artists with many venues for social interaction. As someone who avoided dining alone, Whistler frequented the various clubs to which he belonged. Roussel was a member of some of the same institutions, as were a great many of their literary and artistic colleagues. These were spaces where intellectual questions could be posed and creative problems could be solved\u2014not entirely in spite of dinner also being served.\n\nThe working relationship that Whistler and Roussel maintained for over a decade serves as one example of the artistic collaboration that characterized creative life in late nineteenth-century London and Paris. The works in this gallery reflect the reach of the artistic communities to which both artists belonged before and after the time of their mutual acquaintance. The overlapping interests in similar subjects and similar technical experimental evident in these objects manifest the active circulation of ideas among these creative peers.\n\nFrom November 1898 through February 1899, the South Kensington Museum (now called the Victoria and Albert Museum) mounted an exhibition devoted to the art of lithography to celebrate the centenary of the technique\u2019s invention. This monumental project, which included over 2,000 lithographs, reflected the widespread artistic enthusiasm for this technique as an expressive medium. Alongside many friends and contemporaries, Whistler and Roussel both participated in this exhibition.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Frank Duveneck, a group of American students traveled in 1880 from Munich to Venice to continue their artistic training. Shortly after their arrival, they encountered Whistler, who was there to create his now famous series of Venice etchings. Duveneck, his students, and the more renowned Whistler soon joined forces, residing in the same location, sharing printmaking equipment and materials, and exchanging ideas about subject matter and specific printing techniques such as the selective wiping of their copper printing plates.\n\nBeyond his prolific work as a painter, printmaker, draftsman, and interior designer, Whistler attained celebrity status through his mannered style of self-presentation and lust for media attention. His contemporaries responded by creating scores of portraits, some reverent and others within the caricature tradition. As early as 1918, only fifteen years after Whistler\u2019s death, a scholarly study was published that listed over 260 known portraits of Whistler. This gallery contains a sample of those works.\n\nA selection of letters, books, and pamphlets are included in the exhibition. In particular, examples of the correspondence between Whistler and Roussel convey the tenor of their relationship through everyday messages about meeting times and places and more personal expressions of artistic connection and condolence.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\"> 1.1 James McNeill Whistler (American, 1834\u20131903).
