    "description": "<p>Join Adele Nelson, assistant professor in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of Texas at Austin, for a discussion of the artist Lygia Pape (1927\u20132004) .</p><p>Following World War II, media and art institutions in industrializing nations like Brazil treated women artists as the faces of an expanding commercial culture. It was in this context that Lygia Pape expanded and subverted these expectations with her production of single edition woodcut prints that refused mass production. Pape plumbed the capacities of printmaking to create visual spaces of intersection and contrast in which sight and touch, word and image, and woman and worker form unexpected and unprecedented relationships.</p><p><em>Support for this program is provided by the Allan McNab Endowed Fund.</em></p><h2>About the Speaker </h2><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
