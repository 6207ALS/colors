    "description": "<p>Zarina Bhimji\u2019s Out of Blue captures nuanced impressions of presentday Uganda, where the artist lived as a child. For Bhimji, however, the film transcends biographical concerns. She explained, &quot;The work is not a personal indulgence; it is about making sense through the medium of aesthetics.&quot; In the opening scene, a crackle of flames erupts into an allencompassing fire that overtakes an expansive, verdant landscape. This destructive, yet mesmerizing blaze acts as a dynamic formal element that sets the tone of the film. Intermingled with sweeping views of a picturesque countryside are lingering shots of empty locations imbued with memory and loss\u2014disused refugee dwellings, cemeteries, prison cells, and schoolyards\u2014evoking both British colonial rule and the repressive military dictatorship of Idi Amin, during which thousands of Asians were expelled from the country. Matching the intense visual detail of the film is the artist\u2019s richly layered soundtrack, in which ambient sounds from nature\u2014mosquitoes buzzing, bird wings flapping\u2014are punctuated with distant gunshots, chaotic voices, excerpts from General Amin\u2019s radio announcements, and a woman\u2019s sobs. Viewed as an open-ended, aesthetic engagement with the processes of looking and understanding, <em>Out of Blue</em> is neither memoir nor protest. According to Bhimji, &quot;My work is about learning to listen to difference in its various forms. . . . It is not about capturing an existing thing; it is about creating a new one.&quot;</p>\n",
