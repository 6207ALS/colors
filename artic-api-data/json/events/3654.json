    "description": "<p>><strong>This program is SOLD OUT. A standby line will start at 9:00 for tickets that become available.</strong> </p><p>>Join Kid Koala's turntable orchestra with this interactive live performance. Kid Koala presents an innovative collection of dreamy, atmospheric tracks composed especially for this event. In this latest live experience, audience members are seated at stations equipped with a turntable, effects box, and a small crate of color-coded vinyl records. Through subtle colored lighting changes, the audience is cued to play along. An integral part of the show, the audience accompanies Kid Koala to create an \u201cambient vinyl orchestra,\u201d melding individual strains into a fluid body of sound. The idea is to have 60 harmonized turntables create a unique, uplifting, dynamic evening of light and music.</p><p>>Presented with the Empty Bottle </p><p>>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman\u2019s Board of the Art Institute of Chicago </p><p> class=\"standard-sand\"><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p>>Eric San, also known as <strong>Kid Koala</strong>, is a world-renowned scratch DJ, music producer, and award-winning graphic novelist.
