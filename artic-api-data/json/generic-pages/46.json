Finding Aid   New Art Examiner Records [U] The New Art Examiner was a Chicago-based art magazine founded in 1973 by Jane Addams Allen and Derek Guthrie. The focus of the magazine began in Chicago and included smaller, regional art centers in Illinois, gradually expanding and developing its coverage throughout the Midwest and eventually nationally and internationally. The magazine's mission was \"to examine the definition and transmission of culture in our society; the decision-making processes within museums, schools, and the agencies of patronage which determine the manner in which culture shall be transmitted; the value systems which presently influence the making of art as well as its study in exhibitions and books; and, in particular, the interaction of these factors within the visual arts milieu.\" New Art Examiner ceased publication with its May/June 2002 issue.   New Bauhaus/Institute of Design Interviews (Moholy-Nagy Foundation) [P] The Institute of Design (ID) began as an outpost of experimental Bauhaus education in Chicago and became one of the most important schools of photography in 20th-century America. In its iterations as the New Bauhaus (1937\u201338), School of Design in Chicago (1939\u20131944) and finally the Institute of Design (beginning in 1944), the school fostered exploration and innovation. Its faculty included such luminaries as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Harry Callahan, and Aaron Siskind, who in turn attracted students who would become some of the nation's finest artists, designers, and photographers. The photographic work produced by teachers and students at the ID set new standards for picture-making, and the school\u2019s pedagogy has been disseminated internationally by generations of photographer-teachers. In preparation for the exhibition Taken by Design: Photographs from the Institute of Design, 1937\u20131971 (David Travis and Elizabeth Siegel, the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002), numerous telephone and in-person interviews were conducted with teachers and students from the school. These recollections provide insight into teaching methods, the unusual pedagogy of the school across its iterations, details of student life, and the camaraderie and mutual support felt by the students at this exciting place and time. The transcription of these interviews has been made possible by a generous grant from the Moholy-Nagy Foundation. Scholars may submit a request to hear audio recordings at rbarchives@artic.edu.

Bernstein's aim was \"to make available to the public a whole era's worth of good and valuable art that for a long time [was] inaccessible, not so much lost as unidentified.\" Bernstein sought works created not only through the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, but also those sponsored or funded by lesser known New Deal art programs such the PWAP (Public Works of Art Program), the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture (later, Treasury Section of Fine Arts), and The Treasury Relief Art Project. The scope of Bernstein's research encompassed only surviving, large-scale works of New Deal art in public places in Illinois, including those found de-installed but in storage.

While originally inviting oil painting, watercolors, prints, sculpture, and ceramics, by the second year exhibit organizers limited entries to oil painting, watercolors, and prints, though in 1950 drawings were also included.

Finding Aid View selected images from this collection   Percier & Fontaine Collection, about 1790\u20131872 2 linear feet [P] French architects Charles Percier (1764\u20131838) and Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Leonard Fontaine (1762\u20131853) are widely credited with the development of the neo-classical Empire style. Appointed architectes du gouvernement by Napoleon in 1801, their architecture and interior design work can be found in many of the monuments of Napoleonic Paris. Percier and Fontaine also authored numerous books on architecture and design throughout their partnership. The Art Institute of Chicago purchased Fontaine's library in 1927, which included original architectural drawings and prints that are now held in the Ryerson and Burnham Archives. The early drawings are primarily by Fontaine's nephew, Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Louis Fontaine, and include examples of his architectural work at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris and his studies of classical antiquities in Italy and Greece. The later drawings reflect both Fontaines' work in reshaping Paris under Napoleon III and the younger Fontaine's own architectural work throughout France. Only a few examples of Percier's original drawings are included in the collection. The prints are primarily published plates of classical and renaissance architecture in Italy and annotated studies of the redevelopment of Paris under Napoleon III. The purchase also included more than two hundred books and published portfolios documenting Percier and Fontaine's architectural work, their interest in antiquities and historical design styles, and the rebuilding of Paris under Napoleon III. The books are held in the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries. Finding Aid View selected images from this collection Detailed Collection Description   Jessie M.

Finding Aid   Mary Reynolds Collection 2 linear feet [P] Mary Reynolds (1891\u20131950), an American expatriate in pre-World War II Paris, befriended and supported many contemporary artists, including Marcel Duchamp, Jean Cocteau, Raymond Queneau, Max Ernst, and Man Ray.

Finding Aid   Georges Rouault Collection, 1946-1972 .5 linear foot [P] Strongly influenced by the biblical iconography and aesthetics of medieval stained glass, French artist Georges Rouault's work attracted the attention of Chicago Roman Catholic priest Father Richard J.
