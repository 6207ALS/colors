    "description": "<p>Grcic\u2019s admiration for efficiently executed designs was the stimulus for the Myto Chair. Named after the Mito motorbike, made by the Italian company Cagiva in the late 1980s, this cantilevered chair has a feisty demeanor, testing the boundaries of industrial production in the field of furniture design. The first all plastic cantilevered chair to be designed since Verner Panton\u2019s 1960s version, it was born out of a collaboration with the German chemical company BASF, which was looking for a way to illustrate the potential of the high-tech plastic Ultradur\u00ae High Speed beyond its use in engines and circuit boards. Italian furniture manufacturer Plank joined forces with BASF to produce and distribute the Myto Chair. The distinctive profile of the chair and the integrated latticework of the surface of the seat and backrest were made possible by the behavioral properties of the plastic, which also allowed for the strong, comfortable, light, and stackable nature of the piece.</p>\n",
