    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The painter Frank Weston Benson is best known for paintings of women and children relaxing in bright landscapes, or looking out to sea from breezy hilltops. His models were usually his own family, especially his three daughters Eleanor, Betty and Sylvia. Here, Benson has shown Betty indoors on a rainy afternoon. She sits apparently lost in thought, her book temporarily abandoned as she gazes toward the fireplace. Benson carefully arranged his pictures, and then posed his daughters in the scenes, a task they seem to have accepted with good humor. Like his sunlit exteriors, this work owes much to the French impressionists in its application of paint and blending of colors. We can see evidence of Benson's admiration for the Dutch master Vermeer. Look at the way the indirect light comes through the window at the rear, and reflects off the polished floor. The Delft pottery jar near the front of the composition is another nod to Vermeer.</p>\n",
