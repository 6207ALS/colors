    "description": "<p>From the moment of his arrival in Paris in 1924, Brassa\u00ef (who took his name from Brasov, his Transylvanian birthplace) was fascinated by the city \u201cunder cover of darkness.\u201d Around 1930, when the former art student learned from his friend Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz that photography at night was indeed possible, he began documenting this extraordinary underworld. The result was his remarkable publication <em>Paris at Night</em> (first published in France in 1933), which depicts not only such well-known spots as the Arc de Triomphe, but also dark streets and alleys with just enough light to reveal a flower-shop window, a pissoir, a show at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re, or the details of wet paving bricks. This image is from a 1932 series taken around Les Halles, in which Brassa\u00ef recorded women he called the \u201cVenuses of the Crossroads,\u201d or prostitutes standing at their posts. With an aura of mystery, Brassa\u00ef captured one of these ladies of the evening as she stood on the puddled street corner, smiling into the shadows.</p>\n",
