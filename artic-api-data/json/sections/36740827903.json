One strains forward, her chest pushed out, hands on hips. Behind, at the far right of the sheet, stand two men. One cups his hands to his mouth as if to shout; the other, more subdued, wears his cap tipped down. They wear smocks rather than jackets, perhaps just having left work. A man in a top hat stands before them; he hunches over a newspaper, ignoring their provocations. At the far left of the composition a family, presumably mother, father, and son, is distanced spatially and socially from the band of young women.\n\nTo read this image as a narrative is entirely appropriate. It illustrates a scene from \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s L\u2019assommoir, an expos\u00e9 about hard drinking and its social consequences that caused something of a scandal in the late 1870s. The seventh in Zola\u2019s series chronicling the Rougon-Macquart family, the story revolves around the laundress Gervaise. Her headstrong daughter Anna, nicknamed Nana, first appears to the reader toward the close of the book. In this drawing she appears simply as the most prominent of the cavorting adolescents.\n\nAnother drawing by the artist\u2014now in the collection of Jean Bonna\u2014is also clearly associated with L\u2019assommoir. That sheet (fig. 5.1 [Dauberville 677]), a looser, more freely worked study executed in brush and ink, includes Zola\u2019s inscription and even a page number at the bottom: \u201cOff they went, the six of them, taking up the whole width of the road, arm in arm in their light dresses, their hair tied with ribbons.\u201d It seems likely that the Art Institute\u2019s version of the scene was produced in pen and ink because the Bonna drawing, lacking definition, would have been unsuitable for reproduction.\n\nRenoir did not make his illustration for the novel\u2019s debut appearance in print. L\u2019assommoir was serialized in 1876 in the democratic newspaper Le bien publique. In 1877 Georges Charpentier published it in full; its popularity soon necessitated reprints. Like Zola, Renoir found a supporter in Charpentier, and in the same year that he made the book illustrations, he painted the publisher\u2019s wife (fig. 5.2 [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]). The Art Institute\u2019s work was commissioned by Charles Marpon and Ernest Flammarion for a deluxe edition of the novel published in 1878. They requested contributions from ten artists, including Henri Gervex, Andr\u00e9 Gill, Georges Clairin, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric R\u00e9gamey. Renoir\u2019s four contributions differed markedly from the others, which focused on the violence and unpleasantness of the novel. The sympathetic appearance of the present scene is in evident contrast to such images as Gill\u2019s Fight between Gervaise and Virginie, in which the two characters attack one another ferociously, their bare legs and arms on show.\n\nIn its multifigure composition and rich detail, Workers on the Outer Boulevard is the most elaborate of Renoir\u2019s efforts for L\u2019assommoir. Whether by design or coincidence, the subject of the passage was well suited to the artist\u2019s flair for the sensual. The section in which the drawing appears tells of the fifteen-year-old Nana\u2019s precocious beauty\u2014\u201cfully developed and no corset, with a real magpie face, milky complexion and skin as velvety as a peach.\u201d Zola explains that Nana and her friends were born and raised on the streets\u2014and, consequently, assumed ownership thereof\u2014but Renoir subdues the vulgarity of the laughing, shouting characters even while depicting their exuberance. In the drawing, Nana is the third figure from the left among the group of girls. In a sheet in which the surface is mostly covered with a network of fine, closely spaced lines, Renoir\u2019s relatively sparse use of media in her description makes her appear all the more vivid. An absence of ink creates an effect of falling light, which accentuates her bust and skirt, drawing attention to her curves. The artist emphasizes the attractiveness of the young women, perhaps mindful of Zola\u2019s description of them \u201cbursting their bodices by displaying their swelling forms.\u201d Nana excited \u201cobvious admiration\u201d; an admiration, perhaps, that Renoir encouraged the viewer to ape.\n\nThere may have been no agenda behind the artist\u2019s focus on the positive aspects of the text, but his dissatisfaction with Zola\u2019s vision of the working classes may have informed his choice. Some years later, in conversation with the dealer Ambroise Vollard, Renoir recounted how he had frequented the salon of Madame Charpentier with Zola and others in the 1870s. Zola\u2019s novel L\u2019oeuvre (The Masterpiece), which depicts the life of a failed artist, had been the cause of many arguments in such circles, Renoir admitted, but his annoyance went beyond that infamous case. \u201cI\u2019ve always hated what he [Zola] writes,\u201d he related. \u201cWhen you want to paint an environment, you should start, so it seems to me, by putting yourself in your characters\u2019 shoes. Zola, he is happy to open a little window, have a quick look outside, and assume that he has painted the people by saying that they smell bad.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being an unabashed sensualist, Renoir had a well-documented preference for uneducated women. Finding lack of sophistication a virtue, it is likely that he delighted in\u2014rather than disapproved of\u2014the type of girl that Zola found crude. It is clear that in major works of this era, including Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (fig. 5.3 [Daulte 209; Dauberville 211]), shown in the third Impressionist exhibition of 1877, Renoir portrayed women of Nana\u2019s class in a sympathetic light. And in 1898, as the art historian Colin Bailey has noted, Julie Manet recorded that Renoir viewed Montmartre families as sensitive souls, in marked contrast to Zola\u2019s description of them as \u201catrocious beings.\u201d\n\nA painting of a laundress in the collection of the Art Institute (fig. 5.4 [cat. 6]) [Daulte 348; Dauberville 382]) also relates to L\u2019assomoir and, once more, appears rather picturesque, given the novel\u2019s general tone. Ostensibly it shows a washerwoman taking a moment\u2019s pause. Renoir also revisited the theme some years later, in Washerwomen (fig. 5.5 [Dauberville 948]) and in a lightly drawn study, Laundress (1885\u201389; Courtauld Gallery, London); but these quasi-pastoral images are far removed from the celebration of youthful idleness that is Workers\u2019 Daughters on the Outer Boulevard.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Workers\u2019 Daughters on the Outer Boulevard (Illustration for \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s \u201cL\u2019assommoir\u201d) is one of three known drawings of the same subject. This work is executed in pen and dark-brown ink on ivory laid paper. Infrared reflectography has captured the faint, slightly smudged underdrawing in black chalk that Renoir used to lay out the composition. The final composition in ink follows the initial chalk underdrawing quite faithfully, providing great detail, as seen in an infrared overlay comparison (fig. 5.6). There are some additional lines at the upper center area, although they do not appear to form discrete elements in the composition (fig. 5.7).\n\nThe brown ink lines are thin and fairly consistent in length and thickness. Crosshatching and closely spaced lines are used to establish shading and modeling, and an absence of line creates areas of highlights (fig. 5.8). The ink lines bleed together in the dog\u2019s spots at the left lower area to form the densest passages in the composition (fig. 5.9). The pen lines are generally oriented vertically or diagonally from the lower left to upper right, as is characteristic of right-handed artists. Changes in the direction of line distinguish the various elements in the composition: for instance, the lines delineating the tree foliage in the upper left corner are oriented diagonally/horizontally, whereas those establishing the background shop walls are straight and vertical. Slight deformations of the paper can be seen in the ink lines due to the pressure of the fine pen nib on the paper.\n\nRenoir (recto, lower left corner, in pen and brown ink) (fig. 5.10).\n\nIvory, medium-thick, slightly textured laid paper.\n\nBFK (for Rives BFK [Blanchet, Freres, &amp; Kiebler]; in shield with two flowers and a crescent above and possibly a golden fleece below, complete, in center of sheet; 14.8 \u00d7 7.5 cm) (fig. 5.11).\n\nHorizontal, 2.7 cm.\n\n7\u20138 per cm.\n\nUniform, without significant inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven, likely machine made.\n\nAll edges appear to have been trimmed and are slightly irregular.\n\n275 \u00d7 399 mm.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a light-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of light gelatin surface sizing; the fluorescence is most pronounced around the perimeter where the window mat protected it from exposure to light.\n\nThe drawing was created in pen and brown ink over traces of black-chalk underdrawing; the ink lines are thin and fairly consistent in length and thickness.\n\nBlack-chalk underdrawing is visible in the overall composition, as it was used initially to establish and define the figures before the drawing was worked out in pen and brown ink (fig. 5.6).\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. There is a light-yellow visible-light fluorescence that suggests the presence of light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThere are numerous losses and skinned areas along the edges on the verso, which may have resulted from the removal of a former edge mounting; the losses are filled. There is also light discoloration and staining from adhesive along the edges, visible on the recto. Soft undulations are visible in the sheet at the sides. There are faint inscriptions or smudges along the bottom edge. A strong vertical crease is visible through the center of the sheet; it is most evident on the verso. Dense areas of ink in the dog at the lower left penetrated through to the verso.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by Maurice Sachs (1906\u20131945), Paris, to De Hauke and Company, Inc., New York, July 1, 1929.\n\nSold by De Hauke and Company, Inc., New York, to John Nicholas Brown II (1900\u20131979), Newport, R.I., Oct. 16, 1929.\n\nEstate of John Nicholas Brown II, Newport, R.I., from 1979.\n\nSold by the estate of John Nicholas Brown II to David Tunick, Incorporated, New York, c. 1986.\n\nSold by David Tunick, Incorporated, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1986.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, De Hauke and Company, Watercolors and Drawings of the 19th and 20th Century, Dec. 1929, no cat.\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island School of Design, Drawings and Paintings from the Collection of Mr. John Nicholas Brown, Apr. 2\u201327, 1931, no. cat.\n\nBuffalo, N.Y., Albright Art Gallery, Master Drawings, Jan. 1935, cat. 122 (ill.).\n\nNew London, Conn., Lyman Allyn Museum, Drawings, Mar. 2\u2013Apr. 15, 1936, cat. 162.\n\nBoston, Museum of Fine Arts, Art in New England, June 8\u2013Sept. 10, 1939, cat. 200 (ill.).\n\nSan Francisco, Calif., Palace of Fine Arts, Master Drawings: An Exhibition of Drawings from American Museums and Private Collections, 1940, pp. 22, 87, cat. 85 (ill.).\n\nOmaha, Neb., Joslyn Art Museum, Dec. 1941.\n\nSan Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, 19th Century French Drawings, Mar. 8\u2013Apr. 6, 1947, p. 64, cat. 105 (ill.).\n\nRotterdam, Boymans Museum, French Drawings in American Collections, 1958, cat. 181, pl. 165; Paris, Mus\u00e9e de Orangerie, 1959; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1959.\n\nNewark, N.J., Newark Museum, Nineteenth Century Master Drawings, Mar. 16\u2013Apr. 30, 1961, cat. 45 (ill.).\n\nCambridge, Mass., Fogg Art Museum, Forty Master Drawings from the Collection of John Nicholas Brown, Summer 1962, cat. 23.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Masterpieces from the Helen Regenstein Collection, 1974\u20131989, Feb. 2\u2013May 8, 1990, no cat.\n\nNew York, Frick Collection, From Pontormo to Seurat: Drawings Recently Acquired by The Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 23\u2013July 7, 1991, cat. 51; Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 10, 1991\u2013Jan. 5, 1992.\n\nVienna, Albertina, Impressionism: Pastels, Watercolors, Drawings, Feb. 9\u2013May 13, 2012, p. 239, cat. 138 (ill.).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Th\u00e9odore Duret, Histoire des peintres impressionistes (H.
