    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is a figure of a seated chieftain, it comes from Vera Cruz along the Gulf Coast of present day Mexico and it was made sometime between the years 300 and 600 AD.  The arts of the ancient civilizations of Mexico and Central America are among the world's finest, especially their achievements in ceramics and stoneware sculpture and this piece is an exceptional example.  The figure sits in a position of authority, an authority that derives from the concentrated tense power of his form, the attributes of his costume and the dignity of his expression.  It's made of fire terracotta clay, the natural color of the clay has dark patched due to uneven firing adding drama to the figure.  Complementing the abstracted simplified body shape are the elegant headdress, ornate jewelry and an embroidered kilt.  As far as who is depicted and how this sculpture was used, we can't be sure.  These kinds of figures seldom depict gods, most, like this one, appear to represent individuals of high rank, they would have been ancestors of aristocratic family lineages.  Like others of its type, this figure probably once stood inside or in front of a small house like temple built upon a flat topped pyramid platform.  It is an effigy intended as a memorial to the deceased.  It looks to be in excellent condition but apparently was, like many others intentionally shattered on the steps of a pyramid, perhaps as an offering to the ancestral dead.  But it may have been destroyed by rivals or an enemy people.  It has since been carefully reconstructed.</p>\n",
