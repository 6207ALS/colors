    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This marble head is a portrait of the Roman emperor Hadrian who ruled from 117 to 138 A.D. More portraits of Hadrian than of any other emperor have been found in the lands once ruled by Rome. Curator Karen Manchester.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: He was an extremely popular emperor.  And he was particularly fond of Greek culture. He happened to have great admiration for the Greeks and, in particular, their philosophy. And as a consequence, he grew a beard which one can see represented faintly on the cheeks of this particular portrait. And this was something that Roman emperors before him had not done. But he adapted the wearing of a beard from Greek philosophers. This particular sculpture is also especially lovely because of the representation of the hair. One can see this great mass of curls over his forehead and deeply drilled. There\u2019s a lot of interplay of light and shadow.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The sculptor used a drill, again, on the eyes to create more realistic pupils.</p>\n",
