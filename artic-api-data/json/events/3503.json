    "description": "<p>>In bestsellers like <em>Ghost</em>, <em>All American Boys</em>, and the new Marvel novel <em>Miles Morales: Spider-Man</em>, award-winning author Jason Reynolds writes young adult narratives that explore the pressures and promise of young people. His freshly pressed<em> Long Way Down</em> is a story, in verse, of a one-minute elevator ride filled with revenge, troubled emotions, friendship, and family where, one floor at a time, a teenage boy faces himself and contemplates the murder of his brother. Like his captive audience, his entire world is caught between those sliding doors. </p><p>>A book signing will follow this program.</p><p>><em>This program is generously underwritten by the Lohengrin Foundation and is presented in partnership with the Chicago Humanities Festival. </em></p><p>>*Ticketholders for this event may enter the museum with their event ticket beginning at 4:00. To enter earlier, please purchase a separate museum admission ticket.</p><p>><strong><a href=\"/calendar?keyword=chicago%20humanities%20Festival\">Find more</a> Chicago Humanities Festival programs hosted at the Art Institute of Chicago. </strong></p><p> class=\"standard-sand\"><strong>About the Speakers</strong></p><p>><strong>Jason Reynolds</strong> was tricked into being a writer.
