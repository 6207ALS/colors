Schniewind, 1969.5\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Henri Matisse traveled to the United States in December of 1930 to work on The Dance (1932\u201333; fig. 43.1), his first large-scale painting commission since Sergei Shchukin asked him to make Dance II (summer\u2013fall 1910; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg) and Music (winter\u2013fall 1910; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg) in 1909. The patron, Dr. Alfred C. Barnes, had already acquired a number of works by the artist, and as he was forming his collection he sought to refine his approach to aesthetic pedagogy. In this endeavor Barnes was influenced in part by the progressive educational theories of the American philosopher John Dewey (see fig. 43.2). Anticipating an intellectual compatibility, Barnes orchestrated a meeting between Dewey and Matisse upon the artist\u2019s arrival in New York. Matisse was drawn to the philosopher\u2019s easy manner and shared his sketches for the mural with him. He also confided his anxiety about working with Barnes. Dewey, then seventy-one and recently retired from Columbia University in New York, was equally taken with Matisse, and the two spent much time together over the following weeks. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying Matisse immensely,\u201d Dewey wrote to Barnes shortly after their meeting, \u201cIt was interesting to see [his] hands move in the rhythm of his forms when he showed the sketches.\u201d\n\nIt was during their time together that Matisse drew several portraits of the philosopher, including this work. In a letter from the beginning of January 1931, Dewey described his experience: \u201cMatisse . . . used me as a model for a lithograph he is going to make\u2014He came half a dozen times &amp; worked for an hour or so each time, making a different [and] entirely new sketch each time.\u201d In addition to the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, Matisse made at least three other portraits of Dewey (see fig. 43.3, fig. 43.4, and fig. 43.5), each rendered quickly and informally.\n\nFor this work, Matisse chose to present a subtle three-quarter view of his subject and employed short, gestural strokes to contour Dewey\u2019s face and define his clothing. The artist used stumping to dramatically soften his charcoal marks to noteworthy effect: the varied, almost \u201cblurred\u201d hatch marks produce shades of black on the right side of the face, hair, and coat. While Matisse moved the medium around on the page to make the portrait, he also removed some to create subtle highlights under the eyes, above the brow, and along the hair. The artist concentrated the charcoal on the eyes, using hatch marks and smudging to achieve a deep black that conveys the sitter\u2019s thoughtful intensity. Dewey\u2019s portrait, casually generated but inventively produced, demonstrates the importance Matisse found in his moments of respite from the increasingly complicated mural he was making for Barnes. As he had during the production of other complicated commissions, the artist relied on drawing as an \u201cinstrument of relief or synthesis.\u201d This loose yet intimate likeness of Dewey records a moment of intellectual energy and invention shared by two luminaries.  \nKatja Rivera\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse relied on light and shade rendered through stumped charcoal to apply modeling in the head in a manner that recalls a sculptor\u2019s process of working with mass. He drew this portrait entirely with a stump and powdered charcoal on ivory laid paper; he never marked the sheet directly with a charcoal stick. Matisse employed the tip of the stump to draw the narrow contour lines around the head, facial features, and proper left shoulder. He used the broad side of the tapered end to apply wide bands of gray charcoal to shade and model the figure (see fig. 43.6). The darkest passages in the eyes and moustache were achieved with multiple charcoal applications. The stumped marks appear actively drawn, lending a spontaneous quality to this portrait. The drawing is not fixed.\n\nThe charcoal Matisse employed has a warm-gray tonality overall while the darkest passages appear brown-black, suggesting a natural charcoal. He could have worked with loose charcoal purchased in a packet or vial or rubbed a charcoal stick against sandpaper to generate the powdery medium for stumping. Although stumps were available in multiple sizes (see fig. 43.7), the relatively consistent width and character of the stumped marks in this work suggest the artist used only one.\n\nMatisse chose to make the portrait on the more textured (wire) side of the paper. As he drew the stump across the paper the charcoal settled onto the high points of the textured surface. The distinct pattern of laid lines and chain lines is evident in the areas of shadow.\n\nPinholes at all corners and at the center of the top edge suggest the sheet was tacked to a support while drawing or tacked up later for study.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 43.8).\n\nMatisse drew using stumped charcoal. He used powdered charcoal, the particles of which appear quite fine under microscope magnification 300\u00d7. The charcoal is likely natural; overall it has a warm-gray hue and the darkest marks appear as a warm brown-black. The charcoal particles, transferred from stump to paper, appear relatively evenly dispersed within the fibrous paper surface (see fig. 43.9).\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory laid paper manufactured by Arches. Chain lines run horizontally at 2.7 cm intervals. The laid line frequency is 9/cm. The paper is moldmade. The fibers appear uniform with the exception of infrequent dark and red fibers visible at magnification 2\u00d7. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left edges are hand torn. For an image of the verso, see fig. 43.10.\n\nThere is a watermark at the lower left edge: Ingres D\u2019Arches (0.8 \u00d7 6.0 cm). There is a countermark at the center of the left edge: MBM (France) (1.5 \u00d7 15. cm) (see fig. 43.11 and fig. 43.12).\n\n63.4 \u00d7 48.2 cm (24 15/16 \u00d7 19 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2015 to repair minor edge tears, remove multiple campaigns of hinges from the verso, and eliminate distortions.\n\nThe sheet is in good condition following conservation treatment.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Collection of the artist (died Nov. 3, 1954), until Nov. 3, 1954.\n\nBy descent to the artist's son, Pierre Matisse (June 13, 1900\u2013Aug. 10, 1989), New York, Nov. 3, 1954\u2013Apr. 14, 1969.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 14, 1969.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Number  \nLocation: lower left corner  \nMethod: graphite  \nContent: 6/83D 1062/57 \u00d7 48 69.5/RX6847 (fig. 43.13)\n\nStamp  \nLocation: lower left corner  \nMethod: black ink stamp  \nContent: PM [in a rectangle] (fig. 43.13)\n\nThe media and their application, as well as the condition of the artwork, were assessed through visual examination using normal, transmitted, and raking light; microscope magnification (80\u2013300\u00d7); and ultraviolet-light examination (254 and 365 nm).
