    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Spanish artist Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes painted this portrait of a government dignitary in about 1810. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM:  Obviously, this is a person of importance, and I think Goya's ability to show that is the way he presents him against a completely stark background. He's almost overwhelmed by the decorations that he carries. He was a minister of justice, a minister of the interior, so he had these high government positions, and so he's wearing the different medals and the ribbon that indicate how far he's risen. And Goya's really setting those off with this wonderful red sash and the gold. And I think his pose, too. That was a popular pose at the time, that hand in the waistcoat, and the way he's just looking</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This pose may look familiar from portraits of the French Emperor Napoleon. Napoleon imposed French rule in Spain in 1808, just before this portrait was made and the sitter, although Spanish, was sympathetic to this political situation. Goya was opposed to French rule. Nevertheless, he painted several portraits of members of the new regime on commission.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: Even then, though, I don't think any of his political feelings come out. I think he took his job very seriously.</p>\n",
