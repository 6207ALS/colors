    "description": "<p>This time everyone's favorite wandering pooch blows through the Windy City with his owner Pete and Pete's family. After exploring the Magnificent\u00a0Mile and scarfing down hot dogs at Navy Pier, the family boards a train at the railway station, losing sight of Larry when the hungry pup pursues a\u00a0tasty snack. Oh no! Will they ever be reunited? While Larry and his family set out to find each other, learn about Chicago landmarks and cultural\u00a0attractions including The Art Institute of Chicago, Wrigley Field, Lake Michigan, Lincoln Park Zoo and the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower).</p>",
