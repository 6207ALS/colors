Its angular features and deep carvings demonstrate Catlett\u2019s confident abstraction of the human form. She was inspired by African art, which she saw as the precursor to modernist abstraction; \u201cAfter all,\u201d she said, \u201cabstraction was born in Africa.\u201d Catlett continued to build on these formal qualities through sculptures, prints, and paintings, developing an expressive, modern aesthetic to depict African American subjects.</p>\n",
