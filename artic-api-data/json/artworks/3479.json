Hung up between the pairs is a large sponge (no sign of an aryballos).  On the reverse are three youths in himatia.  On the left, one faces to the right and gestures with his right hand; the one in the centre faces right but makes no gesture; that on the right faces left seems to move forward and gestures with his right hand.</p>\n<p>The figured scenes are framed on either side by a double row of blobs, below by a red line and above by a frieze of tongues.  The front of the neck is decorated with a frieze of linked elongated buds; the back is undecorated.  On the edge of the rim is a double row of blobs and on the top a frieze of linked lotus buds, as on the neck, with a palmette complex on both handle plates.</p>\n",
