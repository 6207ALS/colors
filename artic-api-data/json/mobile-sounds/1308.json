    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The English architect and designer, William Burges designed this extraordinary sideboard in 1859.  Burges was a key member of the Gothic Revival movement in England.  He advocated a return to the forms, decoration and techniques of Medieval art.  His views were a passionate reaction against the mass produce mediocrity of an increasingly industrial age.  Burges' sideboard borrows elements of Medieval architecture such as the Gothic tracer he painted on the legs of the cabinet.  Above these are two levels of painted decorations, alluding to the sideboard's function as a wine cabinet.  The single heads symbolize different wines.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: On the right is the blonde head that personifies champagne, on the left is the dark haired man with crown as King Burgundy.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Above these, the arched frames contain a story taken from a Medieval poem that playfully extols the virtues of wine personified as the young Saint Bacchus.  The cabinet's decoration is filled with glowing color and meticulous detail, evoking the richness of Medieval stained glass windows.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: This cabinet was made during the reign of Queen Victoria and I think many people have the impression that Victorian interiors were very dark and very gloomy, but you see these brilliant colors and touches of gold in this cabinet and you begin to rethink what Victorian interiors might have been like especially those conceived of by a brilliant man such as William Burges.</p>\n",
