It was while living there that he created what scholars often refer to as the \u201cplumed hat\u201d series (see fig. 29.1, fig. 29.2, fig. 29.3, fig. 29.4, fig. 29.5, fig. 29.6, and fig. 29.7), which includes the Art Institute\u2019s Girl in Plumed Hat (Mlle Antoinette). As with many of his paintings and drawings from this time, Matisse used the nineteen-year-old Antoinette Arnoux as his model.\n\nIn this work, Arnoux wears an elaborate hat with a large ostrich feather that sweeps its way across the brim. Matisse lavished attention on the individual strands of her hair as well as on the fine details of the plume. He may have drawn inspiration from the Promenade des Anglais. Just outside his hotel, it was a choice spot to observe the latest fashions as vacationing Europeans strolled along the sea, and the hat depicted in Matisse\u2019s series, with its large, wispy ostrich feather, was a prime example of a fashion-forward chapeau.\n\nNice was dotted with shops offering millinery supplies from ribbons to large feathers in order for visitors to replicate the trends modeled on the promenade. In fact, Matisse constructed the ornate, plumed hat he depicted himself. Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian and the wife of the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s founding director, Alfred H. Barr, asked Matisse about it while standing in front of his painting White Plumes (1919; fig. 29.1)\u2014the culmination of the plumed hat drawings\u2014at his 1931 retrospective in Paris. She recollected:\n\nI asked him where in creation he\u2019d got that hat, so he laughed welcoming the question and said he\u2019d made it himself. He bought the straw foundation and the feathers and the black ribbon and put it together with pins on the model\u2019s head. He said he had too much black ribbon so that he had to stuff it into the crown with dozens of pins.\n\nThese details can also be seen in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, even the woven straw base is represented by the intricate latticework of lines visible just beyond the ostrich feather at the top of the sheet. Around the time Matisse made the drawing, he told a visitor to his studio that the large plume was \u201can ornament, a decorative element, but it is also a material; one can feel, so to speak, its lightness, and the down seems so soft, impalpable, one could very well be tempted to blow it away.\u201d In Girl in Plumed Hat (Mlle Antoinette), the loose, wispy lines that define the feather are layered at the edges with a shiny, black ink, reinforcing its fluffy texture. Cascading down the sides of the hat, the ribbons are almost tactile\u2014the velvety ink dried on the surface of the paper forms an opaque layer of media that creates a depth and richness suggestive of the many layers of ribbon pinned to the base of the hat.\n\nMatisse explored a wide range of moods in his plumed hat series, depicting Arnoux in various roles as if she were an actress in a play. In one drawing (fig. 29.3) she appears rather innocent and demure, her head tilted ever so slightly, and is drowning in a large robe and oversized hat as if she were playing dress-up in her mother\u2019s closet. In another rendering (fig. 29.4) she is regal and poised. Her left hand, adorned with a wedding band\u2014a prop, Arnoux was unmarried\u2014firmly clutches the arm of a chair as she confidently gazes off into the distance. Alfred Barr situated the Art Institute\u2019s drawing within the series as \u201cthe strangest of all . . . the monstrous hat, bristling and tentacular, as it settles down over the model\u2019s face and shoulders.\u201d The hat appears to take on a life of its own as the rhythm of the curve of the ribbons and the model\u2019s hair over her left shoulder blurs the boundaries between accessory and model. Arnoux\u2019s presence, however, is not entirely lost within the composition. The curve of her chin and her soft lips pierce through the finery of the hat and provide a glimpse of the young model underneath.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse chose pen and two black inks to explore the linear structure of the feather, fabric, and hair in this drawing on cream wove paper. Strong, raking light readily reveals the difference in sheen between the two black inks and how he drew the majority of the composition in matte black ink using both fluid and dry pen strokes. The dry pen strokes produced broken, gray lines as the pen deposited ink only on the top of the faintly textured surface, as in the sitter\u2019s hair. The fluid strokes generated solid lines as seen in the profile contour (see fig. 29.8). In this way, the artist laid in the textured masses of the ostrich feather sweeping down from the hat brim, curling ribbons, flowing hair, and fabric embracing the sitter\u2019s shoulders. Matisse reserved the shiny, deep-black ink for articulating major outlines, including the profile of the face and the shoulders, and applied it fluidly. These firm outlines give just the suggestion of solidity beneath the airy masses of feathers and hair. He also applied this resinous ink over the matte ink throughout to add depth and thereby develop the three-dimensional character of forms and differentiate among materials of similar textures. He created the deep-black curls of ribbon hanging off the back of the hat by layering the shiny black ink over the matte ink until the strokes merged into thick, glossy bands. There are pinholes at all corners, which may indicate Matisse drew with the paper pinned to a board.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 29.9).\n\nMatisse used pen and two different black inks that can be differentiated visually with raking light and with microscope examination. One is more matte and gray-black; the other is a deeper, shiny black with a higher resin content.\n\nThe support is medium thick, smooth, cream wove paper. The sheet is straight cut at the top and sides. The lower edge is slightly uneven, as if torn from a sketchbook. The sheet dimensions remain unchanged since Matisse drew this work; ink extends onto the sheet edges.\n\n27 \u00d7 36.6 cm (10 5/8 \u00d7 14 7/16 in.).\n\nAt some point a backing was removed from the verso (fig. 29.10) of this drawing, leaving brown adhesive staining and fiber residue across it. It is not known when or where this occurred. The drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2014\u201315 to reduce the mount residue. In addition, surface soil was reduced, minor edge tears were repaired, and skinning in one spot on the verso located in the lower left was reinforced with Japanese paper and wheat starch paste. Multiple campaigns of paper hinges were removed from the verso and planar distortions induced by those hinges were eliminated.\n\nThe sheet has discolored to a darker, yellower tone. The right and left edges are lighter and likely retain the original color. There is a golden-brown stain, possibly a fingerprint, near the lower right corner. There are minor edge tears that have been repaired. On the verso, there is a pattern of golden-brown staining imparted by a former mount. The sheet has a subtle backward curl at the top and lower edges.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, May 13, 1925.\n\nSold for 2,000 francs to Pierre Matisse (June 13, 1900\u2013Aug. 10, 1989), New York, Dec. 29, 1925.\n\nSold for $275 to the Arts Club of Chicago, late 1925.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 28, 1927.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Arts Club of Chicago, French Water Colors and Drawings Assembled by Mr. Pierre Matisse, Nov. 6\u201314, 1925, no cat.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 1034, as Study for Plumes.\n\nIowa City, State University of Iowa, Six Centuries of Master Drawings: Thirteenth Annual Fine Arts Festival, July 17\u2013Aug. 1, 1951, cat. 202 (ill.), as Study for \u201cWhite Plumes.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse Retrospective 1966, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 163 (ill.), as Antoinette Wearing Plumed Hat/Antoinette au chapeau \u00e0 plumes, 1919; Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\nBaltimore Museum of Art, Matisse as a Draughtsman, Jan. 12\u2013Feb. 21, 1971, cat. 36 (ill.), as Antoinette Wearing Plumed Hat, ca. 1919; San Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Mar. 20\u2013May 9, 1971; Art Institute of Chicago, May 26\u2013July 10, 1971.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture, May 29\u2013Sept. 7, 1975, cat. 62 (ill.), as Antoinette au chapeau a plumes, profil droit, 1919; Brussels, Palais des Beaux-Arts, as Henri Matisse: Dessins et sculpture/tekeningen en sculpturen, Sept. 27\u2013Oct. 26, 1975, cat. 56 (ill.), as Antoinette au chapeau \u00e0 plumes, profil droit/Antoinette met pluimenhoed in rechts profiel, 1919.\n\nFrankfurt am Main, St\u00e4dtische Galerie St\u00e4delschen Kunstinstitut, Franz\u00f6sische Zeichnungen aus dem Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 10\u2013Apr. 10, 1977, cat. 82 (ill.), as Der Federhut/Le Chapeau \u00e0 plumes.\n\nLondon, Hayward Gallery, The Sculpture and Drawings of Henri Matisse, Oct. 4, 1984\u2013Jan. 6, 1985, cat. 49 (ill.), as Antoinette Wearing Plumed Hat, c. 1919; New York, Museum of Modern Art, Feb. 27\u2013May 14, 1985.\n\nArts Club of Chicago, Portrait of an Era: Rue Winterbotham Carpenter and the Arts Club of Chicago, 1916\u20131931, Sept. 15\u2013Nov. 1, 1986, cat. 8 (ill.), as Mlle Antoinette (originally titled Girl in Plumed Hat), 1919.\n\nStuttgart, Staatsgalerie, Henri Matisse: Zeichnungen und Gouaches D\u00e9coup\u00e9es, Dec. 11, 1993\u2013Feb. 20, 1994, cat. 17 (ill.), as Portrait de Mlle Antoinette (Le chapeau \u00e0 plumes blanches)/Portrait Antoinette (Der Hut mit den weissen Federn), [1919].\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Institute of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, ed.
