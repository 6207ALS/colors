    "transcript": "<p>Oh what bright flowers in a world full of constant chaos<br>But through those bright flowers you see my dark skin, right?<br>Same color as dirt that produces the growth for those bright flowers, right?<br>We\u2019re laid on the ground and drowned in water but to rise up a great piece of art, right?<br>No? Oh I thought so.<br>I\u2019m not meant to be here<br>look down the line<br>I\u2019m the first of my kind to reside where the world didn\u2019t want me too<br>and to the world I will oblige to the cries and the judgement drooping over me but from where?<br>Oh. you. Yeah you.<br>I see you trying to yank away the way I paved<br>Throwing every piece of mud there is to make me sink<br>But I am from the earth, the mud, the dirt. How can that harm me?<br>In the thoughts that I think that might be one that say \u201c I can\u2019t do this anymore \u201d<br>This fierce look is not a facade to respond to your ignorance<br>Far from it<br>I give this look to show the strength in my face<br>Why does that scare you, offend you, or mark me as aggressive<br>Now I\u2019m sitting in a chair far from the ones we were put in<br>Looking at you with these eyes that\u2019s created from the soil<br>Blossomed to the earth\u2019s core, brighter than before<br>Seeing more, being more therefore I am<br>Brightly colored in brown, melanin, yes!<br>From earth I\u2019ve come and from the ground I was made<br>Into that melanin dark flower</p>\n",
