While correcting proofs of his text in Honfleur in August and September 1892, Mallarm\u00e9 was still expecting Desboutin to produce the portrait. When Desboutin\u2019s contribution did not materialize, Mallarm\u00e9 turned the commission over to Whistler, who by this time was a close personal friend. There is a small canceled copper plate bearing a portrait of the poet (now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow) that may be a rejected first attempt to produce the frontispiece for Vers et Prose; the plate size (102 \u00d7 67 mm) would have been compatible with the format of the book, but there are only two known impressions pulled from this plate. Whistler may have switched to transfer lithography because of the technical difficulties involved in printing a large edition from the copper etching plate.\n\nThe transfer drawings for the portrait were made in Whistler\u2019s small quarters at the H\u00f4tel du Bon Lafontaine on the rue de Grenelle, where he and his wife were staying while they waited for work to be completed on the residence they had leased at 110, rue du Bac. Several contemporary accounts suggest that Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s sitting was a long and grueling one, with Whistler making and rejecting several studies before he was finally satisfied. The Pennells (1908) wrote that Whistler made the drawings on \u201cthin textureless transfer paper, thin as tissue paper, which delighted him, though it was difficult to work on. When he was doing the Mallarm\u00e9, I remember he put the paper down on a roughish book cover.\u201d Henri de R\u00e9gnier later recalled Mallarm\u00e9 telling friends that Whistler had him pose in front of the fireplace and, preoccupied with his drawing, would not let the poet change his pose until the work was completed, by which time Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s legs had been burned. In 1904 Th\u00e9odore Duret wrote: \u201cThis little figure, while coming as an improvisation, is none the less due to close and prolonged work. Whistler had kept Mallarm\u00e9 posing a pretty long time. He drew rapidly, as the idea of the light sketch he wished to make dictated, but the first likenesses thus obtained, before he had thoroughly penetrated his model, seemed to him feeble and he tore them up to begin all over again.\u201d\n\nThe printer Lemercier had initially been selected to process and print the transfer drawing for the Mallarm\u00e9 frontispiece. On October 27 Whistler sent a note asking the poet to come to the hotel to see the stone bearing the transferred portrait. By November 2 the artist had decided that Lemercier\u2019s processing was unsatisfactory and that the job should instead be consigned to Belfond, who had been far more successful in transferring Whistler\u2019s drawings in the past. Ultimately, it was Belfond who transferred and editioned the portrait (cat. 69) published in Vers et Prose.\n\nThere is evidence that the very rare Portrait of Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, No. 2 may be the image initially transferred to stone in the Lemercier shop. Records of the Lemercier firm located in 1904 by Whistler\u2019s lawyer, A. Ratier, documented work on two images, \u201cportrait\u2014portrait de femme,\u201d on 30 November 1892. The first item probably refers to a portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 and the second to the small portrait of Charlotte Williams (cat. 58). One of the four known impressions of Stephane Mallarm\u00e9, No. 2, in The Art Institute of Chicago (fig. 59a), was printed on the same cream laid paper (226 \u00d7 181 mm) used to print four impressions of the Charlotte Williams portrait. It is likely that this altered early trial was made in the Lemercier shop, while the rest of the impressions of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, No. 2 were printed after the work had been taken to the Belfond studio. All three appear on mounted wove paper, and one of these (in a private collection in Paris) bears the Belfond blind stamp. The Chicago impression was an experimental proof. The sitter\u2019s left hand and the butterfly signature have been deliberately removed from the sheet, and the paper is thinned and abraded in these areas.\n\nWhen Th\u00e9odore Duret wrote about the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait commission in his 1904 study of Whistler and his work, he chose to illustrate both this image and the one that was ultimately selected for the frontispiece of Vers et Prose (cat. 60). His description seems even better suited to this rejected image than to the final portrait: \u201cMallarm\u00e9 is astoundingly lifelike, the arm in movement, the head thrown forward, according to his wont when conversing with his friends. Those who have known him can believe they hear him speak.\u201d\n\nCHICAGO: AIC, cream laid paper (226 \u00d7 181 mm), signed.

Weintraub suggested that Whistler was reciprocating Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s work translating the \u201c[glossary:Ten O'Clock]\u201d lecture, which was published in Paris in 1891; Stanley Weintraub, Whistler: A Biography (New York, 1974), p. 351. That same year Mallarm\u00e9 was one of several admirers who urged the French state to purchase Whistler\u2019s portrait of his mother for the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg.\n\nThe production of Belgian editions of Vers et Prose had followed a similar trajectory: the publisher Edmond Deman wanted to use a frontispiece designed by F\u00e9licien Rops, which had appeared in an 1887 edition, for a new 1891 edition. Mallarm\u00e9 hoped to replace the Rops frontispiece with one by Whistler, but Whistler\u2019s extended absence from France at that time prevented a formal arrangement. Furthermore, as Mallarm\u00e9 noted in a letter to Deman of 18 August 1891, Whistler was likely to be unwilling to attempt a large edition (1,000) of an etching; Barbier (1964), p. 94. In addition to the canceled copper plate, the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, also has a unique impression of an uncatalogued drypoint portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 seated in front of a mirror. It would have been too large for the frontispiece of the French edition of Vers et Prose, however. See Margaret MacDonald, Whistler and Mallarm\u00e9, exh. cat.

Ratier may have misread the date in the Lemercier books as November rather than October, or the work may have been listed in the books only when payment was received. Evidence from the Whistler-Mallarm\u00e9 correspondence, as well as the dates of Charlotte Williams\u2019s sojourn in Paris, support a date in late October for the processing of these images.\n\nIt is this impression that is illustrated in the Kennedy (1914) and Levy (1975) catalogues.\n\nDuret (1904), p. 124; translated in Duret (1917), p. 84.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 59, only state.
