Although he had previously experimented with found objects and sculpture, Magritte did not conceive of painting \u201cin the round\u201d until the war years, when discarded bottles\u2014many of his favored Bordeaux, but also port and sherry\u2014proved useful for his playful experiments at the intersection of painting and sculpture. Over his lifetime, Magritte created more than 25 works in this format, many of which he presented to his friends as gifts.</p>\n",
