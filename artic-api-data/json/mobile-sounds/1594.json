    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: &quot;All my life I have sought to render the essence of flight.\u201d These are the words of Constantin Br\u00e2ncusi who started work on this abstract work titled \u201cGolden Bird\u201d in 1919. Br\u00e2ncusi, who was Romanian by birth, lived and worked for most of his career in Paris where he developed a new approach to making sculpture, simplifying forms until he had paired them down to the pure expression of his subjects\u2019 essential character. The Golden Bird's elegant golden lines reach upward evoking the silhouette of a bird lifting its beak to the sky and the gleaming bronze with its almost fluid reflections suggest the speed of flight. It contrasts with the more Earth-bound stone and wood of the base elements. Stephanie D'Alessandro, Curator of Modern Art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Br\u00e2ncusi was constantly combining and re-combining almost on a daily basis the component parts of his sculptures and also focusing not just on that whole work, but on the relationship of that work to the others in the space. A visitor to his studio would come one day and see a sculpture looking a certain way and come the next day and find parts of it re-combined on another piece. We\u2019re standing in a gallery that features three of the great Br\u00e2ncusis in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. And, so, for us, these works seem to have their most perfect home in this space where they have now another communication, another relationship with the light and space just outside the museum with Millennium Park and the life of the street.</p>\n",
