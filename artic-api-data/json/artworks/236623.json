    "description": "<p>Rodney McMillian\u2019s work grapples with the complexities of race, class, and place in America across a wide range of media. In his sculpture he often redeploys domestic materials and approaches the conventional terms of painting\u2014 wall-bound, cloth-based. He engages not only history and contemporary culture but also the potential for alternative realities and future transformation.<p>\n<p>The giant, ominous, bodily forms of <em>Untitled (lungs)</em> manifest current political and social tensions through their own insistent physicality: they simultaneously project into the room and hang abjectly down toward the floor; their shapes are soft and organic, but their surfaces are opaque and appear calcified; they are absurdly larger than life, but they prompt greater awareness of our own fragile, pulsing bodies.<p>\n",
