    "description": "Static Range is a multi-disciplinary and multi-limbed project using a real-life spy story in the Indian Himalayas as a canvas for speculations and reflections about nuclear culture, porosity, leakages, toxicity and love, spiritual-scientific entanglements, environmental catastrophe, and post-nation states. This series of transmissions that make up 'static range', includes an animated stamp, letters, music, embroidery, healing, planting, and a performance installation. <br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The book, Static Range, takes its inspiration from stamp booklets and flip books: it forms an analog version of the eponymous animation in which the mountain, Nanda Devi, morphs into the nuclear sublime, radiant and blemished. Made with organic cellulose paper and entirely lickable, each page contains four perforated stamps. It is held by a screen-printed cover on cloth, and a wrapper containing an epistolary exchange between the mountain and the nuclear-powered spy device that is lodged inside it, as well as three newly commissioned texts. Necessarily, the only way to consume this book is to destroy it.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 132</li>\n</ul>",
