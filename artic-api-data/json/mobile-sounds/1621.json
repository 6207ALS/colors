    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the late 1880s the French artist Paul Gauguin dreamed of moving to some distant exotic place where he and his art could flourish, free from what he experienced as the taint of modern civilization. At the 1889 Universal Exhibition in Paris he saw displays of art and dancing from several nonwestern cultures, including Java. Entranced by these, and by fantasies of artistic rebirth and easy living in one of France\u2019s colonial territories he made plans to settle abroad and establish what he called a studio of the tropics. After much deliberation, Gauguin finally settled on Tahiti and planned his departure. This painting was made a few months after Gauguin\u2019s arrival in Tahiti in 1891. The idyllic landscape is filled with lush vegetation that nourishes and protects the people who live in the dwellings nearby. Beyond the figure in red, for instance, is a row of banana trees, and at the painting\u2019s left side is a tall tree whose bark is tinged with violet. This is a hotu, whose pods and flowers were used by local people as remedies. At the lower left Gauguin inscribed the Tahitian words, \u201cTe raau rahi,\u201d meaning, the big tree. He often gave his works Tahitian titles to enhance their sense of mysterious exoticism for the European audience he intended should see and purchase his work.</p>\n",
