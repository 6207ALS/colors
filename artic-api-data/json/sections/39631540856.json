Although he lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, the planks on which he carved this pair, which derived from the same piece of wood, must have been in the best condition among the group of ten blocks. While the grain of the planks is visible in impressions pulled from both, the planks are not as coarse, nor are the irregularities in their surfaces as abundant, as those present in others used for the suite. Even so, these irregularities still set the prints in the suite apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images that make up Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite (cats. 51\u201360). Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nGauguin first printed a couple of trial proofs of this wood block in black ink and then printed the first state in an edition of about thirty impressions on thin, translucent Japanese papers\u2014not in the black ink that characterizes the majority of prints in the series, but rather in dark-gray or ocher inks. The production of a large number of first-state impressions in an expanded ink palette suggests that Gauguin had other aspirations for these impressions from early on in their production, and indeed, he used them in a most innovative manner by adhering second-state impressions printed on translucent, diaphanous sheets of [glossary:Japanese] paper on top of them (see cat. 104.2). Elements of the first-state impressions may be read through the second-state impressions. This impression was clearly intended as a trial proof given that it was printed in black ink and that Gauguin selectively toned it with touches color.\n\nThe wood block was printed in black ink. Gauguin added touches of brush-applied red and black watercolor, hand applying the red watercolor over the black printing ink to tone the face and upper body of the standing figure to the left of center. Under magnification particles of red pigment are clearly visible over the ink (see fig. 104.1.2).\n\nThe artist then used a dry brush and black watercolor to scumble a shadow along the left side of her skirt (seefig. 104.1.3). He used the same technique to tone some of the foliage that surrounds her (see fig. 104.1.4). The impression evinces some smudging, and the addition of scumbled watercolor passages may have been the artist\u2019s attempt to minimize its appearance in the center of the composition.\n\nFor this impression of the first state, before the flower at center and the bird at left were removed from the block when it was reworked to produce the second state (see cat. 104.2), Gauguin reused a sheet of paper that had previously been folded vertically through the center. The paper is a machine-made cream wove paper of average thickness used most commonly as stationery and it is moderately sized. In printing, the ink gathered along the crease to form a black line through the center of the composition. The sheet has been irregularly trimmed on all sides, and the crude scissor cuts are especially evident along the right and bottom edges.\n\n162 \u00d7 305 mm (image); 165 \u00d7 305 mm (sheet)\n\nThe finely incised lines in this first-state impression suggest that this particular plank of wood may not have been as soft and easily chipped by Gauguin\u2019s tools as others in the group. His incising appears throughout, the finest of which is in the foreground at center and in the upper right. When he altered the block to produce the second state, Gauguin gouged away many of the more finely incised passages, perhaps to make this composition more visually consistent with the rest of the group.\n\nAt some point before the print entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it had been removed from a mount. In transmitted light there is visible skinning in horizontal bands across the verso. As noted above, the sheet was also irregularly trimmed with scissors.\n\nIn 2002 the print was examined, and treatment was carried out to reduce staining in the top corners, remove residual hinging papers and adhesive from the verso, mend small tears, and fill a minute loss in the upper left corner.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. In raking light pronounced undulation in the sheet is visible. The undulation is caused by the uneven sheet thickness due to backing removal as well as residual adhesive embedded in the paper fibers. On the verso, skinned paper fibers appear disrupted and lift slightly from the surface on the verso.  \nHarriet K.

Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nGauguin wrote to Vollard in January 1900: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d Gauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, reprinted in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190. See also Richard R. Brettell, \u201cSuite of Late Woodcuts, 1898\u20131899,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F. Stuckey, The Art of Paul Gauguin, with assistance from Peter Zegers, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice. See also cats. 93 and 94, 96 and 97, 100 and 101, and 102 and 103 for paired examples of extant wood blocks that originally formed one thicker block.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . . Faites sur des planches quelconques et avec des yeux de plus en plus mauvais, ces gravures sortent forc\u00e9ment du sale m\u00e9tier ordinaire et sont tr\u00e8s imparfaites, mais elles sont je crois int\u00e9ressantes comme Art\u201d (I am sending you a small series of wood engravings. . . .

Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 209, cat. 54.\n\nGauguin also printed some second-state impressions directly over first-state impressions, although here the prints have a less ethereal quality. See, for example, an impression in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris.\n\nWhen the media are assessed under magnification, there is no evidence that the red watercolor was applied with a stencil, as Gauguin had done when adding color by hand to impressions of his Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, cat. 54.3).\n\nKristi Dahm, condition report and treatment record, Nov. 2002, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDouglas W.
