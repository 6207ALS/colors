    "description": "<p>Joseph Jachna studied under Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind at Chicago\u2019s Institute of Design (ID), receiving his master\u2019s degree in 1961 with a thesis comprising photographs of water. That year was a turning point for his career: his images were featured in a special issue of <em>Aperture</em> magazine dedicated to five students at the ID, and Hugh Edwards mounted his first one-man exhibition  at the Art Institute. About half of the show focused on  pictures of water\u2014reflections, distortions, and landscapes\u2014and Edwards wrote that \u201cJachna\u2019s prints express deep introspection\u201d and \u201ca poetic sensibility for the significance of small objects.\u201d He later acquired 20 photographs for the collection.</p>\n",
