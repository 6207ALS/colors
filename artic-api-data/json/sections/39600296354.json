Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the aesthetic evolution of the suite.\n\nThis hand-colored, second-state impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) was printed without any manipulation of the matrix such as skewing the registration in a double printing, transferring media from another surface, or selectively wiping the block. Here the block was printed only once in black. The artist brushed colored media over the printing ink to create his desired atmospheric and textural effects.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 56.1.2).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 56.1.3).\n\nThe wood block was printed in carbon black ink (see fig. 56.1.4). After printing, Gauguin brush applied watercolors to tone various passages and set them apart from each other. Barely discernible passages of pink that appear in the distant sky in the upper left and in the foreground behind the figure are a much-faded cochineal lake. Faint passages of dilute ultramarine blue appear in sky as well as in the decorative band at left. Thicker applications of ultramarine blue, as well as a green tone that is a mixture of viridian and cadmium yellow, appear in the flowers in the foreground (fig. 56.1.5). Yellow-orange present in the figure\u2019s body is a mixture of vermilion with cadmium yellow.\n\nThe artist also used a silvery-gray wash that he brush applied with great specificity to white-line passages in the composition. Magnification reveals that these brushstrokes contain a great deal of gum that gathers along the edges of the strokes and reflects light, causing the overall silvery appearance. Gauguin\u2019s applications of it appear along the contour of the back of the figure\u2019s proper right leg, in the line that forms the left branch of the forked tree in the right middle ground, and in a series of curved lines below the tree in the background to the right. This medium, here and in other impressions from the Noa Noa Suite, was used to purposefully push bright lines into shadow (see, for example, L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [The Universe Is Being Created] [cat. 54.2]).\n\nThe paper is a moderately thick, smooth, tan wove paper. The paper fibers in the sheet are distributed evenly, and the paper is of a uniform color. There are no inclusions or colored fibers. The paper is heavily sized. As a result, it remains deeply embossed from the pressure exerted upon it during the printing process. In raking light, the pronounced embossment of the sheet and a series of striations on the verso are products of the artist\u2019s method of printing. The pressure exerted in printing the block on this type of Western paper was substantial. The depth of the embossment signals that the artist likely used his fingertips to press the dampened paper into the interstices of the wood block. In order to fully assess the embossment, surface shape studies were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image to capture the topography of the surface of the paper (see fig. 56.1.3).\n\nThe paper is identical to that used for an impression of Noa Noa (cat. 51.1) and exhibits the same degree of embossment. Under ultraviolet light a pattern of rubbing is visible on the verso of the print, where Gauguin used an implement, perhaps the back of a wooden spoon or handle of a tool, to transfer ink from the wood block to the paper (fig. 56.1.1). From the top to the bottom of the sheet there are a series of vertical strokes that follow the trajectory of Gauguin\u2019s hand. Initially thought to be residual adhesive from the removal of a layer of paper, they do not fluoresce under ultraviolet, nor is there any evidence of residual paper fibers. These instead are byproducts of the artist\u2019s technique.\n\nThe edges of the sheet are straight cut although slightly irregular. The paper has been trimmed close to the printed image. There is approximately 1\u20132 mm of paper margin remaining around the image on all sides.\n\n354 \u00d7 200 mm (image); 357 \u00d7 204 mm (sheet)\n\nRed, blue, green, yellow, orange, and silver-gray watercolor were hand applied over the printed image. Some of these passages have faded considerably and are better viewed under magnification. From the evidence of color that remains, it is clear that in areas of the print that now appear to be devoid of ink and include those behind the trees and in the brook that runs behind the female figure, dilute washes of red and blue watercolor were used. Although much faded, tide lines visible adjacent to inked passages indicate that the media were applied in a very dilute, fluid consistency in broad swaths (fig. 56.1.6). The nature of the paper prevented the watercolor from penetrating into the sheet too deeply, so it is not possible to ascertain what the unfaded colors would have looked like from examination of the verso. However, examination of the accumulated pigment particles along tide lines confirms that these colors were once much more vibrant. Passages that were once blue are now an almost-indiscernible pale gray. Red passages are now very pale pink. The sky was once awash in pink that blended into blue, hinting that the scene could have been one taking place at sunset or sunrise (fig. 56.1.7) (see also Maruru [Offerings of Gratitude] [cat. 55.2]). Pigments that were characterized using scientific analysis and determined to have significantly altered over time were digitally restored in a recolorized image, which suggests how those passages of the print might have originally looked (fig. 56.1.8). While not meant to be read as an exact representation of the work\u2019s original appearance, the recolorization was based on scientific and visual analysis of this impression and watercolors found in Gauguin\u2019s original Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti manuscript, which have been protected from light exposure in the bound volume and are unfaded as a result.\n\nNot all hand-applied media are diminished, however. A brush-applied, deep red-orange vermilion was used on the two winglike forms above the lizard. Here, by taking advantage of the water-based medium\u2019s resistance to the solvent-based printing ink, random patterns of beaded media create a surface pattern that is visually similar to that achieved by the transfer of waxy media found in other impressions. Beading of the red-orange watercolor resulted when it was applied over printing ink that had not yet dried completely. The small, round pools formed as a result of the media\u2019s aversion to the wet oil-based ink (fig. 56.1.9). Similar pools of aqueous color appear in the extended left arm of the female figure, these brushed in a golden-yellow tone. The rest of her body is punctuated by hand applications of this same yellow; however, in these areas it was applied when the printing ink had dried sufficiently to prevent beading of the watercolor.\n\nThe hand-colored print was conserved in anticipation of this publication. When discoloration was removed from the sheet, its tone brightened significantly, and the colors now appear more vibrant. Comparison with watercolor passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape [Women at the River] [cat. 59.2]), and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with an ivory hue rather than a golden tone.\n\nThe print is in very good condition.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon. To return to the original view, click on the return icon (semicircle with arrow).\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF, Raman microspectroscopy, and SERS analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTime and time again the silvery medium appears in Gauguin\u2019s hand-colored impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see also Te po [The Night] [cat. 52.1] and L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [cat. 54.2]).

Mellon Fellow in Paper Conservation at the Art Institute, for creating this recolorization. Our firsthand examination of the artist\u2019s manuscript, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, provided us with a better visual understanding of the original vibrancy of the artist\u2019s watercolor palette. Works within the manuscript were visually compared to find examples that bore close tonal similarities to the Chicago sheet. Broadway used these to simulate what the original appearance of the Chicago sheet may have looked like.\n\nVisual analysis of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti manuscript was undertaken in September 2015 at the Cabinet des Dessins, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris. The manuscript resides in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, and access was graciously provided by Le\u00efla Jarbouai, Conservatrice Dessin, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and Mus\u00e9e de l\u2019Orangerie, Paris.\n\nMary Broadway, conservation report and treatment record, Mar. 2015; Harriet K.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
