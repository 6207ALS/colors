    "description": "<p>Forced indoors by inclement fall weather, Claude Monet painted <em>Boats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat</em> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81540/the-departure-of-the-boats-etretat\"><em>The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat</em></a> while looking out the window of his room at the H\u00f4tel Blanquet. The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hosched\u00e9, dated November 24, 1885, Monet he described first <em>Boats on the Beach</em> and then <em>Departure of the Boats</em>: \u201cIn the afternoon, I worked in my room on my <em>caloges</em> [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.\u201d</p>\n<p>Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in <em>Boats on the Beach</em>, and the groups of figures at the water\u2019s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in <em>Departure of the Boats</em>.</p>\n",
