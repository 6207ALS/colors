The first, The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102), was sent to London on August 22 to be transferred and printed by the Ways. It was followed nearly two weeks later by The Smith, Passage du Dragon, which was sent to the printers on September 2. In the letter accompanying The Smith, Whistler explained that he had used a different kind of transfer paper for the new drawing (letter 116). While The Forge had been drawn on the thin, loose papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler favored for \u201clamp effects and deep interiors,\u201d The Smith was executed on a sheet mounted on a heavier secondary support (as were cat. 99 and cat. 100).\n\nThere is evidence that Whistler planned from the outset to create a pair of images. In a letter to his printers postmarked August 21, the day before he sent the first subject, the artist urged the Ways to \u201chave the stones with fine grain ready so that the drawings could be popped on in all freshness\u201d (letter 108). He then added, \u201cProbably by tomorrows post a couple,\u201d implying that he hoped to have two drawings to send. In fact, he only made one drawing, because he had not yet received a further supply of the loose variety of transfer paper from Lemercier (see letter 116). Still determined to make a second drawing of the subject, he must have returned to the passage du Dragon with the mounted transfer paper. It is unlikely that Whistler drew the two images on different papers on the same day; he understood the importance of transferring lithographic drawings promptly to stone, before the sensitive paper deteriorated in any way, and he would not have retained the mounted drawing for two weeks before sending it to London.\n\nAs in the case of The Forge, the Ways had difficulties in transferring The Smith, and the first proofs from the stone were spotty and uneven in many areas. Whistler tried to analyze the problems of The Smith in a long letter sent to his printers on September 14 (letter 118). It reads in part: \u201cThe failure is really I believe more my fault, than yours\u2014Take the stump fellow\u2014My work here was not sharp enough and bright enough\u2014It was too much nagged at\u2014you like the paper\u2014and I rather wore it out.\u201d The artist continued to write to the Ways about technical problems with the two forge subjects in succeeding letters, and he maintained his conviction that the difficulties could be overcome. Eventually, Whistler reworked both this stone and The Forge, Passage du Dragon. Soon after The Smith was transferred, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the top window, writing to the Ways that \u201cI have half a mind to scrape that out altogether\u201d (letter 120). When he finally made his changes to the stone, however, he instead elaborated and extended the window.\n\nThe records of the Fine Art Society show that Whistler was billed for twenty impressions of The Smith, Passage du Dragon printed by the Ways for the 1895\u201396 exhibition (app. III.1). Two impressions that were purchased during the exhibition can be identified: an impression of the second state, now in The Art Institute of Chicago (fig. 103a), and a third-state impression purchased by A. H. Studd and bequeathed to the British Museum, London (app. III.3). Interestingly, The Smith, Passage du Dragon was second in popularity only to The Little Nude Model, Reading (cat. 33) at the exhibition; eleven impressions of the smithy subject were sold.\n\nThe image as originally drawn with crayon and stump on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal reveals somewhat mottled and uneven shadows in the interior of the workshop. The drawing initially transferred poorly; consequently, the lines in this state tend to be spotty and weak in several areas.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), grayish white chine (257 \u00d7 172 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (342 \u00d7 253 mm), signed; ivory wove proofing paper (287 \u00d7 221 mm). Glasgow: HAG, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 206 mm). London: BM, grayish ivory chine (258 \u00d7 173 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (333 \u00d7 240 mm). Washington: FGA (2), ivory wove proofing paper (288 \u00d7 225 mm); cream laid paper (323 \u00d7 208 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in Cleveland, CMA.\n\nThe image has been enlarged by the continuation of the arch on the upper facade and by extended ground lines at the base of the shopfront on either side of the doorway. The tail has been added to the black dog in the foreground, and diagonal lines have been added to the ground near its forelegs. The line crossing the bottom of the doorway has been reinforced. A short diagonal line has been added at lower right, delineating the bottom of the shuttered door. New vertical strokes outline the door panel on the left. The shadows in the interior of the workshop have been darkened by additional crayon strokes and stumping. The addition of tone has darkened the smith\u2019s apron at his chest and between his legs. Touches of stumping have modeled his face and further defined the shape of the anvil. Stump work has also added soft shadows to the ground within and in front of the shop, to the folding doors, to the lintel above the door, and along the lower edge of the upper facade. Considerable new line work throughout the image has reinforced the areas that printed weakly in the first state. All second-state alterations were made directly on the stone and have a notably finer appearance than the lines transferred from the original drawing.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove Japanese vellum (309 \u00d7 231 mm), signed. London: BM, grayish white chine (276 \u00d7 190 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (334 \u00d7 239 mm).\n\nTwo short lines (one on the left outer edge of the arch and the other above the left window) and one stray crayon mark (on the right, outside the arch) have been removed from the stone. Two horizontal ground lines at lower right have been erased, with the exception of one short segment (often cropped from impressions on small sheets of paper).\n\nGlasgow: HAG (6), grayish ivory chine (277 \u00d7 191 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (345 \u00d7 255 mm), signed; cream laid paper (364 \u00d7 248 mm), signed; cream laid paper (320 \u00d7 206 mm); cream Japanese paper (355 \u00d7 238 mm); grayish ivory chine (278 \u00d7 191 mm) mounted on cream plate paper (345 \u00d7 252 mm), signed; cream laid paper (363 \u00d7 247 mm), signed. London: BM, cream laid paper (363 \u00d7 245 mm), signed. Washington: NGA, ivory laid paper (364 \u00d7 247 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other third-state impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Brooklyn, TBM; Cambridge, Mass., FAM; and New York, MMA.  \nNesta R.
