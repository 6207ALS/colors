    "description": "<p>Odilon Redon himself described this drawing as representing \u201ca primitive being contemplating the head of a giant.\u201d During Redon\u2019s life, new ideas of evolution provoked a fascination with other societies that were unmediated by industrialization and which Europeans viewed as \u201cprimitive\u201d and closer to the natural world. Redon\u2019s figures relate to these racially insensitive romanticized stereotypes, while also revealing other windows of creative thought.<br>Although the work evokes the biblical story of David and Goliath, its mood is mysterious and reflective rather than triumphant.</p>\n<p>This is one of Redon\u2019s celebrated black-and-white works he called \u201cnoirs\u201d (blacks), which were strange, often disturbing images derived from the subconscious mind or dream world. In them, the artist deftly applied velvety charcoal and black chalk using a repertory of techniques\u2014wiping, rubbing, erasing\u2014to bring out a rich variety of tonal, chromatic, and textural effects.</p>\n",
