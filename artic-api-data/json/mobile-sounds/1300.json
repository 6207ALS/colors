    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: At first glance, this looks like a console or side table but, in fact, half of its top surface is currently folded down against the wall. When opened up, the table becomes a grand center piece with decorative carving around all four of its sides. It would be impossible to draw in a chair comfortably beneath these carvings. So if this is not a dining table, how might it have been used. A clue is in the rams\u2019 heads carved on each leg. In classical imagery rams are associated with Bacchus, god of wine and festivities. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE::  It probably served as a stage for perhaps elaborate pieces of silver. And I think the details of the carving, for example, the rams\u2019 heads with horns and the pendent grapevines that fall from the mouths of the rams I think that indicates that the table may have been used for ceremonial occasions or banquets that included a sideboard full of silver that related to the drinking of wine.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: :  The quantity of expensive Cuban mahogany and the grand scale of the table indicate that it would have been an expensive special commission.</p>\n",
