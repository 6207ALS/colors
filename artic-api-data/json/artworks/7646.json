    "description": "<p>Jean Louis Forain is best known as a prodigious draftsman and graphic artist, who regularly contributed illustrations to the satirical papers in Paris from the 1870s on. He also produced a small but substantial body of paintings. Until I900, these were closely related in style and subject matter to the art of the Impressionists, with whom Forain exhibited repeatedly between 1879 and 1886. After 1900, the artist's work changed considerably as a result of an intense renewal of his religious faith and an accompanying desire to imbue his work with greater seriousness. Forain abandoned the bright palette of the Impressionists in favor of a somber, dramatic style of painting, reflecting the influence of <a href=\u201dhttps://www.artic.edu/artists/40769\u201d>Rembrandt van Rijn</a>, <a href=\u201chttps://www.artic.edu/artists/40615\u201d> Francisco Goya</a>, and <a href=\u201chttps://www.artic.edu/artists/40517\u201d> Honore Daumier</a>. At the same time, he turned increasingly for his subjects to Biblical themes, as in his many versions of <em>The Prodigal Son</em>, and to courtroom scenes, which focus on the plight of ordinary people caught in the web of the French legal system.</p>\n<p>In this fine painting, Forain deftly sketched the last scene in a trial, using a palette largely limited to black, brown, and a few strategically placed touches of white. At center, the defendant, who has just escaped the death penalty by being sentenced to life imprisonment, bends in a gesture of abject gratitude to kiss the hand of his lawyer. The lawyer, who is the focus of Forain's satire, is shown swelling with self-importance and pride, completely oblivious to the tragedy that has befallen his client and his family. Raising his head high with a smug, self-satisfied expression, he is juxtaposed to the figure on the far right, who, barely visible both to us and to the justice system, buries her head as she weeps into a handkerchief. Presumably a relative or perhaps even the wife of the condemned man, she stands for the many unsung victims of so-called justice. In contrast to the lawyer, the guard seems to show some sympathy for the condemned man, perhaps because he is also an ordinary man without the self-serving pretensions often associated with the administrators of justice. As the guard hovers above the accused, he extends his arm over his shoulders in a complex gesture that is both a reminder that the man must follow him soon to prison and an expression of comfort and human solidarity. In this incisive piece of social commentary, Forain revealed all the ironies and hollowness of a system that dispenses justice without compassion. </p>\n<p>\u2014Entry,  Margherita Andreotti, <em>Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies</em>, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 140-141.</p>\n",
