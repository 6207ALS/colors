    "description": "<p>Photographs, drawings, and printed materials created or collected by Morgan, an architect and professor of architecture primarily known for his work as an architectural illustrator and delineator. Morgan worked as an architect for the firm Davidson, Lockwood &amp; Morgan, leaving in 1915 to create his own architectural design and rendering firm. In 1926 Morgan went to Europe to sketch with Frank Brangwyn, which led to him publishing Color Sketches: Spain, France, England in 1927. Upon his return to the U.S. he worked as an associate architect for the famed Powhatan Building in Chicago and as an associate of Frank Lloyd Wright. He also served as a delineator and artist for architectural firms across Chicago, including Holabird &amp; Roche, Dubin &amp; Eisenberg, and George C. Nimmons and Co., among others. From 1933-1937, Morgan taught architecture at Kansas State College, Manhattan, before moving to Lakeland, Florida to serve as Wright\u2019s \u201cpersonal representative\u201d during the construction of Florida Southern College.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Morgan,%20Charles%20L.%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
