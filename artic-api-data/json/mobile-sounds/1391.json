    "transcript": "<p>JANICE KATZ:  What we\u2019re looking at here is a guardian whose called Shukongojin.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Janice Katz, assistant curator of Japanese art.</p>\n<p>JANICE KATZ:  In his right hand, he holds the stylized thunderbolt that\u2019s called a Vajra. And this is to cast down any doubt, any kind of obstacles in the path to enlightenment and to understanding the Buddhist law.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The sculptor represented the irresistible energy of wisdom and enlightenment as a violent, divine wind. It churns up the tumultuous water at the feet of the enraged scowling figure. It tosses the belt of his animal skin garment and raises the flames on his head. They\u2019re another symbol of enlightenment like the third eye in his forehead. As such Buddhist guardian figures traveled east they were translated into local styles.</p>\n<p>JANICE KATZ: This is a period in Japanese Buddhist sculpture when the sense of realism is infused into the figures and you get things like this hyper real musculature with veins popping out and very intense look to the figure\u2019s faces especially in these guardian figures who are supposed to cast fear into the enemies of Buddha.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Aren\u2019t you glad he\u2019s on your side?</p>\n",
