    "description": "<p>Charles White dedicated himself to portraying the African American community with dignity. Contrary to stereotypical representations of African Americans common during the postwar era, White consistently depicted his subjects as strong and proud. An immensely talented draftsman, White wanted others to be conscious of the pride he had in his people, and he believed that art was the most appropriate tool for relaying this message to the public. White focused on African American women during the 1950s and throughout his career, even devoting a solo exhibition in New York to the subject. For this show White created pieces that honored the strength of black women including works such as <em>Harriet Tubman</em> (1949; private collection) and <em>Mother</em> (1945; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). When asked about the exhibition, White explained the the African American woman deserves \u201ca great deal more recognition for the never-ending sacrifices she has made and the continuing leadership she has given in the struggles of the Negro people for full equality.\u201d</p>\n<p>During this time, White created <em>Portrait of a Woman</em>, 1950, which shows a contemporary working-class African American woman. The subject\u2019s large eyes are inviting and warm, but the noticeable bags, along with her wrinkled face, imply that her life has been hard. Plainly clothed with simply styled hair and no jewelry, she is obviously a commoner, but White\u2019s depiction suggests that although she may not be conventionally beautiful or important, she still has her dignity. Furthermore, her striking doleful eyes address the viewer directly in a tender gaze.<br>Increasingly leftist in his political views, White\u2019s admiration for the working classes is visible in his murals, his paintings, and his works on paper.  White chose to focus not only on inequalities and degradation experienced by African Americans, but also the humanity and beauty he saw in them. White\u2019s <em>Portrait of a Woman</em> celebrates his subject by portraying her as valuable and worthy of not only his artistic representation, but also of our respect. Through masterful renditions such as <em>Portrait of a Woman</em>, White offered an alternative, uplifting narrative of the African American experience.</p>\n",
