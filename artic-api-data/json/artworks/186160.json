This site is adjacent to Cabrini Green, a housing project whose name has become synonymous with all that is wrong with public housing.\n\nFounded and managed by Ken Dunn, a native Kansan with a family background in farming and a master\u2019s degree in philosophy from the University of Chicago, City Farm begins by leasing vacant lots, cleaning them and then putting down a protective clay barrier to prevent leaching of any toxic materials contained in the site. Fresh soil is then brought in and fertilized with discarded trimmings from restaurants and grass clippings that would normally go to landfill. Unemployed and homeless people are invited to apply for apprenticeships and jobs on these sites, as the land is planted with heirloom tomatoes, beets, carrots, potatoes, gourmet lettuces, herbs and melons. When the crop comes in, produce is sold to some of the city\u2019s most stylish restaurants: Frontera Grill, Scoozi, Mod and the Ritz-Carlton. Chefs rave about the quality of the handpicked heirloom tomatoes, often harvested just hours before their use.\n\nProceeds from these sales are used, in part, to allow for the additional sale of City Farm produce to neighborhood residents at much lower prices. In deciding which crops to plant, neighborhood tastes are taken into account.\n\nWhen the land is sold, City Farm rolls up the compost, soil and fencing, and relocates. The city of Chicago currently has about eighty thousand vacant lots.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
