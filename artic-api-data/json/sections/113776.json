Details can be discerned with the aid of infrared reflectography (see fig. 1). The composition is a coherent whole. A hybrid cannon-animal, like those in Jacques Callot\u2019s etching The Temptation of Saint Anthony, hovers above the scene (see fig. 2; see also sheet 3B). At center right, a creature resembling a warthog extends across to sheet 4D, as if intended to make a visual link, and flames extend from sheet 5C below. The sheet was visibly trimmed along its left edge. At center is a multitiered structure with colonnades, reminiscent of the building in Ensor\u2019s print Capture of a Strange Town (fig. 3). Engulfed in flames and smoke, it appears to be under attack from an apocalyptic phalanx of fantastic flying creatures, one of which carries a tattered red-and-blue-striped flag (an allusion perhaps to the French flag). The building is also similar in its lower stories to the Gothic Brussels Town Hall (1402\u201320; see fig. 4), located on the Grand Place not far from the Academy of Fine Arts, where Ensor studied in the late 1870s. In 1830 the provisional government assembled at the Town Hall, provoking the separation of the Southern Provinces from the Netherlands and the formation of the modern Belgian state. The top of the structure in the drawing resembles the tiered dome of the Palace of Justice designed by Joseph Poelaert and inaugurated on October 15, 1883 (see fig. 5). SMC/KJN\n\nThe action in sheets 3A, 3B, 3C, 3A, 4B, and 4C is the source of the engraving Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels (fig. 6). It also indirectly inspired other etchings, such as The Terrible Archer (fig. 7), Cataclysms (fig. 8), Wizards in a Squall (fig. 9), and The Elephant\u2019s Joke (fig. 10). Although Devils Thrashing Angels and Archangels is not a direct reproduction of these sheets, the chaotic composition and frightful elements are similar to Saint Anthony\u2019s torments. Many motifs appear in both the print and the drawing, for example, the hot-air balloon, train, sawfish, headless bodies, octopi, insects, elephant, and submarine.\n\nIn the drawing the chaos is somewhat contained by the use of schematic registers, but in the etching Ensor dispensed with the organizational structure and allowed the chaos to become overwhelming. Sources of inspiration for the chaos include The Fall of the Rebel Angels by Pieter Bruegel I (fig. 11); versions of the temptation after Pieter Bruegel (fig. 12), by Martin Schongauer (fig. 13), and by Jacques Callot (fig. 14); and battle scenes by the Japanese artists Utagawa Kuniyoshi and Utagawa Kunisada (fig. 15 and fig. 16). These artists provided ideas about overlapping, clashing compositions that Ensor assimilated into his own work. He interpreted these sources to offer viewers a distilled representation that condenses the energy, imagination, anxiety, and virulence of its predecessors. Thanks to this synthesis, the image possesses its own logic and magic that captivates even as it amuses and overwhelms viewers with its detail.
