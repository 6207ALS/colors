    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: So this is a painting that shows his son Clovis beside a large wood tankard. And here he\u2019s using it to set the mood along with this wallpaper, which has this sort of lyrical musical quality to it. It\u2019s part of the dreamscape that he\u2019s created for his young son. And he first shows it in a still life. He\u2019s setting it up and he\u2019s fascinated by the shape, by the way light\u2019s catching it. And he\u2019s setting up kind of a dialogue of sorts with this heavy wooden tankard and this smaller pewter pitcher. For he didn\u2019t consider ordinary objects ordinary at all. For him they have a very special meaning. And he will continue to sort of fixate on objects, and figures, and motifs that inspire him and these  will appear in his works throughout his career.</p>\n<p>ALLISON PERELMEN: Walking further into the gallery you will see a large wooden cabinet. Here Gauguin is engaging with something he will do for the rest of his career: taking a found object and making it his own by carving into the surface, by adding decorative elements, painting them. Here, he is takes an elegant piece of furniture and deliberately makes it more crude with his rough carvings and mix of design elements. And although he\u2019d likely did not construct this cabinet himself, he signed it \u201cGauguin Fecit\u201d, which is Latin for \u201cGauguin made this,\u201d to make clear that this wasn\u2019t just a piece of furniture but an artwork in its own right.<br>\u2003</p>\n",
