    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Adam and Eve turn toward each other in this wonderful pair of Renaissance panels. They were painted in the 1530s, by Lucas Cranach the Elder, who was court painter to the ruler of Saxony in Germany. Cranach's paintings are known for their courtly elegance, here we see this in the graceful, flowing outlines of Adam and Eve's bodies. Notice how Cranach deepens this effect by depicting their pale bodies against dark green foliage. We might wonder what kind of setting this pair of panels was intended for. Martha Wolff is the Eleanor Wood Prince Curator of European painting before 1750.<br>Martha Wolff:  Is it a moral guide? Is it in the tradition of the power of women? Because after all, Eve is the one who took the first bite of the apple and she's about to hand it to Adam. So there's something both moralizing and slightly provocative about the way he treats these figures. They were obviously meant to go quite close together, because the tree that-- the tree of the knowledge and good and evil, is divided between the two panels, and so is mean to be seen as continuous. So they were probably just used as a pair, perhaps in a humanist library.</p>\n",
