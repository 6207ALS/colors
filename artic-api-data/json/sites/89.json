    "description": "Magritte: The Mystery of the Ordinary, 1926\u20141938 focuses on Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s breakthrough Surrealist years, peeling back the layers of this inventive and experimental period in the artist\u2019s career to reveal the development of the themes and motifs that make his art so unforgettable. Each of Magritte\u2019s enigmatic works encourages viewers to think and search deeply, and in the case of the Art Institute\u2019s iconic Time Transfixed, that kind of probing investigation revealed surprising twists and turns in the making of painting.",
