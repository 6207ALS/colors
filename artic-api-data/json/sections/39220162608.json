This depiction of a fashionably dressed Parisian was completed around 1882, when Manet\u2019s health was failing and he was spending more and more time outside Paris convalescing. Pastel, with its ease of handling, was ideal for this period of his career. The medium requires less preparation and drying time than oil and can be taken up quickly. This work reflects the circumstances of Manet\u2019s compromised health; he seemingly completed it in just a few sessions, employing quick gestural strokes of dark and earth-toned pastel. Unlike the delicate, airy portraits that appear among the pastels the artist included in his 1880 exhibition at the gallery of La Vie Moderne, the man portrayed here defies identification as a specific individual. A careful reading of the composition, however, does reveal a portrait of a particular type of urban modernity and fashion, masculinity, and class.\n\nManet depicts this man wearing a top hat and a large overcoat trimmed with fur; his crisp white collar and necktie, perhaps fastened with a jeweled pin, is articulated with just a few pastel strokes, allowing the ground layer to show through (fig. 21.1). His coat, known as a pelisse (fig. 21.2), is the fur-trimmed or -lined version of the voluminous outer garment called a paletot, which was sometimes criticized as a \u201csack.\u201d The simplified shape of these broad woolen coats, compared to the more fitted frock coat called a redingote, signaled an egalitarian trend then current in fashionable male dress, while the addition of fur revealed a shift toward more subtle, hidden luxury among late nineteenth-century bourgeois gentlemen. Manet rendered the thick, luxurious fur collar of the man\u2019s coat in browns, dark green, and touches of earthy red using the pointed end of the pastel stick, and carefully blended these marks with a stump (see Compositional Development in the technical report). The artist used a damp blending technique in a few areas, which gives the fur an almost velvety appearance (fig. 21.3). The resulting golden-brown hue and textured amplitude suggest that this fur may be that of a wolf (see, for example, fig. 21.4). The overall bulky shape of the coat suggests that it may be fully fur-lined, like that worn by writer and art critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier (fig. 21.5). Manet himself appreciated fur: in about 1880, he gushed over a coat worn by his friend, the actress and demimondaine M\u00e9ry Laurent: \u201cI\u2019ll paint M\u00e9ry Laurent as Autumn. . . . She\u2019s had a fur-trimmed pelisse made by [the couturier] Worth. And what a coat! It\u2019s fawn-brown with an old-gold lining and I was in raptures over it\u201d (fig. 21.6; [RW I 393]).\n\nThe quality of the accessories worn by the man in Manet\u2019s pastel, from the jeweled pin in his cravat to his silk top hat, all further indicate his class and status. His top hat, for example, gleams in such a way as to suggest black silk and is of moderate height, which was the fashion from about the 1870s through the 1880s (fig. 21.7). It may be shorter than the stovepipe hats favored earlier in the century, but it clearly features a curved brim. Manet himself often wore a top hat, as his friend Antonin Proust noted when describing the conclusion of a visit: \u201cManet stood up after having brushed and replaced his top hat on his head. For, in the country as well as in the city, he was invariably dressed in a jacket or a tight-waisted frock coat, a light-colored pair of trousers, and he wore a very high hat with a flat brim.\u201d In Henri Fantin-Latour\u2019s 1867 portrait of the artist, he does appear to wear the type of hat described by Proust (fig. 21.8). In Manet\u2019s own 1880 portrait of Proust (fig. 21.9; [RW I 331]), the top hat is of the same up-to-date variety, with a curved brim, as that seen in The Man with the Dog. Along with the top hat, other details in the portraits of Manet and Proust contribute to the sitter\u2019s dapper appearance: their properly knotted ties, the crisp white of their collars, their leather gloves, and their walking sticks. In the Chicago pastel, some of these same details\u2014the jeweled cravat pin and top hat\u2014virtually ensure that the man depicted comes across as a well-dressed gentleman, while the exclusion of other accessories, such as the gloves, can be explained by the sketchy, unfinished quality of the composition.\n\nFurthermore, these portraits reveal the expressive force of beards in fin-de-si\u00e8cle fashion. As the art and costume historian Charles Blanc noted, \u201c[W]e must not forget what expression there is in the cut of the beard, mustache, sideburns, and hair.\u201d When Adolphe Tabarant described The Man with the Dog, he took special care to note the man\u2019s \u201cmoustache et forte barbe\u201d (moustache and strong beard). In addition to simply having a beard, a particular indicator of a man of fashion was the length of his beard. The Journal des modes (1874) suggested that \u201cladies generally like to see a beard on a man\u2019s face,\u201d but warned that it should not be too long, which would be an un-Parisian look that would not \u201cagree with modern costume.\u201d The length of the man\u2019s beard in the pastel seems to be in the fashionable range\u2014comparable to Proust\u2019s beard in Manet\u2019s 1880 portrait of his friend (fig. 21.9). Manet\u2019s handling of the beard in the pastel is akin to that of the fur collar, utilizing a similar blending technique. The artist also employed a similar tonal scheme of dark green and brown as well as dark gray and light gray, adding to the distinguished quality of the figure (fig. 21.1).\n\nMoving away from the main figure and his clothing, we quickly encounter another sign of wealth and privilege: his dog companion. Dogs that were kept as household pets were signs of social status at this time, as was the mere act of walking a dog, whether in the city (see fig. 21.10) or out in a country estate (see fig. 21.11). Manet himself had an affinity for dogs and painted several portraits of them, perhaps most notably a sensitively rendered portrait of a King Charles spaniel (fig. 21.12; [RW I 233]). In the Chicago pastel, for all of Manet\u2019s delight in the fur collar of the man\u2019s coat, Manet depicted the dog\u2019s fur quickly and cursorily, with diagonal hatch-like strokes of gray and black (fig. 21.13). The artist delineated a leash in more delicate red and yellow pastel, probably at the same time as the man\u2019s face, hat, and shirt (see Technical Report). Although the dog\u2019s lack of definition makes it impossible to identify its breed, the animal does in a way mirror the primary figure: a big, furry dog standing next to his owner, with his bushy beard and broad winter coat with fur collar. The human and animal pair here stands in stark contrast to the sleek and refined Vicomte Lepic with his almost aristocratic greyhound in Edgar Degas\u2019s Place de la Concorde (1875; fig. 21.14): the elegant dog a clear avatar of the viscount in his tan overcoat and top hat with curved brim.\n\nThis pastel represents a brief treatment even for an artist known for his ability to represent essential details with the most summary means (see, for example, cat. 19). Some details, such as the man\u2019s hands, are only roughly suggested or barely outlined, while other areas display little outline or delineation; for instance, the front legs of the dog seem to merge into the man\u2019s left leg in a blur of dark hatched pastel stokes. Further, this unresolved pair is placed in a nondescript setting, without any landmarks to locate them in a specific venue or even a firm position on the ground. Technical examination suggests that Manet may have blended several colors from his palette to produce this background, adding some light brown at the bottom of the composition, perhaps to suggest the ground or pavement (see Compositional Development in the technical report). The transmitted-light image indicates that the figures of the man and his dog were added before the background was completed (fig. 21.15; see Compositional Development in the technical report). A slight halo effect is visible, particularly at the man\u2019s proper left shoulder, where a small gap remains between the coat and the background. In these sketchiest areas the ground is clearly visible, as is the texture of the plain weave linen canvas that Manet used for this pastel. The unfinished, sketchy quality of the male figure makes identification very difficult, if not impossible. One of Manet\u2019s early biographers believed the subject to be Baron Rene-Jean Toussaint, a man-about-town and writer who published under the pseudonym of Ren\u00e9 Maizeroy. Baron Toussaint knew the artist and in 1882 published a witty description of a visit to his studio. This identification may have originated from an annotation on the Lochard photocard that was part of an inventory project following Manet\u2019s death (fig. 21.16). The veracity of this identification is difficult to substantiate, however, particularly in light of a contemporary pastel portrait in which Manet rendered his fashionable male subject with a full-figure view in a similarly undefined space (fig. 21.17; [RW II 68]). Dressed in a dapper bluish-gray checked suit with a brown overcoat draped over one arm and a cane in his other hand, this figure\u2019s facial features clearly identify him as Ren\u00e9 Maizeroy, particularly when compared to a roughly contemporary photograph of the man himself (fig. 21.18).\n\nSetting aside the matter of identification, however, it is worth observing that in both pastels Manet focuses on clothing, posture, and accessories in a manner reminiscent of fashion plates. Commercial illustrations and fashion plates of masculine attire appeared in contemporary journals such as the Journal des tailleurs and Le progr\u00e8s, and featured fashions that changed with every season (fig. 21.19 and fig. 21.20). Manet was very interested in these kinds of visual culture, which inspired many of his late, single-figure paintings and pastels.\n\nBy the 1880s Manet was known primarily as \u201ca painter of fashionable women.\u201d This pastel clearly belongs to another category of Manet\u2019s late work and indicates his wider interests, which included not only women, with their \u00e0 la mode fashion, but also the minutiae of male fashion and, by extension, modern, urban masculinity.  \nHelen Burnham and Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet executed The Man with the Dog on a pre-primed no. 10 marine standard-size linen canvas with an off-white ground likely applied by a colorman.\n\nThe composition is rendered entirely in pastel. Manet employed a variety of techniques including gestural strokes, hatching, and dry and wet blending. He evidently worked on the figures first and then moved on to the background.\n\nPastel\n\nMan with the Dog is on a no. 10 horizontal marine standard-size canvas. The canvas is visually estimated to be a fine, plain weave linen. The horizontal threads correspond to the weft and the vertical threads to the warp. Cusping, associated with the tacks that hold the canvas on the stretcher, is present along all four edges, but is most apparent along the right and bottom edges.\n\nThe canvas appears to be on its original stretcher (fig. 21.21): it is trimmed to the outer edges of the stretcher and folded into tidy hospital corners along the vertical edges. The tacking edges are only mildly deteriorated, with a few tears to the edges of the fabric. There is only one set of tack holes. All tacks are present, except for the one that was third from the bottom on the left side and the one that was at the center of the bottom edge. The tack heads are coated with a hard and shiny black paint or varnish (fig. 21.22).\n\nThe four-membered stretcher has a single horizontal crossbar. The outer members are beveled on the canvas side so that the textile does not come into contact with the stretcher. Another bevel is present on the side that would face the wall, presumably in order to better fit the artwork into a frame. Ten keys are present. No manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were noted on the stretcher, but a small paper label on the stretcher at upper right on the top member appears to read \u201c7-\u201d. Other notations on the stretcher also seem to be limited to numbers. These are in grease pencil or crayon and occur under the remnants of paper dust covers. Of these the only readable inscription is \u201c119\u201d and appears at upper left.\n\nMicroscopic examination of the scraped area below the stamp at lower right on the front of the painting reveals a coating on the canvas fibers. This appears to be the sizing, which has the visual characteristics of glue. A cross-section of the ground layer taken from the bottom tacking margin includes a layer of glue size.\n\nThe linen is primed with an off-white (slightly gray) ground. Analysis of the ground indicates that it is composed primarily of lead white in an oil medium. Although canvases prepared with a gritty ground designed specifically for use with pastels could be purchased from artist\u2019s suppliers, it appears that Manet used a canvas prepared with a ground suitable for oil painting. On the top, right, and bottom edges the ground extends to the edge of the tacking margins. On the left, the ground ends in an uneven line slightly short of the edge of the canvas. This indicates that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, and that the left edge was attached to a priming frame and thus received less ground. The work has an average thread count (standard deviation) of 31.0V (0.7) \u00d7 32.1H (0.9) threads/cm. The horizontal threads correspond to the weft and the vertical threads to the warp. There is a warp-thread match between this work and Portrait of Alphonse Maureau (cat. 18), which suggests that the canvases were cut from the same bolt of cloth.\n\n55.0 \u00d7 35.0 cm (21 5/8 \u00d7 13 3/4 in.)\n\nStamped: EM (lower right corner, in red ink) (fig. 21.23).\n\nManet appears to have completed The Man with the Dog in a few sessions, and there is little evidence that he substantially changed the composition once he began to work. He started by laying in the outlines of the forms with quick gestural stokes in a dark pastel. Many of these lines are still present along the man\u2019s pelisse (coat) and shoes and the back of the dog (fig. 21.24). With the foundations of the composition in place, Manet built up the figures with multiple layers of a subdued palette of grays, browns, dark green, and blacks. He worked in an additive manner, using the pastel in stick form, sometimes blending dry pastel with a stump, and sometimes dampening the pastel to create a subtle change in texture.\n\nThe rapid speed at which Manet worked on the dog is evident in its diagonal hatching strokes from gray and black pastel sticks. Compared to the dog, the man\u2019s figure received more time and attention. The pastel applications in these areas were blended, but Manet probably began modeling the overcoat in the arms and torso with diagonal hatching, too; remnants of this hatching can be seen in the proper right sleeve. Manet laid in the body of the pelisse with broad vertical pastel strokes, possibly applied by drawing the sides of pastel sticks downward in repeated applications. The lighter areas of the black pelisse have a smooth texture and may have been partially created with pastel wash\u2014pastel that has been ground up and mixed with water and applied with a brush. The darker areas of the pelisse under the proper right sleeve and along the left side of the body and outside of the proper left sleeve are composed of blended pastel. The fur collar of the overcoat is rendered in browns, a dark green, and touches of an earthy red. The colors were laid in with the point of a pastel stick and carefully blended with a stump.\n\nFor the finer details in the face, hat, and shirt, Manet appears to have used sharpened pastel sticks or possibly pastel pencils. Blending is present in the hat and beard, but the skin tones and shirt are composed of a few dashes of pinks, blues, and white (fig. 21.25). The dog\u2019s leash was apparently added at this time. It consists of quick strokes of red and a dark earthy yellow.\n\nThe background was applied last. As in Beggar with Oysters (Philosopher) (cat. 10) and Beggar with Duffle Coat (Philosopher) (cat.11), Manet appears to have blended several colors to produce a featureless background with brown tone in the bottom quadrant to suggest the ground or pavement. There is a slight halo of blank canvas around the man\u2019s left arm and leg and the dog, and the blue-gray background at right crosses the line delineating the back of the dog. The halo is best seen in transmitted light (fig. 21.26). Manet was largely successful at blending the background at proper left with the outline of the pelisse. Unlike the blending work in the overcoat itself, there are numerous fingerprints in the background, mostly clustered around the head of the man, but with a few at lower left as well.\n\nThe ink estate stamp in the lower right corner would have been easily removed if it had been applied to loose pastel. Therefore, the area where it is applied was prepared in advance, scraped with a sharp blade (possibly a knife or palette knife) to remove pastel and some ground (see fig. 21.23).\n\nTo protect the delicate pastel from abrasion from the frame and glazing, thin wooden spacers were nailed though the front of the canvas. It is not known when these were attached to the pastel. The spacers measure 5 \u00d7 5 mm and run the length of the top, bottom, and left edges. The spacer on the right edge is made of two separate lengths, with the longer length (39.7 cm) extending from the top edge down, and the shorter length (15 cm) filling the remaining space. The spacers are toned with a gray-brown paint, visually estimated to be watercolor, on the edges next to the picture plane. The nails are placed a few centimeters from the corners and at the center of each wooden strip. On the bottom tacking margin, the center nail failed to penetrate the wood. It appears to be 1.5 cm in length and approximately 1 mm diameter. It is covered with layer of red corrosion (rust).\n\nThe artwork was examined on its arrival at the Art Institute of Chicago in 2007, and all the condition issues noted at that time are present today. Aside from those mentioned above, outstanding condition issues include a scratch in the upper right corner, old and inactive mold growth on the gray pastel, a small water stain along the lower edge, and pinpoint losses and flaking of the pastel. The pastel loss has occurred predominantly along the proud threads of the warp, and in the heaviest areas of media application. It appears to be exacerbated by the oil-based ground. Microscopic examination reveals delamination and flake losses in the heavy areas of application, mostly around the head (fig. 21.27). This area also contains several fingerprints, perhaps indicative of reworking by Manet or another hand.\n\nAt one point a corrugated board covered the back of the stretcher (fig. 21.28). Probably added early in the twentieth century, the board served a protective purpose and prevented puncture of the canvas from the verso.  \nRachel Freeman\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">By descent from the artist to his wife, Suzanne Manet (n\u00e9e Leenhoff; 1829\u20131906), Paris, Apr. 30, 1883.\n\nSold by Suzanne Manet at H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Feb. 4\u20135, 1884, lot 120, to de la Narde, for 95 francs.\n\nCarvalho, Paris, by 1902.\n\nTh\u00e9odore Duret (1838\u20131927), Paris.\n\nAuguste Pellerin (1853\u20131929), Paris, by 1902.\n\nProbably sold by Auguste Pellerin to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, spring 1910.\n\nLefevre Galleries (Alex.

It is possible that this is Octavie Josephine Macedo-Carvalho (1833\u20131909; n\u00e9e Marchand). She was the mistress of the important art dealer and collector George Aloysius Lucas (1824\u20131909), who moved to Paris in 1857. He maintained her apartment across the hall from his own, and the two shared a servant. Reportedly, cooking for both households was done in Lucas\u2019s apartment, as Carvalho\u2019s kitchen was stuffed with Lucas\u2019s art collection. Therefore, it is possible that someone knew the picture was in Carvalho\u2019s apartment but never made the connection to George A. Lucas. See Holly Selby and James Bock, \u201cLucas\u2019 Will, The Fight over George A. Lucas Collection Comes Down to One Question: Does the Lucas art belong in Baltimore forever?

In addition to assembling his own significant collection of Manet prints, Lucas helped Samuel P. Avery (1822\u20131904) and William T. Walters (1820\u20131894) form their collections. Avery amassed a collection of 17,775 etchings and lithographs representing 978 artists, many of them French, and gave his collection of prints to the New York Public Library in 1900. Following his death in 1894, Walters bequeathed bequeathed his extensive collection to his son, Henry Walters, who established the Walters Art Gallery, now called The Walters Art Museum, in Baltimore, Maryland.\n\nAdolphe Tabarant, Manet: Histoire catalographique (Montaigne, 1931), pp. 507\u201308, no. 85.\n\nTh\u00e9odore Duret, Histoire d\u2019\u00c9douard Manet et de son oeuvre (H.

In spring 1910 Pellerin sold much of his Manet collection to a consortium of art dealers comprised of Bernheim-Jeune and Durand-Ruel, both in Paris, and Paul Cassirer, in Berlin. See Julius Meier-Graefe, Kunst ist nicht f\u00fcr Kunstgeschichte da: Briefe und Dokumente, ed. Catherine Krahmer (Wallstein, 2001), p. 374. In June of that year, Bernheim-Jeune exhibited thirty-five works by Manet from the Pellerin collection. See Bernheim-Jeune, Manet: Trente-cinq tableaux de la collection Pellerin (Paris, 1910). This pastel was not included, but another pastel portrait, L\u2019Homme Blond (Duret no. 75) was shown. If Pellerin had still owned The Man with the Dog at that time, it seems likely that it, too, would have been included.\n\nAdolphe Tabarant, Manet: Histoire catalographique (Montaigne, 1931), pp. 507\u201308, no. 85.\n\nLondon, Lefevre Galleries, Important Pictures by Nineteenth Century French Masters, May\u2013June 1924 (ill.).\n\nStock card, Bignou Gallery Album, Frick Collection Archives, copy provided by Shannon Morelli, Jan. 28, 2016, in the curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAdolphe Tabarant, Manet: Histoire catalographique (Montaigne, 1931), pp. 507\u201308, no. 85.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u00c9douard Manet 1832\u20131883 (Art Institute of Chicago, 1967), n. pag., cat. 197 (ill.).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 21 The Man with the Dog, c. 1882.\n\nfig. 21.23 Detail of Manet\u2019s The Man with the Dog (c. 1882) showing the red stamp reading EM in the lower right corner, which was applied after some ground was removed with a sharp blade.
