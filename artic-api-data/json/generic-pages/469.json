But what tools does one use when the artwork at the center of art-historical research becomes inaccessible?   As fellows in the museum this year, under the aegis of the Chicago Objects Study Initiative, we spent the first months of our fellowship devoted to an art-historical approach centered on objects. In the context of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to pursue the projects we initiated. However, in response to the physical distancing that the pandemic demanded of us, we reorganized our toolkit, as COVID-19 has reorganized so much else.   We have developed new tools and strategies, turning to digital resources, replicas, and simulations of processes of making to advance our research. We have also looked at existing materials differently\u2014both tangible materials, such as conservation documents, and intangible materials, such as the memories and affective experiences of artworks that can be summoned up long after our physical encounters with them. The Empty Gallery compiles a group of objects that we have been researching under these new conditions. We invite you to explore.   Object Studies ",
