The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's Museums at Home series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based Art Insights conversations on a national scale. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>It has been written that \"art is continually haunted by the animal.\" Artists across time represent the wild kingdom and our familiar companions in sport, leisure, labor, play, and prowl. Art Institute of Chicago volunteer lecturer Laura Davis leads a lively conversation about depictions and interpretations of animals in art.</p><p>This virtual presentation is hosted by Well Connected, a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who connect via phone- or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p><p><strong>*For more information or to register, please call (877) 797-7299, email </strong><a href=\"mailto:coviaconnections@covia.org\"><strong>coviaconnections@covia.org</strong></a><strong>, or visit&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://covia.org/services/well-connected/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>covia.org/services/well-connected</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>",
