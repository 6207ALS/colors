Bowl or dish fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves the wall of a large, deep bowl with heavy vertical ribs. The mosaic pattern is formed from sections of three polygonal canes; one in deep blue with ten white dots around a central yellow dot; two canes in amethyst with nine white dots around a central yellow dot; a third fragmentary cane appears to be an aquamarine matrix with white dots.\n\nThe fragment preserves the lower part of a large vertical rib on the exterior of a deep bowl. The interior is repolished with isolated pitting. There is a light-brown weathering crust and some silvery iridescence on the back and all edges.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 91 Fragment of a Vessel, 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
