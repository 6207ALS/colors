    "description": "<p>The Hindu goddess Durga. slayer of the buffalo demon Mahesha (Mahishasuramardini), appears in rhythmic succession 12 times in this pair of manuscript covers from Nepal. In this myth the gods, unable to defeat a powerful shape-changing demon in the form of a water buffalo, decide to create a goddess who\u2014with their combined weapons, energy, and strength\u2014will be able to vanquish it. Whirling her arms and brandishing her weapons, the goddess stabs the demon with her lance in one lower hand and lifts him up by the tail with another. Her right foot stands upon her trademark vehicle, shown as a snow lion in Nepal, while her left foot crushes the demon\u2019s back. As she does so, a human form emerges from the animal\u2019s neck. In an expressive detail, the buffalo\u2019s severed head droops below the picture frame. In Nepal Durga is often called \u201cBhagwati,\u201d and she is worshipped annually in an autumn festival in both India and Nepal.</p>\n",
