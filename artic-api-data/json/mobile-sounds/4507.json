    "transcript": "<p>Gloria Groom: This is a very odd thing to run into in this room with portraits of women in very fashionable attire, with letters, but it really speaks to his time away from Paris.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Manet was spending more and more time in the countryside for treatment and rest. As a result, Manet was forced to search for new subject matter in his surroundings. Curator, Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>Gloria: Because he didn\u2019t have a studio, he didn\u2019t have the friends visiting him, he had no cafes. And so I think he\u2019s kind of looking around at these more domestic, mundane objects, and thinking about the tradition of still life painting. It also fits into Manet\u2019s increasing interest in making paintings that related to the interior that were to decorate the interior, that were considered decorative panels.</p>\n<p>Narrator: The hierarchy between the fine arts of painting and sculpture and the domestic arts had started to break down, and more and more artists were seeing decorative arts as a new means of expression. Here, Manet uses vertical composition to make this painting ideal for fitting into the panels of a home.</p>\n<p>One might also consider how Manet would have been spending far more time in-doors by this point in his life. Considering how to bring beauty and life into the interior of a home may not have been just an intellectual interest, but also a necessity for continuing his painting practice.</p>\n",
