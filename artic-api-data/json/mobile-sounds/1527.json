    "transcript": "<p>DENISE MAHONEY:  I think what's wonderful about this piece, is as you go around it and you look-- you're a witness to an evening out in New York, New York City.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute's Denise Mahoney.</p>\n<p>DENISE MAHONEY: The artist was recalling an evening he spent at the Cotton Club when he was designing this bowl.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Take a stroll through the city night, as you walk around this bowl. Notice the street lamps and the neon signs, look for skyscrapers and a stoplight. That big object that looks like a fan? It's the Wurlitzer organ at Radio City Music Hall. The style is an energetic mix of cubism and popular imagery.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: And you can almost hear the music that inspired the designer, Viktor Schreckengost.</p>\n<p>DENISE MAHONEY:  What I think makes the piece sort of humorous, is that you see champagne glasses, liquor bottles. And you have to think that it was still Prohibition when this bowl was being made.. for the governor of New York. And yet the artist still felt it was okay to include references to alcohol in this jazz bowl.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: That's right. This punch bowl was a gift to celebrate the reelection of the governor of New York State, future president Franklin Delano Roosevelt. And it was commissioned by his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>\n",
