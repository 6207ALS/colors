    "description": "<p>This landscape was attributed to the Northern Song court painter Guo Xi (c. 1001-c. 1090) by the authors of early 20th-century colophons that accompany the painting. The depiction of figures gazing out from two water pavilions at the foot of a rocky outcrop\u2014as well as a dramatic clusters of old pine-trees and billowing, restless forms of mountain-ridges that rise from valleys into the high distance\u2014are all features associated with Guo Xi\u2019s iconic landscapes. The relatively looser composition and hybrid brushwork, however, point to a Yuan re-interpretation of this Northern Song style.  A seal on the painting that may be associated with a Yuan scholar named Wu Fang supports this fourteenth-century date.</p>\n",
