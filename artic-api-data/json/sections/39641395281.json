In this first-state impression, previously unidentified in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints, the artist had yet to remove a diagonal line above the word Taiti in the upper right corner of the composition. In the lower right there are two tree branches; a bird is perched on each branch. In the second state, a portion of the lower branch of the tree has been removed so that both birds now sit on a single branch (fig. 112.1.2). Gauguin also made a small alteration to the shape of the horse\u2019s tail.\n\nThis headpiece appears at the top of the title page of the December 1899 issue of Le sourire (fig. 112.1.3). Gauguin produced nine issues of Le sourire. The December 1899 issue was the fifth and did not contain a supplement. It is in this issue where Gauguin first changed the word s\u00e9rieux to m\u00e9chant (\u201cwicked\u201d) in the subtitle.\n\nGauguin adhered an impression of this print on page 176 of his Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 112.1.4), which suggests that it held particular significance for him.\n\nThis impression was printed in black ink.\n\nGauguin used card stock from another publication or portfolio containing photographs taken by Gustav Arosa, as evidenced by a printed inscription that includes \u201cG. Arosa. St. C[loud]\u201d and \u201cD\u00e9pos\u00e9e.\u201d There is a plate mark that is visible on all sides and is more or less centered in the sheet. It is a distinct mark that is unrelated to the wood-block print. The edges of the sheet were trimmed on all sides.\n\nThe combination of a stiff card stock on the surface of an unevenly inked wood block resulted in an irregularly printed impression.\n\n142 \u00d7 221 mm (image); 168 \u00d7 245 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print was examined in anticipation of exhibition in 2003. No treatment was undertaken. On the verso, the sheet is abraded along the top where it was attached to secondary supports in the past.\n\nThe print is in good condition. The paper tone has altered over time. Three distinct bands of discoloration related to the placement of window mats are visible along the edges. There is residue of black printing ink and transferred bright pink media on the verso.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
