    "title": "Jordan Casteel's Barack",
    "copy": " In her signature portraits of people she encounters in her everyday sphere, Jordan Casteel bridges portraiture with abstraction, often highlighting attributes that make her subjects unique in that moment and as people in the world\u2014from wrinkles and veins in hands to folds and creases in clothes. Instead of a paintbrush, Casteel begins with a camera. She takes at times hundreds of photographs\u2014in homes, on the city streets, on the subway\u2014and tapes them around her canvas, treating them like scores for a more improvisational method. Her approach allows portraiture to become an empathic medium for giving visibility to ordinary pedestrians, students, friends, and family, offering the opportunity to linger on the appearances and manners of people who feel familiar, whether we know them or not.   While Barack, her portrait of the former president, is somewhat of an outlier in her oeuvre as a painting of an iconic individual, Casteel\u2019s insightful depiction is a material testament to Obama\u2019s return to ordinary life after presidency. This is emphasized by the work\u2019s casual first-name attribution, which reflects the artist\u2019s standard title treatment. Casteel painted Barack to accompany Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s exclusive interview with the former president in the Atlantic , \u201cWhy Obama Fears for Our Democracy\u201d (November 16, 2020). Like all of her portraits, it stems from a photograph\u2014however, in this case, not one taken by the artist herself. Rather, the painting is an expressive reinterpretation of an official White House photograph. Reflecting on the engagement, Casteel expressed, \u201cI don\u2019t think I fully understood what taking that time would do. What it would mean for me to see and transcribe. [President Obama] is, in many ways, all of us. The distance between us was lessened through the act of making this painting . . .\". As Casteel acutely demonstrates in this portrait and throughout her work, \u201cThere is another level of \u2018knowing\u2019 that occurs when you take the time to paint the likeness of someone.\u201d   Casteel's painting, featuring the president\u2019s face resting in the palm of his accentuated hand, emphasizes Obama\u2019s contemplative pose. Barack demonstrates the way in which Casteel uses the photograph as a vehicle for making contact through thick, layered brushstrokes, caringly, at times disproportionately, rendering the human form with a sense of closeness and immediacy. This most tender take on a presidential portrait complements this summer's exhibition The Obama Portraits , featuring works by Amy Sherald and Kehinde Wiley. And Casteel herself has a surprising historical connection to both the Obamas and to Chicago\u2014former First Lady Michelle Obama is a graduate of Whitney M. Young Magnet High School on the Near West Side, named after Casteel's grandfather, the civil rights leader and executive director of the National Urban League. You can find Casteel's Barack on view now in Gallery 295 of the Modern Wing. \u2014Jordan Carter, associate curator, Modern and Contemporary Art   Hear directly from artist Jordan Casteel in this short audio piece.
