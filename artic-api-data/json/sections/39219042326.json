A promising young painter, Maureau had died a few days earlier at the municipal hospital known as the Maison Dubois, leaving behind his wife, Mary, and little else. Although his works were occasionally praised in his time for a fine sense of color and light, only a few survive today. He is sometimes mentioned in connection with the Impressionists as a friend of Degas, who introduced him to the group and shared a family connection to New Orleans, Maureau\u2019s birthplace. However, Maureau is probably best remembered as the subject of a pastel portrait by Manet in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pastel depicts Maureau in a dapper outfit, sitting at a table and holding a small glass of beer. In the background, what appear to be diaphanous white curtains with light gray squiggly (possibly floral) embellishments cover a window with a frame outlined in gray. The blue strokes through the white suggest either light through the window or a stripe in the curtain, and echo the intense blue of Maureau\u2019s waistcoat.\n\nManet paid considerable attention to this outfit, using soft strokes of pastel\u2014alternating broad strokes with more pointed applications of the edge of the stick\u2014to define the crisp white collar and blue waistcoat, and to highlight the loosely knotted necktie (lavalli\u00e8re) with tartan checks. A round hat set at a debonair angle completes the jaunty ensemble. For Maureau\u2019s assertive (almost rakish) moustache, Manet blended the pastel in areas to create a more complex depth of tone onto which he layered narrow strokes of light-brown, medium-brown, and dark-brown pastel (fig. 18.1, see Compositional Development in the technical report). The artist signed his name in a similarly dashing manner at a perpendicular angle to the composition, along the curtain on the right side of the picture as if it is floating out of Maureau\u2019s glass (fig. 18.2).\n\nUpon his death, Maureau\u2019s contemporaries described him as a painter and praised his skill. In 1880 the critic Paul Mantz noted the unfortunate early death of this new member of the Impressionist circle, who \u201cpainted the banks of the Seine . . . in the light of a true ray of sun.\u201d Maureau\u2019s subjects included plein air scenes of boats and animals along the banks of the river Seine, and Parisian sights such as the Boulevard Clichy and the place Pigalle. He was, however, less accomplished than promising, and that in a rather conventional way, judging by the taste of the critics who praised him in the press.\n\nEighteen artists, including Maureau, exhibited in the Impressionist exhibition of 1877, and his paintings were reasonably well received as the work of a newcomer (see, for example, fig. 18.3). One critic remarked, \u201cbeautiful studies . . . they are solid, fresh, and luminous.\u201d Another suggested that these studies were \u201cthe work of an artist who is still inexperienced, but whose vision is sane and who has a fine sense of the variety and power of color.\u201d Despite this early positive reception in the press, not everyone agreed that Maureau was worthy of inclusion in the Impressionist circle. Gustave Caillebotte, in an 1881 letter to Pissarro, implied that friendship with Degas rather than Maureau\u2019s ability had granted him entry to their third exhibition. Caillebotte criticized Degas for spending his \u201ctime haranguing at the Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes or in society\u201d and, a few lines later, complained to Pissarro about the mediocre artists Degas had introduced to the group; he listed Maureau as an example along with Alphonse Legros and Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic.\n\nWhile acknowledging Maureau\u2019s reputation as a painter, the artist\u2019s contemporaries seem to have considered him also a \u201cfrequenter [habitu\u00e9] of the caf\u00e9 de la Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes\u201d (fig. 18.4). This caf\u00e9, at the place Pigalle in the ninth arrondissement of Paris, was the preferred gathering spot for Manet and his circle in the mid-to-late 1870s (fig. 18.5). Avant-garde writers such as \u00c9mile Zola and Zacharie Astruc as well as artists of the Impressionist circle\u2014including Degas, Henri Fantin-Latour, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2014met there to drink, socialize, and discuss, and to form a kind of collective identity. George Moore, the writer and bon vivant\u2014the \u201cdandy of the batignolles\u201d\u2014 described his time at the caf\u00e9 as educational and formative: \u201cI did not go to either Oxford or Cambridge, but I went to the \u2018Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes\u2019 . . . the real French academy, the caf\u00e9.\u201d Maureau lived in the neighborhood and may well have met Manet at the Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes (fig. 18.6).\n\nNot just a favorite gathering place, the Nouvelle\u2013Ath\u00e8nes figured as the setting for many compositions of contemporary Parisian life by these vanguard artists. Degas\u2019s painting In a Caf\u00e9 (The Absinthe Drinker) (fig. 18.7), for example, is set in the Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes and was a touchstone for Manet. Comparable elements can be found in his pastel portrait of Maureau, from the caf\u00e9 patron absorbed in his own thoughts to the transparent white curtains that fill the background, all suggesting that the artist completed his pastel in situ at a caf\u00e9, maybe even at the Nouvelle\u2013Ath\u00e8nes. However, technical analysis shows that the Art Institute\u2019s pastel was probably executed in multiple sittings, suggesting that the work was more likely inspired by Manet\u2019s time at the caf\u00e9 and completed in his studio. The artist built up the skin tone in the sitter\u2019s face by using several different pastel sticks and employing multidirectional strokes utilizing the pointed ends of the sticks. Manet created a velvety underlayer for the figure\u2019s hat and coat by blending several layers of pastel with a small amount of moisture, and gave shape to the lapel of the coat and top of the hat by using pointed strokes of black and brown (see Compositional Development in the technical report). Manet also likely reworked the composition: a dark shape in the lower right of the composition suggests a previous, slightly higher placement of Maureau\u2019s left sleeve (fig. 18.8). A further sign of reworking can be found just above Maureau\u2019s right shoulder, where white pastel was used to cover a darker outline. Complementing this evidence of Manet\u2019s working process, we know from George Moore that Manet had a caf\u00e9 table\u2014complete with a marble top and iron legs\u2014in his studio, where he preferred to work. While not clearly defined in the pastel, this table is recognizable in Manet\u2019s Woman Reading (cat. 19), which may also have been executed in his studio.\n\nA writer for Le gaulois, covering Maureau\u2019s funeral, noted that Manet, \u201cwho was very close to the deceased, had done his portrait, which is exhibited at this moment at La Vie Moderne, with the other works by the ex-head of Impressionism.\u201d This \u201cportrait\u201d has now been identified as the pastel at the Art Institute. The work was not explicitly listed in the catalogue for that exhibition, which had opened just a few days earlier and included twenty-five works by Manet (fig. 18.9). However, it certainly would have fit within the show due to its modern subject matter, relatively small format, and spirited technique.\n\nThe exhibition was open April 8\u201330, 1880, and took place at the offices of La Vie Moderne\u2014a new periodical focused on art, culture, fashion, and gossip, and written in the urbane spirit of modern Paris. Georges Charpentier, the great patron of Renoir and publisher of Zola, among others, was behind the journal; the exhibitions tended to reflect his family\u2019s taste for modern-life subjects. Manet\u2019s exhibition consisted of ten paintings in oil on canvas and fifteen pastels, mostly on prepared linen canvas. The latter included a number of pastel portraits, most of which have been linked conclusively to known works by Manet. Like his portrait George Moore (fig. 18.10; [RW II 11]), these pastels tend to focus on the sitter\u2019s face, head, and shoulders against a plain ground. And when Manet set his pastel figures in a defined space, he tended to produce views of social types, figures from modern Paris. Critics noticed that the show focused on drinkers in bars, alone or isolated within groups, psychologically solitary despite being surrounded by others\u2014a condition of urban life that Manet captured movingly (see, for example, fig. 18.11; [RW I 280]). If Manet did include the pastel of Maureau, then it would have been appropriate to understand it as a representation of a social type\u2014such as a \u201cdrinker\u201d\u2014rather than as a portrait of a particular individual, and title it accordingly. As mentioned earlier, technical study has revealed that the pastel was a planned effort, which supports the idea that this portrait of Maureau was part of Manet\u2019s larger project depicting modern types. Here, Maureau arguably plays two roles, that of a caf\u00e9-habitu\u00e9 and that of a drinker, two social types that were of interest to Manet in this period. Among the works included in the Vie Moderne exhibition, one of the catalogue entries, \u201c22\u2014Le Buveur\u201d (or The Drinker), has never been convincingly linked to another existing pastel by Manet. This pastel portrait of Maureau is a compelling candidate, given the subject matter. Further, when considered along with another pastel displayed in that exhibition\u2014 no. 23, Les Buveurs de bocks (The Beer Drinkers) (fig. 18.12; [RW II 7])\u2014they make a convincing pair. This other pastel features two women drinking beer before a bright white and blue background; the woman on the left sits in profile in a position similar to that of Alphonse Maureau. The background behind the two women does not read like the diaphanous curtains in the background of the earlier single portrait; but whether it is a painted wall or reflection in a mirror, the aesthetic effect is nonetheless very similar. These correspondences in colorism, composition, and subject matter reinforce our identification of the Art Institute\u2019s pastel as a pendant to this image of beer-drinking women.\n\nPerhaps because Portrait of Alphonse Maureau was never properly labeled in Manet\u2019s lifetime, the identity of the sitter and the title of the work have been a source of confusion for many years. The work was exhibited at the 1884 retrospective exhibition at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts as The Man in a Round Hat, and the sitter was mistakenly identified as \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, a collector and art historian, and also as Charpentier of La Vie Moderne. The source of this confusion is curious because he was, in fact, identified as the painter Alphonse Maureau in the photographic inventory of Manet\u2019s work that was executed following his death in 1883. Just below the photograph of this pastel is an inscription, undoubtedly made by the son of Manet\u2019s widow, Suzanne Leenhoff, which reads \u201cPortrait of Maureau, frequenter (habitu\u00e9) of the caf\u00e9 Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes\u201d (fig. 18.4).\n\nAs no date accompanies Manet\u2019s signature, it is difficult to pinpoint a firm date for this work among the wealth of late pastels produced by the artist. It seems likely that Manet executed his portrait of Maureau around 1878\u201379, given the similar techniques found in the caf\u00e9 scenes and portrait pastels of 1878\u201379 as well as evidence that Maureau\u2019s health was failing in the years leading up to his death in 1880. In 1877, just a few months after the Impressionist exhibition, Maureau had planned to go to Fontainebleau with Degas but he was forced to cancel due to a \u201csevere attack of arthritis.\u201d He died a few years later, from a \u201cphtisie pulmonaire (pulmonary tuberculosis)\u201d according to one newspaper account. This pastel remains as one of the few records of the life of Alphonse Maureau: a painter, caf\u00e9-habitu\u00e9, and member of the Impressionist circle.  \nHelen Burnham and Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Portrait of Alphonse Maureau (listed as The Man in the Round Hat in the catalogue for the 1884 exhibition of Manet\u2019s work) is executed in pastel on a canvas primed with an off-white ground. At 547 \u00d7 452 mm, the work corresponds to a standard-size no. 10 portrait (figure) canvas. A warp-thread match was determined with another pastel-on-canvas work by the artist, The Man with the Dog (cat. 21; [RW II 67]), which indicates that the canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. The composition is a complex layering of media and may have been executed over several sessions. Manet built up the painting using a variety of pastel painting techniques, including finely pointed pastel sticks, the broad side of pastel sticks, wet or dampened pastel, and blending of the media.\n\nManet used pastel for all phases of the composition. The sticks of pastel used by Manet often had round or slightly pointed ends, and they could be purchased as sets and in a wide variety of colors (fig. 18.13). As described below, the artist manipulated the pastel in a variety of ways to achieve a painterly effect.\n\nThe portrait is executed on a canvas stretched over a keyed stretcher and prepared with an off-white ground. The dimensions are a few millimeters shy of a no. 10 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. The canvas is visually estimated to be a fine, plain weave linen. The work has an average thread count (standard deviation) of 31.0V (0.7) \u00d7 32.1H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. There is a warp-thread match between this work and Manet\u2019s Man with the Dog (cat. 21; [RW II 67]). The close correspondence in the warp threads indicates that the canvases were cut from the same bolt of cloth.\n\nThe canvas displays mild cusping along the stretcher\u2019s left edge. More pronounced cusping is visible along the right edge. Variations in thread thickness are present throughout the canvas, with most of the prominent canvas slubs running in the horizontal direction.\n\nSince only one set of tack holes is present, the canvas is probably in its original stretching, and the aforementioned cusping corresponds exactly to the placement of the tacks. Tidy corner folds are present on the right and left tacking edges. The canvas is trimmed to just beyond the outer edges of the stretcher. The edges are jagged and uneven and appear to have been cut with scissors. All tacks are present except for the second tack from the left on the bottom tacking margin. Most of the tack heads measure less than 5 mm in diameter, smaller than those used on Manet\u2019s Man with the Dog (cat. 21; [RW II 67]). The tacks are visually estimated to be iron and do not have a coating. Remnants of a blue-paper dust cover are present on all four tacking margins and cling to some of the tack heads (fig. 18.14).\n\nThe stretcher (fig. 18.15) has a horizontal crossbar. The tacking edge depth is approximately 13 mm. To prevent contact with the canvas, the stretcher members are beveled inward at the front and back so that the thickest area is at the tacking edge. Ten keys are present: two in each of the four corners, and one on either side of the horizontal crossbar.\n\nThere are no manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks present on either the canvas or the stretcher, and none are mentioned in past reports.\n\nThere is no visual evidence of sizing, however the lack of staining or degradation to the canvas indicates that the canvas was sized before the ground was applied.\n\nThe ground is off-white and is mainly composed of lead white in an oil medium. It extends to the cut edges of the canvas on the top, left, and bottom tacking margins. There are a few skips in the ground along the right edge, possibly indicating that this edge was close to that of the priming frame. X-radiography reveals that the ground was applied in a multidirectional manner with broad, sweeping strokes. These closely correspond to the size and shape of marks made by a spatula or palette knife, the nineteenth-century color merchant\u2019s tool of choice for applying grounds (fig. 18.16). When viewed at an oblique angle, the ground has a slight sheen, one of the characteristics of oil-based media. Although canvases prepared with a gritty ground, specifically for use with pastels, could be purchased from artist\u2019s suppliers, it appears that Manet used a canvas prepared with a ground suitable for oil painting.\n\n547 \u00d7 452 mm.\n\nManet (right lower edge, in gray pastel) (fig. 18.17). The signature reads correctly when the canvas is turned 90 degrees clockwise from its standard orientation.\n\nEM (lower right corner, in red ink) (fig. 18.17).\n\nIt is likely that Manet executed Portrait of Alphonse Maureau in a number of sittings. He began the composition by focusing on the figure and using a dark pastel stick to describe its basic form with fast gestural lines. Manet may have changed the shape of the figure subtly as he drew it, as the dark shape in the lower right quadrant resembles a chair arm or back, a shadow, a sleeve, or shoulders. Further evidence of changes to the composition can be seen above the figure\u2019s proper right shoulder, where white pastel was used to mask a dark area. Whereas the hands were delineated with just a few quick strokes of pinks, ochers, white, and black, the face received a great deal of attention. Manet applied the pointed ends of pastel sticks in a multidirectional manner, layering and re-layering light and dark shades to create the skin tones. The only areas of blending are immediately in front of the ear and in the moustache, and in both instances Manet seems to have wanted to create even tones to work against. Otherwise, the volumes of the cheekbones, chin, nose, eyes, and forehead are composed of individual strokes of pinks, orange ochers, whites, dark browns, and blacks. A few slow individual strokes can be seen along the ear, and they contrast sharply with the rapid strokes used elsewhere.\n\nIn contrast to the individual pastel marks in the face, the black hat and coat were created with soft strokes. In these areas, Manet often seems to have begun the composition with the broad side of a pastel stick, adding several different layers of the same color before blending them together with a small amount of moisture to create the illusion of a dark velvety textile. He then alternated between the broad side of a gray or white pastel stick and a pointed black pastel to give shape to the coat\u2019s collar, body, and sleeves. Manet seems to have varied the pressure he applied to the gray pastel, as the broad lines in the torso blend into one another. The white shirt, of which only the collar is seen, was applied late in the composition and over some dark underlayers, as was the black of the knotted tie. Maureau wears a blue waistcoat, which Manet depicted with two blue pastels: a light greenish-blue and a dark blue, both often applied over the black pastel. These are offset by a primary blue applied to a reserved area of ground in the center of the man\u2019s chest.\n\nThe use of the off-white ground as a midtone is most noticeable in the background. Manet covered the area closest to the figure with broad strokes from the sides of gray and white pastel sticks. He may have wet the pastels prior to use, or applied wet pastel over dry, as the shades blended into one another and, in some areas, form a moderately thick layer. Here and there, the artist used the point of a pastel stick to recreate the tendrils in the floral design of a curtain. To the right of the figure, the pastel application is thinner, and blending is less apparent and individual pastel strokes are easily identifiable.\n\nManet primarily used additive techniques to create Portrait of Alphonse Maureau. There are two areas of scraping by the artist: a highlight along the bridge of Maureau\u2019s nose, and a second highlight on the coat collar. Pastel techniques typically do not include scumbling, but Manet attempted to do this in the shadowy form behind Maureau\u2019s proper left arm and along the proper right shoulder.\n\nThe earliest condition report for this work dates to 1988 and states: \u201cThe surface is very fragile and does not have a good bond to its canvas support.\u201d The other report on file is an outgoing condition report that documents observations made on the work prior to a loan to the Toledo (Ohio) Museum of Art in 2012. This report documents undulations in the canvas and pinhole losses in the media.\n\nThere is neither documentation nor visual evidence of any treatment to the media, but in 2012 steps were taken to mitigate any media loss that could result from movement of the textile support. A stretched canvas is drum-like and prone to movement if subjected to even mild shocks, such as those produced by the use of hammers or power drills during art installation or the bumping of an art transport cart on an uneven floor. Since pastel contains only a minimal amount of binder, it will detach from the surface of the textile at the slightest vibration. At the Art Institute of Chicago, it is common practice to reduce the possibility of pastel loss by modifying historic frames to better accommodate a static-free glazing and outfitting the framing package with inserts of quilt batting and foam to dampen vibrations that may occur during transport. These modifications were carried out for the frame for Portrait of Alphonse Maureau.\n\nAs noted in the 1988 condition report for the artwork, the pastel media remains exceptionally fragile and susceptible to damage. Recent examination of the artwork revealed not only the pinhole losses documented in the 2012 outgoing condition report but also areas that are easily subject to new loss or enlargement of old losses. These are especially prominent along the horizontal weft threads (fig. 18.18), where the pastel appears to have popped off the support. Manet used a canvas prepared with a slick ground; it contains no gritty materials that might offer a place for the pastel particles to cling and is likely better suited to oil painting. That choice is at least partially responsible for this instability. However, contraction of the canvas over time may also be responsible for the losses. The pastel, particularly those areas where it was dampened or thickly applied, forms an inflexible yet powdery layer. These areas would not have been able to shrink with the underlying textile; thus the pastel layers were forced away from the support, resulting in detachment when there was nothing beneath them.\n\nAnother reason for the instability in the pastel layers is deformation of the canvas due to movement of the stretcher bars. In the case of Portrait of Alphonse Maureau, the upper and lower stretcher members have shifted, causing the canvas to develop undulations in all corners and diagonal draws in the lower right corner (fig. 18.19). While it is possible to adjust the tension of the stretcher with the triangular keys, it would be very difficult to do so without damage to the layers of pastel media, hence the need for the padded inserts mentioned above.\n\nOther damage to the artwork includes mild deterioration to the tacking margins, with small tears scattered along the edges of the canvas.\n\nThere are several holes in the front of the canvas, close to the edges (fig. 18.20). These do not constitute damage; rather they appear to relate to wooden spacers, which were probably nailed through the canvas and separated the fragile pastel surface from the frame or glazing. The holes are approximately the same diameter as the brads used on The Man with the Dog (cat. 21).\n\nThe red \u201cEM\u201d stamp was applied to the portrait after Manet\u2019s death, as seen with The Man with the Dog (cat. 21). The media around the stamp was removed with a blade prior to application of the stamp.  \nRachel Freeman\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">By descent from the artist to his wife, Suzanne Manet (n\u00e9e Leenhoff; 1829\u20131906), Paris, Apr. 30, 1883.\n\nSold by Suzanne Manet at H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Feb. 4\u20135, 1884, lot 121, to Marcel Bernstein (1840\u20131896), Paris, for 1,050 francs.\n\nDeposited by Ivan Shchukin (1869\u20131908), Paris, at Durand-Ruel, Paris, June 28, 1900.\n\nSold by Ivan Shchukin to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Dec. 28, 1900, for 4,500 francs.\n\nDurand-Ruel, Paris, to at least 1914.\n\nCarl O.

Piper &amp; Co., 1912), p. 327, no. 121, the buyer was recorded as simply Bernstein. Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, Edouard Manet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Pastels, aquarelles et dessins(Biblioth\u00e8que des arts, 1975), p. 2, no. 6 (ill.), provides the first name \u201cMarcel.\u201d Marcel married Ida Seligman. Their son, Henri Bernstein, was born in 1876, and Manet painted his portrait in 1881. Since there are no dates for Marcel Bernstein\u2019s ownership, it is possible that the work remained in his collection until his death in 1896 (there is no known estate sale for Marcel Bernstein), at which time it passed to either his widow or his son. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, owns a portrait painting by Goya of Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zu\u00f1iga (1787\u201388, 49.7.41) that was previously in the collection of Henri Bernstein. That picture was sold privately through Duveen in 1925. Therefore, it is possible that this Portrait of Alphonse Maureau was likewise sold privately, perhaps to Ivan Shchukin.\n\nFlavie Durand-Ruel, email message to Gloria Groom, May 23, 2016 in curatorial file, Art Institute of Chicago. Durand-Ruel notes, \u201cThis pastel was deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris on June 28th 1900 by Ivan Chtchoukine (Durand-Ruel Paris Deposit no. 9835)\u201d; however, this is probably a phonetic spelling of Shchukin and refers to Ivan Shchukin (1869\u20131908). According to Albert Kostenevich, \u201cRussian Clients of Ambroise Vollard,\u201d in C\u00e9zanne to Picasso: Ambroise Vollard, Patron of the Avant-Garde, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2006), pp. 243\u201344, Ivan Shchukin was a younger brother of the important Russian collector Sergei Shchukin (1854\u20131936). Ivan was most likely the first Russian collector to become associated with modern French art and even acquired works on paper.\n\nFlavie Durand-Ruel, e-mail message to Gloria Groom, May 23, 2016, in curatorial file, Art Institute of Chicago.

Durand-Ruel wrote, \u201cThe pastel was sent to Cassirer, Berlin, in 1914, and disappeared thereafter, probably confiscated by the German government as enemy property.\u201d\n\nFlavie Durand-Ruel, May 23, 2016 to Gloria Groom, in curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlavie Durand-Ruel, e-mail message to Gloria Groom, May 23, 2016, in curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.
