She spent her entire life in Boston and neighboring Cambridge and Brookline. Edinburg attended the near-by Walnut Hill School\u2014whose curriculum emphasized the arts\u2014and then Wellesley College, where she focused on art history and French. Her husband of thirty-four years, Joseph M. Edinburg (1920\u20131983), was an executive with Chandler &amp; Farquhar, a Boston-based hardware and machinists\u2019 supplies dealer, of which her father had served as president. The Edinburgs had three children: Jo-Ann Edinburg Pinkowitz, John Edinburg, and Hope Edinburgh (died 2003).\n\nEdinburg\u2019s parents collected eighteenth-century French furniture, Chinese porcelain and furniture, and livres d\u2019artistes (books illustrated by artists). While at Wellesley, she began to buy Chinese art. From a young age, she collected works on paper reflecting the major artistic movements of the first half of the twentieth century. As the ability to travel improved after World War II and she was able to see more art, Edinburg broadened her interests to include prints and drawings of the fifteenth through the twentieth century and Chinese ceramics of the Tang and Song dynasties.\n\nFor many years, Edinburg was deeply involved with Boston-based art institutions, including the Wellesley College Museum of Art, the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, and the Museum of Fine Arts. Her interest in museums extended beyond those of the Boston area. As she stated, \u201cI have never thought of my collection as an entirely personal or speculative endeavor; rather, I have always believed that it should ultimately enter a major museum so that a wide public can appreciate it.\u201d\n\nUpon the recommendation of Boston-based print seller James Bergquist, in March 1991 Edinburg composed a letter that she allegedly sent to three curators describing her collections and the possibility that she might donate them to a public institution. It is believed that two museums never responded, but Art Institute of Chicago director James N. Wood, Prints and Drawings curator Douglas Druick, and Asian art curator Yutaka Mino flew to Boston to meet the collector. They found that Edinburg had acquired examples of the highest quality. In terms of prints, she brought strength in many areas that the Art Institute hoped to fortify: examples by French peintres-graveurs, German Romantics, nineteenth-century British and American printmakers, and artist\u2019s books.\n\nThe relationship began with a large loan of prints and an occasional gift. Edinburg then started buying prints, drawings, and books with the Art Institute\u2019s collection in mind. In 1998 she began the process of making partial-interest gifts of sixty-seven drawings she had owned for some time. Two displays celebrated this benefaction: Old Masters Drawings: Gifts of a Lifetime from the Dorothy Braude Edinburg Collection in the Art Institute of Chicago, December 11, 1998\u2013March 28, 1999, and Drawn to Form: Modern Drawings from Dorothy Braude Edinburg to the Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection in the Art Institute of Chicago,June 11\u2013September 7, 1999.\n\nFifteen years into this partnership, the Art Institute mounted an exhibition of over 160 drawings (June 3\u2013July 30, 2006). A fully illustrated catalogue, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection was published at that time. That she chose to name her collection for her parents indicates the critical role they played in her development as an art lover and significant collector.\n\nAlthough drawings were her primary interest, Edinburg also collected Asian art, including fine examples of Chinese ceramics and Korean celadons. The Art Institute celebrated her gift of these items to the Department of Asian Art in another exhibition, Deft Hands, Discerning Eyes: Chinese and Korean Ceramics from the Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection, September 18, 2008\u2013January 10, 2010.\n\nBy May 2010, much of Edinburg\u2019s collection was housed at the Art Institute, with facsimiles adorning her home in Brookline. In June 2013, she presented the 949 works that remained with her. Altogether, from 1991 to 2014, she gave 1,336 works to the Department of Prints and Drawings (658 prints, 270 drawings, and 408 books), and 183 to the Department of Asian Art. Moreover, an additional seventeen drawings and prints have been donated by others in her honor. To celebrate this largesse, the Art Institute mounted a fifth exhibition, focusing on the drawings Edinburg bought specifically for the museum: The Thrill of the Chase: Drawings for the Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection, March 15\u2013June 15, 2014. The exhibition included her final purchase. Dorothy Edinburg died in Brookline on January 5, 2015.\n\nMan with an Ax (cat. 62)\n\nBoy in the Country (cat. 11)\n\nStacks of Wheat (cat. 33)\n\nAt the Window, rue des Trois-Fr\u00e8res (cat. 7)\n\nVase of Flowers (cat. 1)\n\nStudy for \u201cBathers in a Forest\u201d (cat. 23)\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Mrs. Dorothy Braude Edinburg\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Art Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K.

In 1996 she lent five drawings and seventeen prints, and in 1997 another thirty-three drawings. Finally, in 1998 she sent out sixty-seven drawings as a partial interest gift, intended to be completely given over the ensuing decade.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master through Modern; The Harry B. and Bessie K.
