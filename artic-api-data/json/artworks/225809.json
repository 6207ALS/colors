    "description": "<p>Anni Albers was one of the leading textile designers and weavers of the 20th century. She trained at the Bauhaus school of design in Germany, where she met her husband, Josef Albers. The Bauhaus closed permanently in 1933 under pressure from the Nazis, and the couple relocated to the United States. Throughout these years, Anni Albers continued to design and weave, and in the 1960s she developed a new interest in printmaking. <em>Eclat</em>, a seemingly random arrangement of small parallelograms arranged on the diagonal, was first conceived as a print and was subsequently produced by Knoll as a furnishing fabric.</p>\n",
