The same historical and fictional subjects from China and Japan also appear in Tsukioka Yoshitoshi\u2019s famous series of prints <em>One Hundred Aspects of the Moon</em> (1885\u201391).</p>\n<p><em>Hazy Night Moon</em> features the 12th-century historical figure Kumasaka no Ch\u014dhan, a priest who was also the leader of a band of robbers. He was killed while attacking a group of warriors. He is shown here as an actor wearing a N\u014d mask and elaborate robes because after his death, he became the subject of a N\u014d drama in which his ghost asks a traveler to pray for him so that he may escape his torment in the afterlife.</p>\n",
