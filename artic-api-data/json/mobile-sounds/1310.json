    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this Parisian sideboard of about 1900, a traditional form has been radically transformed, its outline is energized by fluid decorative lines, its flat surfaces echo these with sinuous linear carvings inspired by foliage, flowers and perhaps the floating ribbon like forms of sea plants.  Notice too, the curving root-like shelf brackets.  The cabinet is made in the Art Nouveau or New Art style which flowered at the end of the 19th Century especially in Paris.  As the movement's name suggests, its artists' and designers' aim to create a truly modern kind of art.  They turned away from tradition and instead took the voluptuous asymmetrical curving form seen in nature as the starting point for their inspiration. Louis-Desire-Eugene Gaillard, the cabinet's designer was deeply involved in the Art Nouveau movement, he collaborated on the famous Maison de L'Art Nouveau, a Paris gallery of modern art whose windows were designed by the painter Toulouse-Lautrec and made by Louis Comfort Tiffany.  Gaillard also designed rooms for a modern show house displayed in the Universal Exhibition in Paris held in 1900, among them, a dining room.  This sideboard was originally a part of a second dining room that Gaillard created around that time.</p>\n",
