    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Scarf developed from Paul Cezanne\u2019s <em>The Vase of Tulips</em>, About 1890, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">As is typical of Cezanne\u2019s work, the painting is carefully considered and hard-won, especially in the tense spatial relationships between objects. The traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left bear witness to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s changing opinion as he struggled to make the composition work.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;33 x 46 in.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong>&nbsp;100% polyester.</li><li><strong>Hand wash, hang dry.</strong></li></ul>",
