Daniel M\u00fcller, a German immigrant who grew up in the carousel industry, designed and carved the figure. M\u00fcller was known for his realistic style, visible here in the musculature of the horse\u2019s legs mid-jump and the delicate flare of its nostrils.</p>\n<p>Conservation analysis revealed that the horse was painted twice, the later visible layer possibly by artist and former Dentzel Company employee Angelo Calsamilia, who traveled the country to repaint carousel figures in active use.</p>\n",
