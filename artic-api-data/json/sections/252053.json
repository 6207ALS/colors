For these early lithographs, Franklin assumed poses that appear repeatedly in Whistler\u2019s paintings, drawings, and etchings of the early and mid-1870s. She wears a similar costume in two drypoints, Tatting (K 112) and The Muffin (K 13); the most striking parallel is to the full-length etched portrait Maud, Standing (fig. 3a [K 114]), begun not long before the artist drew this lithograph.\n\nRecapitulating familiar themes and poses, Whistler freed himself to explore the range of tonalities and textures that could be developed on a lithographic stone. According to T. R. Way (1912), this standing portrait of Franklin in an elaborate hat was the artist\u2019s first experiment of this sort. After drawing the initial outline of the figure, Whistler used pointed and blunt crayons in a variety of hardnesses to develop the hatched shadows and the folds of the model\u2019s gathered skirt. For the deepest shadows, he seems to have employed the softest crayon, which Way referred to as crayon estompe. The result was too heavy, so Whistler used scraping to lighten the blacks and to model the deepest shadows on the shoulder and upper back. Roulette work was used to produce a similar effect in the skirt. Apparently Whistler still found the image too dark, for he had Way pull a number of proofs in brown ink, probably to minimize the heaviness of the shadows.\n\nSlight variations of tone can be noted from one impression to another in the face, hair, hat (see fig. 3b), and skirt, but these are the natural results of the image\u2019s gradual strengthening during the earliest stages of printing (commonly referred to as \u201cbringing the drawing up to color\u201d), rather than of deliberate alterations to the stone.\n\nImpressions were printed in black and brown inks before the removal of three small lines above the model\u2019s head and subtractive work in her face and skirt.\n\nChicago: MWC, black ink on ivory plate paper (370 \u00d7 237 mm). London: BM, black ink on ivory chine (302 \u00d7 170 mm) mounted on white plate paper (406 \u00d7 254 mm).

The verso of the National Gallery of Art\u2019s impression bears an advertisement for men\u2019s clothing, \u201cThe Record of Fashion,\u201d printed in lithography by the Way firm.\n\nScraping has been used to remove some of the tone in the figure\u2019s face, leaving only a trace in her cheek. Three small parallel lines directly above her head to the right have also been removed by scraping. Several of the folds along the bottom of her gathered skirt have been lightened.\n\nChicago: AIC, black ink on ivory chine (304 \u00d7 171 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (401 \u00d7 281 mm), signed.  \nNesta R.
