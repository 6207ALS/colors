    "description": "<p>Born in Turkish Armenia, Arshile Gorky immigrated to the United States in the 1920s and became an influential member of the New York art scene. Profoundly interested in avant-garde European art, he experimented with a variety of styles. Young artists working in New York were particularly stimulated by the European Surrealists, many of whom moved to the city before and during World War II and whose circle Gorky joined. The 1940s, especially the years 1944\u201347, marked the creation of his most important work, produced in a kind of stream of consciousness or \u201cautomatic\u201d manner of painting. <em>The Plough and the Song</em> reflects the artist\u2019s indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Mir\u00f3, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are hallmarks of Gorky\u2019s mature work. A delicate contour line delineates the biomorphic forms in the center of the composition, in marked contrast to the loose brushwork that defines the background. The title signals Gorky\u2019s nostalgia for his heritage, as the artist wrote in 1944: \u201cYou cannot imagine the fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows. . . . And the songs, our ancient songs of the Armenian people, our suffering people. . . . So many shapes, so many shapes and ideas, happily a secret treasure to which I have been entrusted the key.\u201d Deeply earthbound and poetic, <em>The Plough and the Song</em> is at once a still life, a landscape, and a fantasy.</p>\n",
