    "description": "<p><em>The End of the Day, Adirondacks</em> captures a fisherman\u2019s introspective moment. Homer rendered the light from the setting sun with pale pink and orange washes, seen in the sky and reflected in the water. Foliage in the background and at the right side of the image is depicted abstractly, adding to the scene\u2019s hazy atmosphere. This area shows signs of overwork, where Homer repeatedly removed and added color as he sought to soften the contours of the landscape, as if enveloped in the mist of evening. Characteristic of the artist\u2019s working methods, he did not try to obscure the passage and chose to let it stand.</p>\n",
