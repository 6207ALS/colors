    "description": "<p>This elaborate work demonstrates the full embrace of drawing as an art form in its own right. Lambert Doomer visited the site represented here earlier in his career, and on that occassion he created a less refined, though similarly accurate rendering of its topography. Over a decade later, he returned to the subject and endowed it with a sense of enchantment. The artist alternated thin passages of ink wash with bald areas of the paper support (the reserve) to create an effect of dappled light. In the dense grove of trees at upper right, Doomer articulated the light passing between the tree trunks like so many openings in a mesh screen.</p>\n",
