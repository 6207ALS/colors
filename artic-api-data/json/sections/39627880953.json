Gauguin carved all of the blocks from indigenous wood, and although the majority of them were irregularly shaped to some degree, three were a more standard rectilinear format. These include Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98), and this print. Based on attributes such as ink viscosity, the manner in which the ink sits on the paper, the printed wood grain, and surface textures inherent to the wood used in the various groupings, this trio share close affinities to each other. Although much damaged, the wood block used for this print is extant, in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague (fig. 97.1.2).\n\nGauguin lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, yet the pronounced textures of wood grain and knots that printed along with his carved imagery are integral to the overall aesthetic appearance of the group. These irregularities set the prints apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images of the Noa Noa Suite. The Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints is made up of wood-block prints in the true sense of the word: cut crudely into wood that was sawn, planed, and sanded to create work surfaces. These were far too prone to splintering to be incised with the tip of a needle, so the artist relied solely on the knife, drawing on his skill as a sculptor of wood in the round. Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin selected a thin, translucent paper and most likely used a second, thicker paper to support the diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the bottom sheet without tearing it. When he then lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter one. Using this technique Gauguin could also prevent the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block or tearing when he lifted it from the block.\n\nThe wood block was printed in black ink that was unevenly applied in a single layer and sat on the high points throughout. As a result, the imperfections in the wood block and segments of wood grain appear in this impression.\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with mitsumata (est.) fibers and minimal sizing to print the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. The diaphanous sheets are translucent, extraordinarily fragile, and easily damaged. In this impression, the tissue-thin sheet was sympathetically laid down on a similarly thin sheet of modern white wove Japanese paper.\n\n163 \u00d7 305 mm (image); 228 \u00d7 305 mm (primary support); 237 \u00d7 318 mm (secondary support)\n\nBefore Gauguin produced the second state of this composition, he carved a single first-state impression into the block (fig. 97.1.3) that was 225 mm shorter in width. Initially the composition extended only as far as the artist\u2019s monogram and was enclosed by a thick border of uncut wood block on all four sides. Gouge marks in the upper left stop abruptly in a series of horizontal strokes adjacent to the border, and the artist\u2019s monogram is contained within a semicircular cartouche (fig. 97.1.4). In the second state, of which this is the second impression pulled, the artist removed the border on the left and significantly extended the width of the composition; he added the standing figure on the far left and two small animals huddled together, and extended a branch with foliage from the upper left corner to meet the seated animal above the central pair of figures that he had carved in the first state (fig. 97.1.5). This central pair of figures is significant as the artist used it elsewhere, perhaps as the matrix, for a later transfer drawing (see cat. 125).\n\nAmong the group of fifteen prints, this is the only one in which the composition was so radically expanded in a second state. Given that Gauguin had difficulty procuring wood suited to his needs, it is interesting that here he did not initially use the entire length of the block that was available to him. The same block was used for both states.\n\nAdditionally, it is likely that the wood block used for this print was fashioned from the same thick plank of wood used to fashion the block for Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), given their nearly identical overall dimensions and surface characteristics. Among these, the crispness and clarity of the incising used to similar aesthetic ends in both blocks point to the use of wood that appears to have been harder and had a more compressed grain, which was able to withstand incising without splintering under the pressure of the needle or compressing under the pressure exerted by the artist\u2019s hand during printing. As he did to make four other pairs of blocks for this suite, Gauguin carved the two matrices from the same plank, not by using the front and back as he had done with blocks in the past, but by sawing thick planks of wood in half laterally to create two thinner sections.\n\nBefore entering the Art Institute collection, the thin Japanese paper was laid down on a thin sheet of white wove Japanese paper that is sympathetic in weight and tone to the original. Mounting was most likely carried out to provide structural support to a paper that already had a 3 cm tear and loss in the lower left and a 5 cm loss along the top above the image at center. There is fine creasing and slight adhesive residue.\n\nFollowing acquisition, undulations were visible throughout and numerous paper hinge residues appeared along the top. These were removed in a second conservation intervention in which the sheet was also successfully humidified and flattened.\n\nThe print remains in excellent condition.  \nHarriet K.

Till Gottheiner (P. Hamlyn, 1963), pp. 7, 8, 16, and cat. 4. This block and its extant companion, Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired), are greatly worn, perhaps, as has been suggested by S\u00fdkorov\u00e1, irregularly planed down by the artist, but more liked eroded by the elements when the soft wood \u201cplanks with carvings [were] tucked away in the fence surrounding the homestead\u201d of one of Gauguin\u2019s former Tahitian mistress (vahine) (p. 8). The author\u2019s observations were extremely helpful to this study and he is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nThe dimensions of the block listed in the book are 16.1 \u00d7 33.4 \u00d7 2 cm, and these dimensions are closely aligned to the dimensions of impressions of Te arii vahine\u2014opoi before the block was cut down to produce another woodcut on the verso.\n\nGauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 1899, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 Daniel de Monfreid, ed. Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . . Faites sur des planches quelconques et avec des yeux de plus en plus mauvais, ces gravures sortent forc\u00e9ment du sale m\u00e9tier ordinaire et sont tr\u00e8s imparfaites, mais elles sont je crois int\u00e9ressantes comme Art\u201d (I am sending you a small series of wood engravings. . . . Made on some wood planks, and with my failing eyesight, these engravings are necessarily produced by a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form). Gauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 1899, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 Daniel de Monfreid, ed. Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59. Translation by Genevieve Westerby.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2), and mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nGauguin wrote to Vollard in January 1900: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d Gauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, reprinted in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190.

(National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice.
