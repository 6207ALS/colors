It featured his recent Nice paintings, which represented a shift from the experimental, abstract canvases of 1913\u201317, such as Bathers by a River (1909/10, May\u2013Nov. 1913, and early spring 1916\u2013c. Oct. 1917 [cat. 25]), to a more atmospheric, naturalistic style. In a 1919 interview with the Swedish art historian Ragnar Hoppe, Matisse explained, \u201cI am seeking a new synthesis . . . I first worked as an impressionist, directly from nature; I later sought concentration and more intense expression both in line and color, and then, of course, I had to sacrifice other values to a certain degree, corporeality and spatial depth, the richness of detail. Now I want to combine it all.\u201d After arriving in Nice in December 1917, Matisse renewed his investigations of direct and diffused light in paint and in color with naturalistic depictions of his hotel rooms, such as Interior at Nice (Room at the Beau Rivage) (1917\u201318; Philadelphia Museum of Art) and Interior at Nice (Room at the H\u00f4tel M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e) (c. 1919; fig. 30.1). The Art Institute\u2019s canvas is one of the largest works that Matisse painted while staying at the H\u00f4tel de la M\u00e9diterrann\u00e9e, in a room with elaborate rococo decor, a pink tiled floor, and a balcony facing the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nAs Matisse began to reintroduce a more organic style into his work, he revived his interest in nineteenth-century painting. Toward the end of 1917, he began a significant friendship with the aging Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir (see fig. 30.2), who lived near Nice in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Matisse drew inspiration from their conversations and the ailing older artist\u2019s rigorous commitment to continue painting despite his failing health. In 1918 Matisse presented to Renoir his recent canvases and works from his personal collection by Gustave Courbet, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Renoir. In a catalogue essay for a 1918 exhibition on French painting he wrote, \u201cthe work of Renoir, after that of C\u00e9zanne . . . saves us from whatever drying effect there is in pure abstraction.\u201d In Interior at Nice, Matisse balanced sharp, constructive elements of the composition, such as the side table made of outlined blocks of red and orange, with his softened treatment of areas including the bright sky. The artist produced a pronounced optical effect of gradient light by depicting the textured, blue sky with light-gray scumbles that gradually fade to white in a misty band above the repositioned horizon. The overlapping strokes recall the colorist, expressive brushwork in two small Renoir canvases that he owned: Nude with Raised Arm (c. 1900; fig. 30.3) and Nude with Bath Towel (c. 1900; fig. 30.4, see fig. 30.5). However, in leaving traces of the pentimento of an earlier horizon line visible in the water with soft, gray highlights, Matisse offset the blurred visual effect of the Mediterranean sky with traces of his abstracted painterly experiments. The flattened red-and-white bolt on the left of the composition creates a similar tension by calling attention to the surface of the canvas while deepening the perspective of the interior.\n\nIn Interior at Nice, Matisse tested different means of capturing the dematerializing force of light in paint. For the similarly sized The Venetian Blinds (spring 1919; fig. 30.6), he used bold, contrasting colors to capture the intense sunlight and shadows and glimpses of the bright coastal landscape between the slats of the shuttered windows. However, the softer tones of Interior at Nice recall Matisse\u2019s description in a 1918 letter to the painter Charles Camoin: \u201cNice is a beautiful place! What a gentle and soft light in spite of its brightness . . . It is silvered. Even the objects that it touches are very colored.\u201d In this canvas, the artist layered and removed paint to portray the impact of direct and diffused sunlight. On the right side of the window, the artist made the shaded curtain of thick, gray, blended strokes that outline the shadows of the doorway and rounded transom, giving a luminous quality to the highlighted sheer curtain accented by heavy, white strokes of paint along its left edge. On the other side, Matisse translated the clarity of brilliant direct light by leaving the curtain area transparent to reveal the fabric and grid of sketchlines. He then introduced scumbled, abstract, blue-green blocks that dissolve the upper portion of the shutters into swatches of color. The artist translated the transformative effect of light on vision and material into paint.\n\nWhile Interior at Nice demonstrates the synthesis of Matisse\u2019s naturalistic and abstract modes of painting, his treatment of the d\u00e9cor reveals his interest in revising and reworking compositions to achieve a pictorial balance. The artist carefully placed his model, Antoinette Arnoux, just outside the threshold that separates the interior and exterior spaces but visually aligned her with the decorative objects in the room. Traces of his adjustments of the chair, mirror, tables, and painting along the wall show how he gradually unified the pictorial elements in the composition. The presence of the artist\u2019s own painting Seated Woman Next to an Open Window (1919; fig. 30.7), which has a similar composition in outlined blocks of color, points to his enduring investigations in Nice and his extended studies of the effects of light.  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse painted Interior at Nice on a no. 60 landscape (paysage) pre-primed standard-size (130 \u00d7 97 cm) linen canvas, one of his largest works from the early 1920s. The artist began with a black painted sketch and added a few very dilute black washes. He then laid in repeated thin layers of yellow ocher, blue-green, and orange-pink (the primary colors transposed into more golden tones). Over these colors he added pale gray and white scumbles, adjusting the tones to suggest the play of light as it shifts from one side of the room to the other. These uneven, superimposed layers lend a lively, variable shimmer to the scene. He portrayed diffuse light shining through the left sheer curtain and direct light through the right.\n\nThe artist moved and adjusted almost every element in the composition, especially during the sketch stage, altering architectural elements and rearranging the furniture. The initial black sketch lines and washes were only lightly covered, so they remain visible through the overlying paint. Far from trying to hide them completely, Matisse emphasized these underlying darker areas by filling in some of the pentimenti with gray scumbles, When he changed the horizon line and figure\u2019s head, however, he instead scraped down the dry paint before repositioning them slightly lower.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 30.8).\n\nSigned: Henri.Matisse (lower right, in dilute brown paint). The signature was applied over dried paint layers (fig. 30.9 and fig. 30.10).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original foldover edges indicate that the dimensions were originally 130.5 \u00d7 89.0 cm, which corresponds to a no. 60 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas (130 \u00d7 89 cm). This is one of Matisse\u2019s largest works from the early 1920s.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 17.3V (0.8) \u00d7 18.5H (0.4) threads/cm. Standard deviation calculations, the thread packing patterns, and the selvage all indicate that the horizontal threads correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe horizontal thread-angle map indicates strong cusping along the bottom edge, probably from the stretching of a larger piece of canvas for commercial ground application (fig. 30.11). The bottom tacking edge is not primed and appears to be the selvage edge. The raw canvas extends 2\u20133 cm beyond the priming to an approximately 3.2 cm wide tacking margin. The three other sides are cut through the ground, which extends to the edges.\n\nCurrent stretching: After the canvas was lined in 1967, it was put on a new, larger, in-square stretcher, and 1.0\u20131.5 cm of the original unpainted tacking margins were shifted onto the front surface (including some tack holes). The picture has been framed and retouched so these holes do not show (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: The edge of the priming was aligned with the bottom front edge of the stretcher. The original foldover lines reveal that the stretcher was slightly off-square, distended at the bottom right corner. In place on Matisse\u2019s easel, the top edge of the off-square image would have tipped down to the left slightly.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Redwood ICA spring stretcher, larger than the original.\n\nOriginal stretcher: A black-and-white photograph of the back of the painting, probably dating to the 1967 lining, shows what appears to be the original stretcher (fig. 30.12). This stretcher was six-membered, including vertical and horizontal crossbars, with keyable mortise and tenon joints. There were knots in the wood.\n\nNone apparent in the prelining photograph of the verso.\n\nCross-sectional analysis shows a tan-colored organic layer between the ground and canvas that exhibits a blue fluorescence under ultraviolet light, and is probably glue sizing (fig. 30.13).\n\nPre-primed (fig. 30.14). Since the canvas was tightly stretched in a format larger than the picture when primed (strong primary cusping on bottom edge only), it was probably commercially primed, though the tacks were closer together (5\u20138 cm) than is usual for commercial priming. It is also possible that Matisse himself pre-primed the canvas in a larger format, or had it done by a workman.\n\nCross-sectional analysis revealed two layers of ground, both relatively thin, with the bottom layer approximately 10\u201340 \u03bcm and the top layer approximately 33\u201360 \u03bcm (fig. 30.15).\n\nThe bottom layer is cream-colored, and the top layer is white mixed with some blue-colored particles.\n\nFTIR analysis indicates that the white ground contains lead white (basic and neutral lead carbonate) in an oil binder. For the upper white layer, SEM/EDX analysis identified mostly lead white with small amounts of calcium carbonate, ultramarine blue, traces of barium sulfate, strontium sulfate, silicates, silica, and aluminum oxide. For the bottom layer, SEM/EDX analysis identified a calcium carbonate white with minor to trace amounts of silicates, silica, and possibly calcium sulfate.\n\nThe sketch was executed by brush, with dilute black paint. Some of these lines remain uncovered at the top of the fanlight window (fig. 30.14). Matisse added very thin black washes as part of the painted sketch. These areas of diluted black are visible in normal light under the dressing table, chair, and the picture on the wall (fig. 30.16).\n\nOil paint (estimated); the paint appears to have been diluted by the artist.\n\nTransmitted-light images and infrared reflectography reveal many changes made during the preliminary sketch stage (fig. 30.17). The placement of the furniture was of particular concern. Initially a large rectangular form was positioned diagonally from the terrace doorway down toward the bottom right corner (fig. 30.18). The upholstered chair was initially smaller and much farther to the left, aligning with the left edge of the dressing table. Matisse enlarged the outlines of the chair, and then moved it to the right. Its final position is directly below and close in size to the fanlight window at the top, whose semicircular form and scalloped edge it mirrors. The position of the dressing table was shifted several times: it was a little farther back and to the left at one point; at another point it was lower and less diagonally oriented; and in another permutation it had a narrower top as if viewed less from above. The black lines and darkened areas that indicate the prior positions for the upholstered chair and dressing table are still visible through the paint (see fig. 30.19).\n\nInfrared reflectography documents adjustments to virtually every element of the composition during the sketching and the earliest painting stages. The table skirt had many more folds, with fold lines similar in width to the floor\u2019s grid (fig. 30.20). The vase of anemones was at one time slightly lower than in the final composition, and at one point it, as well as the table, was farther to the left. Early sketch lines that were not followed are still apparent in the top portion of the curtain, such as the vertical line marking a narrower shutter (to left of present shutter edge). One can also see the outlines for a second open door with its diagonal top edge. This glass door, sandwiched between the curtain and the shutter, was never painted. In the initial sketch, the bottom doorway threshold and the adjacent wall were angled less obliquely. At some point both the threshold and the top of the doorway were higher. Although both the bottom of the doorway and the balustrade outside are angled, the top of the doorway is not, and neither is the painting on the wall. Matisse repositioned the edges of the white curtains and their ties (the one on the left was originally less angled, like the doorway threshold). The horizon line, dividing sky and water, was at one point lower; at another point it was higher and angled slightly down toward the left, like the balustrade and door threshold. At the left edge of the painting, a sketch line indicates that Matisse considered including a thin slice of the room\u2019s corner, to the right of the orange curtain. He also sketched other angles for the bottom of the white area, possibly molding, at this edge. The painting on the wall was raised higher and resized taller and possibly narrower. The X-ray shows that it was still in its lower position when the first paint layer was applied. The chair at the very right edge had a rounded back that was never painted, though these sketch lines are still visible. The left side of the balcony was wider (due to the originally narrower shutter); the balustrade post outside also changed (fig. 30.21).\n\nThe painting was built up with uneven layers of color (fig. 30.22). On the wall, the layering of color includes superimposed thin washes of yellow ocher, pink, and gray. The pink and ocher are stronger on the right wall, while gray is stronger on the left wall (fig. 30.23). Matisse used gray strokes to modify the color and add a penumbra of diffuse shadow to the interior space, incorporating the gray pentimenti from the initial sketch (see fig. 30.19). The thinness of the paint layers allows the underlying white ground to lend its luminosity to the hues, and abandoned sketch lines are often visible through the paint (fig. 30.24). The uneven application of each layer melds into a colored surface that constantly varies and is atmospheric rather than flat. The visibility of forms in their previous sketched-in positions also lends the composition an active sense of movement. Even the golden damask of the wallpaper is built up in separate layers, with light ocher and darker brown strokes adjusting each other. In some areas the pattern is laid in first with light strokes, then adjusted with darker ones, and in other areas the order is reversed. Because this pattern of yellow and brown on the yellow-pink wall is subtle and partially obscured, it seems to recede back from the picture plane, thereby creating a sense of open space, while the difference in technique lends a sense of wavering light, as if reflected by the sea.\n\nThe little painting on the wall depicts the same spot in the room above which it hangs and re-creates an actual work by Matisse, Woman Seated Next to an Open Window (fig. 30.7).\n\nThe top layer of the pink floor was still wet when the grid pattern was added, and this wet-in-wet technique reduced the harshness of the black lines (fig. 30.25). After painting first the verticals, then the horizontals, Matisse went back with a dry brush and undulated many of the still-wet lines; this rippling is strongest above the upholstered chair, as though influenced by the chair\u2019s own scalloped edge. The wavering movement of the lines and varying intensity of the pink color tend to de-focus the eye and expand the viewer\u2019s gaze (see fig. 30.19). The grid pattern is not consistent from one side of the table and chair to the other. Instead, the lines are responsive to the separate spaces they inhabit, and distort as they come within the fields of other forms, such as the table and chair. Decorative patterning continues over the chair and up the shutter and walls, with the upholstery fabric, shutter slats, and the wallpaper design (fig. 30.26). The perspective in Interior at Nice is not consistent. It is subjectively derived and seems distorted because the viewpoint looks both down onto the chair, table, and floor, as if from high above, as well as outward toward the balcony.\n\nDifferent areas of the sheer white curtain were treated in very different ways, all consistent with the perception of diffuse and direct light through a transparent fabric. In the diffuse interior light the curtain is primarily painted gray, and where seen against the brightness of the sky, it appears transparent. The white highlighted area on the other side, where hit directly by sunlight, appears all the more brilliant in contrast to the gray. Where the sheer fabric dissolves into transparency, Matisse\u2019s handling of form dissolves into abstraction (see fig. 30.19). He disrupted lines of the curtain, fanlight window, and doorway by scraping, wiping, and painting out sections (fig. 30.27 and fig. 30.28). He added areas of color between the geometric scaffolding of black lines, sometimes softening the structure with thin pale scumbles or reinforcing the lines with a heavier black. The French door on the left side was eliminated during the painting stage, but Matisse left some of its black sketch lines exposed in the curtain area, as part of this abstract scaffolding.\n\nMost of the compositional changes were made during the sketch stage, but a few additional changes were made as the painting progressed. These include additional orange flowers in front of the mirror that were later painted out and the dressing table, which at some point had a smaller, more oblong mirror that reflected an orange tile floor, later scumbled over with white (fig. 30.29). The X-ray shows that the overstuffed chair was worked up in paint and then scraped before it was moved toward the center (fig. 30.30 and fig. 30.31). Infrared reflectography shows it was moved before the floor grid was added. And the floor grid was painted before the door threshold was moved down more obliquely, since it runs under the later threshold.\n\nOut on the balcony, the figure\u2019s head was in a higher position, as was the chair, but later, after the paint had dried, the head and wider upper body, as well as the legs, were partially scraped away and repainted (fig. 30.32). The horizon line, dividing the blue water and the light-gray-scumbled blue sky, was higher and angled slightly down toward left, following the slant of the balustrade and original threshold. After scraping the dry paint of this horizon away, Matisse repositioned it with a black line lower down. Changing it again, he chose a point halfway between, and raised the water to that level, covering the black line below, though it is visible as a pentimento in normal light. The scraped area above the new horizon line was covered with a white scumble\u2014appearing almost like a bank of clouds.\n\nThe strong opaque colors of the blue-green shutter and orange curtain stand out from the rest. The curtain functions as a traditional repoussoir that has been pulled back to reveal the scene. The blue-green shutter serves the same function further back\u2014its solidity effectively shuts off the outside view, but where opened, reveals the figure against the limitless sea and sky.\n\nMatisse\u2019s brushwork is varied in graphic quality: the wavering lines of the floor grid, the choppy impasto of the ocean surf, the scrubby whites of the tablecloth, the multidirectional, brushy washes of the wallpaper, the long strokes for vertical areas, and the smudgy translucent strokes of the glass windowpane (fig. 30.33 and fig. 30.34). There are repeated short strokes made by pouncing the brush along the pale-blue mullion that differentiate the mullion and bottom wood panel from the glass, and in the curtain, they better block out the black lines underneath while still remaining translucent (fig. 30.35). A chisel-like tool was used for scraping and a cloth probably for wiping.\n\nMatisse used primarily pastel tones of a carefully balanced triad of orange-pink, blue-green, and ocher. Matisse simply transposed the three primary colors\u2014red, blue, and yellow\u2014by modifying them with an ocher-colored gold. The only more saturated colors that are not pastels, highly modified by white, are the green top portion of the shutter (not overpainted with pale blue and slats like the lower portion), the orange curtain at left, and the orange anemome. Small touches like the model\u2019s purple stockings and the purple anemones do not follow this color scheme (fig. 30.36 and fig. 30.37).\n\nPLM analysis identified lead white, possibly two types of red lake (a pale pink and a deeper pink lake), iron oxide red, and a trace of black in a sample from the pink floor.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe surface is presently unvarnished. There is no evidence that the surface was originally varnished by the artist.\n\nThe painting entered the museum collection in 1956, unlined, probably on its original stretcher, and with a natural-resin varnish on the surface.\n\nIn 1967, the discolored varnish was removed, the canvas was lined with wax-resin adhesive, and it was stretched onto a new larger redwood ICA spring stretcher. Unlike the original stretcher, the new one was in-square. When it was restretched, 1.0\u20131.5 cm of the original unpainted tacking margins became part of the front surface (including some tack holes). The picture has been framed and retouched so these holes do not show The painting\u2019s surface was coated with polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA varnish, and the losses were retouched. The surface was then coated with methacrylate L-67 and a final coating of AYAA.\n\nIn 2008, the previous synthetic varnishes and inpainting were removed, losses were inpainted, and the surface left unvarnished.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition. The lining did not significantly alter the surface. The reflective quality of the lead white ground was not significantly lowered by saturation of the canvas with the wax. The removal of the inappropriate varnish has resulted in a more airy, light-enhanced atmosphere, along with a more direct experience of the artist\u2019s varied facture. There are no significant losses.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a twenty-first-century, American, gilt, molding frame with an ovolo face. The pine molding has oil gilding with a pigmented glue size applied on flat black oil paint over dark-brown-stained pine. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is straight outer side and ovolo (fig. 30.38).\n\nPrevious frame (removed in 2009): The work was previously housed in a eighteenth-century, Louis XIV, convex frame with shell-corner-and-center cartouches connected by foliate scrolls with fleur-de-lis centers on a quadrillage bed. The frame has water gilding over a red-brown bole over gesso. The surface had lost most of the gilding and decape finish. The carved oak moldings were mitered and glued; to adapt the frame to this picture the horizontal moldings were cut and butt jointed close to the center cartouches.

Barr also states that this is one of the last works that Matisse painted while staying at the H\u00f4tel de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.\n\nBetween 1916 and 1917, Henri Matisse purchased five paintings by the nineteenth-century Realist painter Gustave Courbet from his dealer, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, and used the connection to his gallerist to meet Claude Monet in Giverny in May 1917. Matisse brought works from his collection including, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Bathers, a couple of Renoir canvases, and Courbet\u2019s Sleeping Blonde (1849) to a 1918 visit with Renoir. See Spurling, Matisse the Master, pp. 199, 218. By 1910 Matisse owned a small nude by Renoir that he discussed in an interview with J. Sacs in his salon. Sacs recalled, \u201cAs he cast a loving smile upon a Renoir\u2014this nude is a gem: I wouldn\u2019t sell it for a fortune.\u201d Matisse, interview with Sacs, as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 58.\n\nRenoir died in December 1919, but Matisse was allowed to visit his studio between that winter and spring of 1920. On the importance of Matisse\u2019s encounters with Impressionists at this time, see Rebecca Rabinow, \u201cThe Beach at \u00c9tretat,\u201d in Matisse: In Search of True Painting, ed. Dorthe Aagesen and Rabinow (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2012), pp. 117\u201323. On Matisse\u2019s friendship with Renoir, see Spurling, Matisse the Master, pp. 216\u201322; and Augustin de Butler, \u201cMatisse; aux Collettes,\u201d in Renoir et les familiers des Collettes, exh. cat. (Muse\u0301e Renoir, 200). Jack Flam has argued, \u201cIf C\u00e9zanne had been his guiding light in the years between 1899 and 1917, beginning in 1918, the art of Renoir seemed more directly connected to the concerns of his own painting.\u201d Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 78. See also Dominique Fourcade, \u201cAutres propos de Henri Matisse,\u201d Macula 1 (1976), pp. 92\u2013115.\n\nUpon seeing Matisse\u2019s The Open Window (1917), Renoir asked, \u201cBut how did you do that? If I put a black like that in a picture, it would jump forward. It wouldn\u2019t stay in place.\u201d Recounted by Pierre Courthion and quoted in Jack Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, 1869\u20131918 (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 469.

Upon his arrival a year earlier he had expressed similar thoughts to his wife Am\u00e9lie: \u201cMost people came here for the light and the picturesque quality. As for me, I come from the north. What made me stay are the great colored reflections . . . the luminosity of daylight.\u201d H. Matisse to A. Matisse, Dec. 31, 1917, as translated in Cowart, \u201cPlace of Silvered Light,\u201d p. 19.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler \u201c1956\\_339\\_Matisse\\_Interior\\_Nice\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 25, 2017; report on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see H.

They have been partially painted out with white.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Matisse\u2019s technique.\n\nWhen Matisse wanted to remove something on his canvas, he often scraped when the paint had dried. Because the figure is relatively small and each stroke carries descriptive weight, Matisse might have sought a smoother surface on which to work or a fresh start.\n\nThe same colors are seen in the painting that hangs on the back wall. Analysis indicates the possible presence of iron oxide, in addition to red lake in the pink of the floor. The iron oxide would give the pink a warmer, more orange hue.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1956\\_339\\_Matisse\\_Interior\\_Nice\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 25, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed.
