This is a preliminary study for the artist\u2019s first important commission, <em>The Oath on the R\u00fctli</em>, in Zurich\u2019s city hall. Both the study and the final painting depict the oath sworn on the R\u00fctli meadow in 1291 by representatives of three Swiss cantons (territories) against the ambitions of their Habsburg overlords. This sketch, with its limited palette and loose, expressive brushstrokes, shows the artist thinking through questions of tone and mood.</p>\n",
