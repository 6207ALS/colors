    "description": "<p>Jasper Johns has often af\ufb01xed objects to the surfaces of his paintings in an ongoing search for non-illusionistic ways of mediating between the \ufb02at plane of the picture and a fully dimensional world. For his <em>Catenary</em> series (1997\u20132003), of which <em>Near the Lagoon</em> is the largest and last work, Johns formed catenaries\u2014a term used to describe the curve assumed by a cord suspended freely from two points\u2014by tacking ordinary household string to the canvas or its supports. In <em>Near the Lagoon</em>, the string activates and engages the abstract, collaged field of multitonal gray behind it, casting an actual shadow on the canvas, in addition to the painted ones that Johns rendered by hand; the string even creates a rut where the artist embedded it into and later pulled it out of the encaustic.</p>\n",
