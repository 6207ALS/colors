    "copy": " Walter Ellison portrayed a train station in his native Georgia and commented on the racial climate in the United States in the 1930s. White Southerners board trains for vacation destinations, while African Americans journey north to seek jobs during the Great Migration of rural blacks to urban centers such as Detroit and Chicago. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
