    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: American-born Kay Sage is often identified as the wife of the French Surrealist Yves Tanguy. But she was an important artist in her own right, and took part in the historic 1938 Surrealist Exhibition in Paris, alongside better known Europeans such as Max Ernst, Salvador Dali, and Rene Magritte.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: In the Third Sleep was painted during the height of Sage's career. The scenery, with its long, hard shadows, suggests an abandoned settlement out West. But it could easily be out West on another planet. The huge white drapery appears to be either unfolding and rising, or collapsing. On the far horizon, you can just make out what could be a mountain range. It's like the view from an airplane, still an uncommon experience in the mid-1940s.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute has an extensive collection of Surrealist art. Surrealism was more than an art movement, it was a philosophy aimed at liberating the mind, the individual self, and ultimately society. To the Surrealists, the unconscious mind was the ideal source of imagination. In the unconscious they found a dreamlike state that was truer than everyday reality.</p>\n",
