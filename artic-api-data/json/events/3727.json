    "description": "<p><strong>Featuring Yang Wei (pipa), F-Plus Trio, and Unheard-of Ensemble.</strong></p><p>One of the aesthetic impulses of the special exhibition <a href=\"/exhibition/mirroring-china-s-past-emperors-and-their-bronzes\"><em>Mirroring China's Past: Emperors and Their Bronzes</em></a> is in its title: Mirroring China's Past. This concert explores the concept of mirroring a past into the present, specifically with regards to China's cultural history and its modern descendants in America. Traditional works draw inspiration from the past, exploring cultural themes through war and peace that still leave an indelible impression on Chinese people around the world. Contemporary selections cross beyond the mirror to music by young American composers of Chinese descent, who either consciously or subconsciously take inspiration from their ancestral past. On both sides of the mirror, history and bronze play important roles.</p><p><strong>Program</strong></p><p>><em></em><strong>Thomas Kotcheff</strong>: <em><strong>p\u00e1n</strong> [world premi\u00e8re]</em>Joshua Graham, percussionInspired by the exhibition <em>Mirroring China\u2019s Past: Emperors and Their Bronzes</em>, the title refers to the Chinese round curved dish for food, one of the food vessels made during the Chinese Bronze Age. The vibraphone, one of the only metallophones in Western music, is joined by kitchen pans. The timbres of the vibraphone with the pans evoke the sounds of struck bronzes, as they might have been heard throughout Chinese history.</p><p>><em></em><strong>Ancient Battlefields 1</strong><strong>Ancient Battlefields 2</strong>Yang Wei, pipaMr. Yang has united two unrelated pieces to present contrasting themes. One is more violent; the other is more pensive.</p><p>><em></em><strong>The Chen and Sui Dynasties</strong>Yang Wei, pipaThe title refers to two short 6th century dynasties, one following the other: the Chen (557-589) and the Sui (581-618). The interaction of two time periods can be seen as a parallel to the interface of past and future via the exhibit's so-called \"mirror.\" It also reveals how important, historically, strife was to the rise and fall of dynasties, strife that was resolved with weapons made of bronze and other materials.</p><p>><em></em><strong>Huang Ruo: Wind blows...</strong>Yang Wei, pipaDaniel Anastasio, pianoHuang Ruo, in this piece, represents the interface of the past and future. His style, in this music, is based on a traditional Chinese folk song, and yet he is a modern man, using a modern instrument (a piano) with a non-standard technique (continuous rolling), with modern harmonies. <strong>Roger Zare: Lunation 1113</strong>The F-PLUS TrioA lunation is the cycle of the moon's phases, beginning at the new moon and moving through the first quarter to full moon, and then through third quarter to return to new.  Chinese calendar reckonings were traditionally based on movements of the moon as well as the sun, hence the lunisolar calendar and the Lunar New Year.  <strong>Roger Zare: Geometries</strong>The Unheard-of//EnsembleMusical lines are used to imitate geometric ideas. As early as 16th century BC, Chinese artisans fashioned bronze into forms both simple and complex, though complexity often rested on the transformation and manipulation of simple geometric shapes and concepts (cf. details on a huangzhong, the core element in the Chinese Fine Arts Society logo). From simple geometrical principles, one can generate an ornate design that takes on a new idea/shape. <strong>Thomas Kotcheff: bang Z</strong>The F-PLUS Trio and the Unheard-of//EnsembleThe title is derived from the name of a small, high-pitched, Chinese wood block called bangzi. The bangzi is a prominent member of the percussion family in Chinese instruments. Here Kotcheff looks back to an instrument used by his ancestors in a long line of operatic and folk music traditions to generate a new composition that explores the various timbral qualities of the instrument, though represented with other instruments.</p><p><br></p><p>>  </p><p> </p><p>Presented with the Chinese Fine Arts Society</p><p> </p><p>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago. </p><p><strong>About the Artists</strong></p><p><strong >Yang Wei\u2019s</strong> musical education began at age 6.

Yang Wei moved permanently to the United States in 1996, making his home in the Chicago area. </p><p>As a professional musician he has been celebrated worldwide, performing for and inspiring audiences throughout Asia, Europe, and the United States.
