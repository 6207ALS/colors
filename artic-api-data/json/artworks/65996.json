Telephone poles dance over the rise alongside a zigzagging road, illustrating the artist\u2019s consciousness of \u201cthe wonderful everlasting road a leading onward a dipping a rising a leading up over the hill to the sea beyond.\u201d Two important variations in Marin\u2019s approach to mounting and framing can be seen in this and the adjacent watercolor. He eschewed the gilded mounts he had previously favored, instead applying a very thin silver strip around the edge of the sheet and toning the outer margin with a coordinating watercolor wash.</p>\n",
