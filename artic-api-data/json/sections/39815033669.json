In preparation for the exhibition of a selection of these works that took place in November at the Paris \u2202gallery of the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, Gauguin started to write a narration of his two-year stay and enlisted the collaboration of Charles Morice, a thirty-three-year-old poet, writer, and art critic who had gained a reputation as a spokesman for Symbolism, the literary movement that was making headlines and impacting theater, literature, and the visual arts.\n\nFrom the start, Gauguin seems to have wanted images to accompany his text, to which he gave\u2014as to the majority of the works he brought back\u2014a Tahitian title, Noa Noa (no\u2018ano\u2018a, \u201cfragrant\u201d). He also produced many variations on his Tahitian works, most of them in reduced form on paper, employing transfer techniques of the kind used for monotypes, which served to disseminate their compositions. As far as Noa Noa is concerned, the main result of these efforts is what is now called the Noa Noa Suite, a series of ten wood-block prints realized in 1893\u201394, which, when exhibited in the artist\u2019s studio in December 1894, were described as \u201cintermediate between sculpture and painting\u201d and which had an immediate and lasting impact on the art of printmaking. They were less successful, however, in the context of Gauguin\u2019s publication project, which only materialized in 1901, devoid of illustrations and without the artist\u2019s approval.\n\nThis failure was partly due to Morice\u2019s habitual procrastinating, but another responsibility laid with Gauguin\u2019s choices and working methods. He had already had some experience with the multiplication and reproduction of his art. In 1889, on the occasion of an exhibition organized with a group of followers at a caf\u00e9 near the Exposition Universelle, he had published a portfolio (see fig. 1 and cats. 11\u201321) of eleven zincographs\u2014an inexpensive version of lithography\u2014since known as the Volpini Suite, which constituted a compendium of the work he had made recently in Martinique and Brittany. In 1891, at the peak of his collaboration with Symbolist writers, he had produced a few drawings for photomechanical reproduction, including a portrait of the poet Jean Mor\u00e9as for the journal La plume (fig. 2), which would finally publish Noa Noa as a book ten years later. For the Noa Noa Suite, he did not resort to zincography again but rather to wood-block printing, and\u2014as usual with him\u2014he reinvented the technique, carving and printing in highly unusual ways (see fig. 3 [cat. 53.2]; \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d) that proved aesthetically exciting and influential but stood in the way of a collaboration with professional printers and a regular edition. An attempt at producing such an edition with the help of the artist Louis Roy, using stencils and bright colors (see fig. 4 [cat. 53.5]), seems to have left Gauguin unsatisfied.\n\nIn his groundbreaking study of the Noa Noa Suite, published in 1968, Richard Field wrote that Gauguin\u2019s \u201clack of success with the Roy edition\u201d had prompted him \u201cto seek a new means for illustrating Noa Noa.\u201d Field regarded as probable that \u201cthe monotypes of 1894 were to be reproduced in the Gauguin-Morice publication.\u201d In support of this argument, he quoted an unpublished 1897 letter from Morice to Gauguin in which the writer complained that the artist\u2019s \u201cdrawings for Noa Noa\u201d could not be reproduced, because the colors (or tones) did not come through, whereas the grain of the paper did. In the catalogue of his 1973 exhibition of Gauguin\u2019s monotypes, Field corrected his previous statement, specifying that \u201ca group of watercolors, reinforced with pen and charcoal\u201d and executed in 1894, were not monotypes, despite their appearance, and might be \u201cthe granular illustrations\u201d to which Morice had objected in 1897. In the 1988 catalogue for the extensive exhibition of Gauguin\u2019s work shown in Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Paris, Richard Brettell commented on Pape moe (cat. 61) as being one of some thirteen technically related works identified by Field and Peter Zegers, all of them \u201c\u2018dry-brush\u2019 watercolors and wash drawings, for which the paper was kept dry and the image created with a less-than-saturated brush\u201d on \u201ca granular, coarse-textured paper.\u201d\n\nZegers has since attempted to reconstitute the body of drawings that Gauguin must have left with Morice when he departed again for Tahiti in the summer of 1895, hoping that they would be included in the book they were doing together. Observing that the number of these drawings roughly corresponds to the eleven chapters of Noa Noa in the 1901 edition, and supposing that Gauguin may have wished them to be used as frontispieces rather than as illustrations of specific passages, Zegers suggested associating each drawing with a chapter.\n\nAccording to this proposal, the title vignette (fig. 5) would have appeared at the beginning of the book together with a dedication to T\u00e9hura (Teha\u2018amana), Gauguin\u2019s young Tahitian lover and the model for several main figures in his works (see cat. 50, Commentary; cat. 56, Commentary; and cat. 60, Commentary). Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary) (fig. 6 [W 428]) would have served as a frontispiece for chapter 1, Morice\u2019s introductory \u201cPoint de vue\u201d (\u201cViewpoint\u201d), which includes a description of the painting bearing the Tahitian title Ia orana Maria (fig. 7). Man with an Ax (cat. 62) would have been associated with chapter 2, which bears the generic title \u201cLe conteur parle\u201d (\u201cThe Storyteller Speaks\u201d), used for Gauguin\u2019s narration or for the similarly titled chapter 4. A description of the painting Man with an Ax (fig. 8 [W 430]) appears in chapter 2, while chapter 4 includes the famous passage that recounts the narrator\u2019s experience as he goes with a native male friend into the mountains to find a rosewood tree for his sculptures, realizes that he is sexually attracted by the young man walking in front of him, overcomes this temptation, and expiates it by felling the desired tree with his ax, thereby leaving the \u201cdecadent civilized\u201d behind and becoming \u201ca true Maori.\u201d\n\nAlternately, the frontispiece for chapter 2 could have been Two Standing Tahitian Women (fig. 9), referring to the conflict between indigenous specificity and European influence embodied by the narrator\u2019s first local mistress, the mixed-race Titi. Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (see fig. 10) could have opened chapter 3, named by Morice \u201cVivo\u201d after a nasal flute represented by Gauguin in his evocations of the ancient Polynesian religion (see cat. 55, Commentary, and cat. 72, Commentary), given that Gauguin pasted a similar composition in his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 11) when he copied into it the eponymous poem, bearing the equivalent Tahitian title Parau na te varua ino by his collaborator, published in the October 15, 1897, issue of La revue blanche. Pape moe (cat. 61) could have introduced chapter 5, which bears the equivalent title in Tahitian (spelled \u201cPapemo\u00eb\u201d), although the painting that bears the same title (but spelled Pape moe) is described at the end of chapter 4, in the usual manner of a scene witnessed by the narrator. Tahitian Woman and Idol (Hina) (fig. 12 [Rewald 87]) could have been associated with chapter 6, \u201cLe conteur parle,\u201d since the \u201cidol\u201d represents the goddess Hina and the text describes such a statue being honored by the inhabitants of a secluded valley (see cat. 55, Commentary). Chapter 7, entitled \u201cNav\u00e9 nav\u00e9 f\u00e9nua\u201d (\u201cDelightful Land\u201d), evokes again a \u201cfeast to Hina\u201d and the \u201clove dance\u201d leading to a \u201cnight full of signs and of cries\u201d; Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (fig. 13) could have served as its frontispiece.\n\nA drawing (fig. 14) based on the painting Parau hanohano (Terrifying Words) (fig. 15 [W 460]) could accompany chapter 8, \u201cLe conteur parle\u201d (\u201cThe Storyteller Speaks\u201d), which sets forth the \u201ccomplete course in Tahitian theology\u201d provided by T\u00e9hura to the narrator, to the extent that one again recognizes Hina as well as various spirits in it (cat. 52, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works and Commentary). Parau Hina Tefatou (Words between Goddess of the Moon and God of the Earth) (cat. 63) could fit chapter 9, \u201cParahi t\u00e9 mara\u00eb\u201d (\u201cThere the Temple Dwells\u201d), a long poem that mentions in its first lines the moon goddess Hina and the earth deity Tefatu. Finally, a drawing known as Tahitian Legend (fig. 16) might have stood across from the title of chapter 10, \u201cLe conteur parle,\u201d which describes a tuna fishing expedition and a legend involving the god of the sea, Rua Hatu.\n\nThere are strong arguments in favor of Field\u2019s and Zegers\u2019s hypothesis. Morice\u2019s letter of March 1897 attests unequivocally to the existence of a group of drawings that Gauguin wanted reproduced in Noa Noa. Morice mentioned the series again in a letter of May 22, 1901, in which he announced to Gauguin that Noa Noa had been published at his expense by La Plume, reminded the artist that it had been impossible to reproduce his drawings \u201cby collotype\u201d on heavy-grain paper, and asked whether he would allow them to be engraved or send other drawings made on smooth paper. This indicates that Morice had not received an answer to his 1897 letter, in which he had asked, \u201cI wish to know if you authorize me to have them reproduced by an artist who understands you, Seguin for example, or if I should publish the text without.\u201d Armand S\u00e9guin was a twenty-eight-year-old artist specializing in printmaking and book illustration who had become very close to Gauguin during the summer of 1894, introducing mystery into his burgeoning work and experimenting with the woodcut process. In the fall of that year, S\u00e9guin made a woodcut image of Breton women waiting by the sea (fig. 17), accompanied by a versified praise of Gauguin by Morice, and in February 1895, Gauguin wrote a nuanced but appreciative and encouraging preface for the first (and only) exhibition by S\u00e9guin, at the gallery of Louis-L\u00e9on Le Barc de Boutteville, Paris.\n\nIn September 1897, the month preceding the publication of excerpts from Noa Noa in La revue blanche, one of Morice\u2019s poems for Noa Noa appeared independently in the periodical L\u2019image, with vignettes and ornamental frames by S\u00e9guin engraved on wood. The abstract quality of the illustration, importance of the frames, and integration of image and text (see fig. 18) may have been inspired by Gauguin\u2019s manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (see fig. 19), which he had entrusted to Morice, but they also show the influence of Maurice Denis\u2019s conception of illustration as \u201cthe decoration of a book\u201d (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance, fig. 23) as well as the Symbolist model set forth by Carlos Schwabe in his free interpretation of \u00c9mile Zola\u2019s 1888 novel Le r\u00eave (The Dream) (fig. 20). Gauguin could have done something of this kind himself, since he provided a pen-and-ink version of Parau Hina Tefatou to be reproduced photomechanically for the catalogue of his 1893 Paris exhibition (fig. 21). But he seems to have wished to avoid the binary opposition of black and white, just as in his wood-block printing he took an opposite course from F\u00e9lix Vallotton\u2019s radical flatness and abstraction (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance, fig. 32).\n\nOn the other hand, Gauguin could have used zincography, since he had already done so with the Volpini Suite and had produced three zincographs and one lithograph of Tahitian subjects in 1893\u201395, including versions of Parau hanohano (fig. 22 [Kornfeld 24]) and Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary) (fig. 23 [cat. 75.1] [Kornfeld 27]), the latter for inclusion in an issue of a periodical collection of prints entitled L\u2019\u00e9preuve (The Proof). But this would have been more expensive and more difficult to combine with a printed text, whereas Morice appears to have looked for a cheap solution, apologizing in 1901 that what La plume had published was \u201ca very simple volume\u201d and \u201cphysically not very beautiful.\u201d Still there is something bizarre in the notion that a well-connected and experienced artist would have struggled to find a medium suitable for reproduction in a book that was important to him. But maybe the drawings for Noa Noa were not made or chosen out of dissatisfaction with the Roy edition of the Noa Noa Suite but instead as a parallel endeavor, truly meant for the book edition, whereas the wood-block prints were intended for a deluxe edition or a portfolio accompanied by or independent from the text (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). Rather, that only three subjects of the Noa Noa Suite\u2014Title Vignette (see cat. 51, Commentary), Te faruru (see cat. 58, Commentary) and Parau Hina Tefatou (see cat. 53, Commentary)\u2014are present among the drawings speaks to this hypothesis, for, had Gauguin resorted to drawing because of the inadequacy of his prints, it would have been more logical for him to draw new interpretations of the same compositions.\n\nOf course, it may be that Gauguin did not make the drawings specifically to include in the Noa Noa book but only selected them for this purpose among the many variations on his Tahitian works that he was producing at the time; he may also have combined the two approaches. The fact that he drew Parau na te varua ino and Tahitian Legend on the same sheet (fig. 24) suggests that they were executed at the same time and for the same purpose. Tahitian Legend, for which there is no prototype in the paintings and sculptures Gauguin brought back from Tahiti, has a strongly narrative character. This is unusual in the artist\u2019s oeuvre, except for a few sheets in Ancien culte mahorie, such as the double-page spread relating the story of Rua Hatu (fig. 25), which deals with the same subject as Tahitian Legend. More clearly than the watercolor on folio 19V of the manuscript, the drawing shows the deity emerging from the depths to find out who or what had awakened him with a hook that had become entangled in his hair. Discovering that a man was responsible, the god decided to punish humankind with a deluge (see cat. 54, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works and Commentary). The image abounds in Gauguin\u2019s typical visual puns, including a lock of Rua Hatu\u2019s hair extending from his forehead like a menacing hook toward the culprit and an uncanny mask/face superimposed on the fisherman\u2019s torso (fig. 26), similar to the one perched like a hanging fruit on the serpentine tree branch in Parau na te varua ino and echoing the head of the v\u0101rua \u2018ino, or \u201cevil spirit,\u201d that is seated frontally behind Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian Eve (fig. 27 [W 458]).\n\nGauguin obviously drew the four lines in black chalk framing the image while making it, since they interrupt the composition, and he was careful not to transgress them with wash. In the case of the drawing Parau na te varua ino (fig. 10), the artist could have added the frame after he completed the image, but this is improbable given the similar sizes and regular disposition of the two compositions on the page (fig. 24). Five other drawings from the series identified by Zegers are similarly framed\u2014in one case, that of Two Standing Tahitian Women (fig. 9), in an irregular shape. Closer examination would be necessary to ascertain whether this was done from the start or ex post facto to ensure greater homogeneity. At any rate, this homogeneity is quite relative. It appears greatest between the title vignette (fig. 5), which explicitly refers to the book project by incorporating the initials C and M (for Charles Morice) in addition to PG (for Paul Gauguin); Parau na te varua ino; Parau Hina Tefatou (cat. 63), and Tahitian Legend (fig. 16), whereas Ia orana Maria (fig. 23 [cat 75.1]) and Pape moe (cat. 61) distinguish themselves because of the extensive use of color they exhibit, which makes them particularly unfit for the photomechanical reproduction envisioned by Morice. But could these be the teintes (colors or tones) that he said did not come through? The dry-brush effect on heavy-grain paper should not have been so difficult to transmit, given that the aforementioned portrait of Jean Mor\u00e9as by Gauguin (fig. 2) appears to have been drawn in an analogous way on the same kind of support. To complicate matters even more, five out of the eleven drawings, including Ia orana Maria, are marked with the monogram stamp (see fig. 6) that Gauguin carved in Brittany during the summer of 1894 to use mostly on watercolor transfer monotypes he made that year.\n\nThe notion that Gauguin wanted his drawings to function as frontispieces to the individual chapters, rather than illustrate specific passages of the text, is convincing in the light of the artist\u2019s misgivings about illustration and about writers\u2019 claims to a primacy of the written word over the visual arts (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d), but the attribution of individual drawings to individual chapters proposed by Zegers is\u2014like his identification of their group as a whole\u2014plausible and useful, not certain and definitive. Man with an Ax (cat. 62), for instance, could not only introduce chapter 2 and chapter 4, as mentioned above, but also chapter 1, which contains the first mention of the young man cutting a tree trunk with an ax, or chapter 5, in which Morice\u2019s verses unfold the metaphoric and mythopoeic dimensions of the woodcutter. To some extent, this is an inevitable result of Gauguin\u2019s way of endlessly varying and combining visual and textual motifs, rendered even more intricate\u2014and at times repetitive\u2014by Morice\u2019s interventions. It is probable that a clear answer to these questions will be obtained only if additional documents related to the exchange between the two men about their common project become available.\n\nDiscussing each of these drawings individually exceeds the frame of this study, which must limit itself to examining the three that are in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nParau Hina Tefatou (cat. 63) represents the words between Hina and Tefatu, that is, the dialogue entitled \u201c\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de la mati\u00e8re\u201d (\u201cEternity of Matter\u201d), which Gauguin copied from Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an in Ancien culte mahorie (see fig. 28). According to this legend, Hina, as genius or goddess of the moon\u2014indicated in the drawing by a crescent above her head\u2014asks the genius or god of the earth, Tefatu, to grant humans life after death. He refuses, declaring that they must perish like plants and the earth itself, whereas Hina allows her realm\u2014the moon and what it contains\u2014to live again. Gauguin\u2019s illustration of this dialogue in Ancien culte mahorie grants the two deities equal status and emphasizes their sexual polarity. In the cylindrical sculpture Hina and Fatu (Hina and Tefatou) (fig. 29 [Gray 96]), on the other hand, their postures are asymmetrical: Tefatu\u2019s right arm plunges into the ground, whereas Hina raises her right hand toward his face. Her gesture appears to derive from that of a woman being attended at a feast in the wall decoration of an Egyptian tomb (fig. 30), of which Gauguin owned a photograph that he repeatedly used as a model (cat. 54, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 18). Jehanne Teilhet-Fisk compared the hand gesture to the abhayamudr\u0101 position in Buddhist iconography and interpreted it as a sign of \u201cappeasement,\u201d expressing Hina\u2019s promise that \u201cthrough death there is an assurance of rebirth.\u201d The same gesture appears in Parau Hina Tefatou, as well as in the close-cropped pen-and-ink version reproduced in the catalogue of the 1893 exhibition (fig. 21) and in Te atua (The God) (fig. 31). Also shared by the sculpture, the wood-block print, and the drawings are the different eye forms used for Hina and for Tefatu and the presence on their bodies and faces of tattoos, evocative of scarifications around Hina\u2019s eye and navel.\n\nThe choice of the motif of Parau Hina Tefatou as the frontispiece for the Durand-Ruel exhibition catalogue indicates that it was central to Gauguin\u2019s understanding of his Tahitian works, and this is confirmed by the fact that Morice began his preface by recounting the \u201cEternity of Matter\u201d dialogue. But his text soon dispels the notion of a harmonious encounter and of an \u201cappeasing\u201d goddess: according to Morice, Hina\u2019s suggestion to let humans resuscitate was \u201cthe misleading advice given by the female element to the male one, the sterilizing advice of false pity,\u201d and Gauguin approved Tefatu\u2019s refusal,\u201cfor life can only be fecundated in death, and the moon, because it refused to die, became a pale, useless phantom of life.\u201d Morice referred to the painting Hina Tefatou (The Moon and the Earth) (fig. 32 [W 499]), included in the exhibition, in which he saw \u201ca caressing and feeble woman gently catching the God by the hair\u201d and beseeching him in vain. This interpretation does justice to the composition, in which the gender roles\u2014defined in an exacerbated mutual opposition\u2014clearly favor the \u201cmale element,\u201d and it seems fair to use it for throwing light on Parau Hina Tefatou and related images: Hina\u2019s gesture is one of pleading rather than appeasement, and her more naturalistic treatment corresponds to the fact that, in her sympathetic concern for the preservation of human life, she is less \u201cuntamed\u201d and authentic a Polynesian god than is Tefatu.\n\nIn these works, Gauguin accentuated Tefatu\u2019s masculinity by giving him a moustache and a goatee (or a full beard in the painting), an element that Teilhet-Fisk found striking, since Tahitians did not wear either, and goatees are absent from Oceanic art except for that of Easter Island (see fig. 33). This addition may also point to an identification of Gauguin, who wore facial hair, with the figure of Tefatu, a possibility made stronger by its resemblance to the artist\u2019s self-portrait (fig. 34 [Gray 109]), inscribed Oviri (\u2018\u014dviri), a Tahitian word for \u201cwild, untamed.\u201d Teilhet-Fisk observed that, in Parau Hina Tefatou, \u201cTefatou\u2019s foot has taken on the appearance of a lizard\u2019s foot,\u201d connecting him with the animal that Gauguin used\u2014in the absence of snakes\u2014as a symbol of the temptation of evil (see cat. 56, Commentary). Since Gauguin also depicted himself as a tempter in the relief Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (Be In Love and You Will Be Happy) (1889; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), this feature strengthens the notion that Tefatu possesses an element of self-representation.\n\nThe drawing Man with an Ax (cat. 62) is based on the eponymous painting (fig. 8), which bears no inscription but was included in the 1893 exhibition under the title L\u2019homme \u00e0 la hache. The same figure of a woodcutter, wearing only a loin cloth and holding his tool with both hands above his head, appears in the painting Matamoe (Landscape with Peacocks) (fig. 35 [W 484]) as well as in two other works on paper that Gauguin probably made in France after his return from Tahiti: the study Standing Tahitian Man Swinging a Hatchet, and Two Seated Women (fig. 36) and the colored finished drawing Man with an Ax (fig. 37 [cat. 47]). As already mentioned, there are two main passages in Noa Noa\u2014both included in the draft manuscript\u2014with which this image can be associated. In the first passage, set in the district of Mataiea, where the narrator settles after leaving Papeete, the painting is described as a scene of everyday life witnessed by the sea, while its metaphysical significance is expressed metaphorically: the ax leaves \u201cits incision on the dead tree, which would instantly live once more a moment of flames\u2014age-old heat, treasured up each day,\u201d and the dry pandanus leaves on the ground spell out the Oceanic name of God. In the second, the narrator destroys \u201cthe old remnant of civilized man\u201d in himself by savagely wielding an ax to cut down a rosewood tree that he needs to make sculptures. The theme of death and rebirth present in both passages also informs Matamoe (translated as Mort [\u201cDeath\u201d] in the 1893 catalogue), where the fire liberating the energy accumulated in the fallen tree can be seen lying on the ground behind its limbs.\n\nIn the drawing heightened with gouache (fig. 37), the woman described in the text as \u201cstowing some nets in the pirogue\u201d has disappeared, as has the manned sailboat, but the scene\u2019s other elements are present. The Art Institute\u2019s dry-brush drawing (cat. 62), however, dispenses with them altogether to focus on the male figure, placed against a dark background, from which emerges at the bottom a fallen tree trunk, missing in the other works except for Matamoe. Charles Stuckey observed that the female figure is also missing from the sonnet \u201cafter and for P. Gauguin\u201d and entitled \u201cL\u2019homme \u00e0 la hache\u201d that Alfred Jarry included in his first collection of texts, Les minutes de sable m\u00e9morial (The Minutes of Memorial Sand), in the fall of 1894. Stuckey supposed therefore that Gauguin made the colored drawing \u201cin Pont-Aven during Jarry\u2019s visit in June and early July of 1894,\u201d and that the artist may even have intended it \u201cto serve as an illustration for Jarry\u2019s text.\u201d Whatever the case, Jarry had little interest in the sexual charge of the woman leaning over in the boat, whereas he was sensitive to the standing man\u2019s erotic appeal. Alongside the passage of the draft manuscript of Noa Noa relating the narrator\u2019s attraction to the young man preceding him on the path, Gauguin took note of points to be developed, starting with \u201cthe androgynous side of the savage, the little difference between the sexes in animals\u201d; indeed, his woodcutter can, to a certain degree, be described as androgynous. His relaxed, almost languid attitude is as far as possible from the hyperbolic virility of Ferdinand Hodler\u2019s later Woodcutter (fig. 38), for example.\n\nWith his light contrapposto, Gauguin\u2019s figure stands in the tradition of the male nude epitomized by Polykleitos\u2019s Doryphoros (c. 440 B.C., known from marble copies) and rejuvenated by Auguste Rodin\u2019s Age of Bronze (fig. 39). Rodin\u2019s youth, evoking primitive man, was originally meant to hold a spear in his left hand, but the sculptor renounced all attributes so as to increase the figure\u2019s ambiguity. If one took the ax away from Gauguin\u2019s woodcutter, it would be difficult to guess what he is holding or doing; the artist did not take great pains to render plausible the position of his hands or the relationships between tool, agent, and target. Although the tree trunk makes an appearance in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, verisimilitude is at its lowest as far as the ax is concerned, since the blade is turned against the direction in which it moves and seems to wave as if it were a flag. But maybe Gauguin did wish to suggest movement after all\u2014the \u201cblue imprint on the silvery sky,\u201d symmetrical to the incision on the tree, so beautifully evoked textually in Noa Noa. The implausibility of the woodcutter\u2019s pose is partly explained by the fact that Gauguin did not derive it from observation of a live model but rather adapted it from the figure of a standing horseman in the west frieze of the Parthenon, which he knew from the phototypes of casts from portions of the Panathenaic frieze made by his tutor Gustave Arosa and published in 1868 in a monograph by the critic Charles Yriarte (see fig. 40). William Kane, who discovered the source, compared this borrowing with the second passage from Noa Noa, in which \u201cthe cathartic and frenzied act of felling\u201d the rosewood tree leads to the narrator\u2019s \u201cpsychic rebirth,\u201d and considered that the latter \u201cfunctions as a lyrical antithesis of the image of the Greco-Tahitian man with an axe, whose harmonious gestures . . . express through their controlled freedom an ideal, primitive condition of purity and grace towards which the artist personally strove.\u201d\n\nFinally, a compositional element specific to the Art Institute\u2019s drawing is the dark, almond shape surrounding the woodcutter. It serves to isolate and enhance the figure in the tradition of the Romantic vignette, and the transgression of its boundary by the ax accentuates the combination of movement and repose in the man\u2019s posture. But it also evokes the visual devices magnifying holy figures in religious art, especially Christ\u2019s mandorla (\u201calmond\u201d in Italian) and the frequently used horseshoe shape surrounding the Buddha, for instance on the relief from the temple of Borobudur, of which Gauguin owned a photograph (fig. 41), which inspired his depiction of the Polynesian creator god Ta\u2018aroa in his wood-block print Te atua (The God) (fig. 3 [cat. 53.2]). Given the explicit references to Buddhism present in the Noa Noa passages related to Man with an Ax, this connection is clearly relevant, as is that between the topknot or ushnisha crowning the Buddha and the almond shape in Gauguin\u2019s drawing located just above the woodcutter\u2019s head. The latter\u2019s action is thus \u201cdecoratively\u201d associated with the teaching of the Buddha, a link effected in the text when the narrator sings, while felling the rosewood tree, two verses from the Dhammapada (collection of sayings of the Buddha), enjoining the reader to \u201ccut the wood\u201d of desires and to \u201ccut off affection for oneself.\u201d And since Gauguin\u2019s interest in Buddhism was inevitably colored by its current importance for the Theosophists, whose \u201csecret doctrine\u201d was often dubbed \u201cesoteric Buddhism,\u201d one may wonder if he knew of their interpretation of the religious nimbus as expressing the \u201cinvisible bodies\u201d or principles of man, prior to the illustrations of Charles W. Leadbeater\u2019s Man Visible and Invisible (see fig. 42) and their artistic incorporation by Odilon Redon (see fig. 43).\n\nThe watercolor drawing Pape moe (cat. 61) is based on the painting of the same name (fig. 44 [W 498]), which Gauguin executed shortly before his return to France and then included in his 1893 exhibition with its Tahitian title translated as Eau myst\u00e9rieuse (Mysterious water). Pape stands for \u201cfresh water\u201d (see cat. 59, Commentary), while moe means \u201csleep\u201d and \u201cdream\u201d as a noun and \u201cto sleep, to lie down\u201d as a verb. This theme was important to Gauguin, who devoted to it the principal part of a decorative ensemble carved in recycled oak-panel doors during his 1894 stay in Brittany (see fig. 45 [Gray 107]). The original disposition of the panels comprising this ensemble is not known; Christopher Gray claimed that the relief was \u201ccut into individual pieces\u201d at some point. In the earliest photograph documenting the work, a view of the stunning display of Gustave Fayet\u2019s collection of Gauguin paintings and sculptures in the studio of his residence at the Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Igny northeast of Paris around 1914 (fig. 46), the ensemble is divided in three parts on both sides of an overmantel topped with the relief Soyez myst\u00e9rieuses (Be Mysterious) (1890 [Gray 132): on the left are the two horizontal panels Hina\u2019s Head and Two Vivo Players (fig. 47 [Gray 107.III]]) and Scene of Worship with Head of Hina in Profile (fig. 48 [Gray 107.II.]) within one frame, followed by the vertical Profile of a Tupapau and Other Spirits (fig. 49 Gray 107.I]). On the right side of the overmantel mirror is the polychrome panel corresponding to the Pape moe composition.\n\nAs with Man with an Ax, Gauguin included Pape moe as a narrative scene in Noa Noa:\n\nReaching a detour. / What I saw. Description of the picture of Pape moe. / I had made no sound. When she had finished drinking, she took water in her hands and poured it between her breasts; then, as an uneasy antelope instinctively senses a stranger, she gazed hard at the thicket where I was hidden. Briskly she dived, crying out the word \u2018taehae . . . \u2019 (cruel). I rushed to look down into the water\u2014vanished. Only a huge eel writhed between the small stones of the bottom.\n\nThe composition of Pape moe is based on a photograph by Charles-Georges Spitz (fig. 50) that Gauguin could have discovered in the Tahitian section of the 1888 Exposition Universelle in Paris, to which the photographer had contributed. The photograph represents a boy leaning to drink from a waterfall in the valley of Fautaua, not far from Papeete, which Pierre Loti had described as a primeval place of \u201cextravagant vegetation\u201d in his 1880 novel Le mariage de Loti. The Noa Noa story may have resulted from the same imaginative reenactment of the scene as the painting. Gauguin was also probably struck by the similarity of position\u2014and to some extent of situation\u2014between the Tahitian boy in Spitz\u2019s picture and that of the reluctant Breton girl in his own Two Bathers of 1887 (fig. 51 [W 215, [glossary:W2002] 241]; see also cat. 5, Commentary). Without naming the Tahitian surprised by the narrator near the waterfall, the text uses the feminine and mentions her breasts, whereas the painting and the works derived from it show a figure as androgynous as the young Breton bather\u2014apart from the long hair\u2014and conceal its bust behind the left arm in agreement with both of its prototypes.\n\nAsked early in 1895 by the journalist Jean Tardieu why he had gone to Tahiti, Gauguin answered, \u201cIn order to produce something new, you have to return to the original source, to the childhood of mankind.\u201d A young Tahitian drinking from a source was therefore the perfect visualization of this ideal, and Gauguin may have wanted to make a primitivist contribution to a theme that had already inspired celebrated academic (see fig. 52) and realist (see fig. 53) treatments. But the connection with Two Bathers, and especially the hesitating maiden, suggests, like the epitaph \u201cEt in Arcadia ego\u201d in Nicolas Poussin\u2019s Shepherds of Arcadia (fig. 54), that temptation, the Fall, and death have found their way into this tropical paradise (see cat. 6, Commentary, and cat. 59, Commentary). In Tahitian terms, the writing on the wall takes the form of the dialogue between Hina and Tefatu. In Noa Noa, the passage narrating the Pape moe scene is immediately followed by a call for the \u201clegend of Tefatu.\u201d Visually, the connection is made explicit in a watercolor version of the theme (fig. 55) in which a medallion with the heads of Hina and Tefatu appears to be the source out of which the young Tahitian is about to drink, and an ironic inscription casts doubt on the wisdom of this consummation: \u201cQu\u2019importe la source / Si l\u2019eau est d\u00e9licieuse\u201d (\u201cNever mind the source, as long as the water is delicious\u201d). In the later versions of Noa Noa, the legend of Tefatu evoked at the foot of Mount Aorai describes the composition of the painting Hina Tefatou (The Moon and the Earth) (fig. 32), which bears a clear resemblance to that of the oil painting Pape moe (fig. 44): the supplicant Hina brings a lock of Tefatu\u2019s hair \u2014or vegetation growing on it\u2014to her lips much like the Tahitian approaches the water; so too the god\u2019s bust appears on top of plant stems that suggest falling water and end similarly in a pool at the bottom.\n\nIn the painting Pape moe, Hina and Tefatu remain invisible, but the wall of vegetation surrounding the waterfall brims with iconic suggestions. Field singled out a \u201cfish head which forms the mysterious source of the water\u201d and appears just in front of the Tahitian, who looks up at it rather than at the water. One can dispute whether the origin of the water should be located in this head or\u2014as in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing (cat. 61)\u2014in the branch of flowers grasped by the figure, but the head resembles one of the ti\u2018is included in the wood-block print L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (see cat. 54, Commentary) and thus belongs to the primeval world of Polynesian deities. In Noa Noa, Gauguin clearly suggested that the Tahitian may have changed herself into an eel\u2014depicted only in the drawing (fig. 56)\u2014so as to escape the narrator. Commentators on the painting have proposed various Tahitian legends to account for the waterfall, fish head, and eel, but the artist made no reference to them and could also have been inspired, on a more general level, by the European tradition of mythological metamorphoses. He may, for instance, have thought of Daphne, changed into a tree when chased by Apollo, or, in relation to the voyeuristic situation that he rightly perceived in Spitz\u2019s photograph, of Acteon, turned into a stag when he chanced upon the bathing Artemis. Stuckey described Hina Tefatou (fig. 32) as presenting \u201ca naked woman who beholds an apparition of a male head in the grotto wall.\u201d Indeed, in many cultural traditions, grottoes are places of epiphanies. More specifically, the way in which Gauguin depicted the natural environment of the waterfall and Tefatu\u2019s manifestation as preserves of pre-Christian ontologies recalls Mannerist grottoes in which nature itself seems to give birth to a world of animals and pagan deities (see fig. 57).\n\nWhen referring to Gauguin\u2019s sensitivity toward natural or accidental images, Field spoke of a process of \u201ccrystallization\u201d providing \u201cthe raw visualization for as yet unvisualized ideas and/or feelings,\u201d and David Sweetman imagined that Gauguin may have \u201cfound\u201d the fish head while painting. Such an accidental genesis is highly improbable, however, given the artist\u2019s belief in a continuity between natural and artistic processes and his long-standing interest in imaginative perception and poetic suggestion. To be precise, Noa Noa suggests that the narrator may be wondering whether the eel is not what the Tahitian had become. In an episode added later, the story of the Grotto of Mara, the narrator first describes roots growing \u201camong the crevices in the rocks\u201d as \u201cenormous serpents,\u201d and, thinking he sees a sea tortoise floating by as he swims, asks himself, \u201cWas I mad or had I become a true Maori, subject to their myths and superstitions.\u201d It seems probable, therefore, that the more or less inchoate images populating the \u201cmysterious\u201d world of Pape moe evoke not only the physical and mental environment of its human protagonist, but also, in a self-reflexive way, that of the spectator and artist faced by this environment. In the painting, reflections or leaves in the water recall the uncanny faces of Aha oe feii? (What! Are You Jealous?) and Auti te pape (Women at the River) (see cat. 59, Commentary); in the watercolor drawing (cat. 61), the artist\u2019s monogram is comingled with a vegetal ornament, and a bald human head in profile appears to the right of the eel\u2019s head (see fig. 56).\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s watercolor has lost much of its brightness due to exposure to light, yet it still depends on color for much of its effect. If it really belonged to the drawings Gauguin gave to Morice to be photomechanically reproduced, no wonder this proved to be a failure, due, perhaps a second time, to the artist being carried away by his love of experimentation (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). But these drawings represent Gauguin\u2019s continual need to vary his Tahitian compositions, disseminate them, strengthen the fabric formed by their mutual relationships, and even to explicate them\u2014in the etymological sense of \u201cunfolding\u201d their formal and semantic potentialities. A few would find their way into publications about Gauguin, especially those by Morice, and even, as early as 1914, on the cover of the first Russian edition of Noa Noa (fig. 58).  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See http://www.farevanaa.pf/dictionnaire.php, http://www.arapo.org.pf/dico.html, accessed Dec. 15, 2015; see also cat. 51, Commentary.\n\nSee Richard S.

The visual reconstruction proposed by Gray is not entirely convincing. Its only validating element in the composition of the parts is a curved framing line passing from the bottom of Profile of a Tupapau and Other Spirits to that of Scene of Worship with Head of Hina in Profile. A diagonal structural division in the lower part of Profile of a Tupapau and Other Spirits and its interrupted counterpart in the top right corner would lead one to assume the Profile of a Tupapau and Other Spirits] to have been the left element of a decorated frame: Hina\u2019s Head and Two Vivo Players and Scene of Worship with Head of Hina in Profile, being identical in size, could have been (part of) the upper and lower elements (they must have been pendants, but their combination in the Fayet collectionseems arbitrary). The role of right element attributed by Gray to Pape moe proper, a polychrome relief and a compositionally self-sufficient entity, is much more difficult to justify. One would have to imagine something\u2014a painting? another relief? a mirror? a window?\u2014occupying the space between the four elements and justifying their arrangement.\n\nFor the individual pieces, see Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, with Charlotte Hale and Marjorie Shelley, Gauguin in New York Collections: The Lure of the Exotic, exh. cat.

Richard S. Field compared Courbet\u2019s 1862 The Source to Gauguin\u2019s painting Hina Tefatou (fig. 34); Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Voyage to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), figs. 74 and 75.\n\nFor general observations on this question, see in particular Werner Hofmann, \u201cGauguin malt das Paradies und das Wissen um seinen Verlust,\u201d in Paul Gauguin: Das verlorene Paradies, ed.

The irony is similar to that of the 1889 relief inscribed Soyez amoureuses vous serez heureuses (Be in Love and You Will Be Happy [Gray 76]).\n\nPaul Gauguin, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, 1893\u20131901, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, RF 7259, p. 88; Paul Gauguin and Charles Morice, Noa Noa (La Plume, 1901), p. 96.\n\nRichard S. Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Voyage to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), p. 190.\n\nBengt Danielsson connected the waterfall with \u201cthe well-known Tahitian and Polynesian myth of the magic water (actually flood of light) of the god Tane, which among other things imparts new life to Hina, enabling her (i.e. the moon) to be reborn every month\u201d; Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas (Doubleday, 1965), p. 134. Richard S. Field mentioned the myth that described Tahiti as a fish that swam away from the leeward group of the Society Islands; Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Voyage to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), p. 192. Nicholas Wadley referred to \u201cseparate Polynesian legends describing respectively a princess diving through a \u2018hole\u2019 in a river into the underworld, and a royal eel who was King of Lake Vaihiria\u201d; Wadley, ed., Noa Noa: Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti, trans. Jonathan Griffin (Phaidon, 1985), p. 114. In a long poem entitled Papemo\u00eb included in Noa Noa, Charles Morice made the source motif part of an elaborate construction in which water springs from the foot of the \u201cbaleful tree\u201d that is felled by the man with the ax; to those who drink from it and re-embrace the practice of human sacrifice, it promises a return to the glorious past. See Paul Gauguin, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, 1893\u20131901, pp. 89\u201392, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris; and Paul Gauguin and Charles Morice, Noa Noa (La Plume, 1901), pp. 97\u2013118. It is unclear to what extent Gauguin, who copied the poem in his manuscript, agreed with its interpretation of his works.\n\nOvid, Metamorphoses, 1, 452\u201367; 3, 131\u2013252.\n\nCharles F.

For Field this process \u201cverges on the 20th century phenomenon of auto-suggestion.\u201d Charles F.

However, this interest in and artistic use of what was then called \u201csuggestion\u201d is actually typical of the late nineteenth century; see Dario Gamboni, Potential Images: Ambiguity and Indeterminacy in Modern Art (Reaktion, 2002), pp. 68\u2013130, 168\u2013200.\n\nSee Dario Gamboni, Paul Gauguin: The Mysterious Centre of Thought, trans.

The decorative frame of the cover is borrowed from the pareu motifs of the 1892 painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo [W 457]) and makes a clever use of their physiognomic qualities; see Dario Gamboni, Paul Gauguin: The Mysterious Centre of Thought, trans.
