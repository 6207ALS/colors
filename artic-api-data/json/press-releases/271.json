    "copy": " Wednesday, May 8, 2019   CHICAGO\u2014 With a tightly chosen selection of over 31 stunning and important pictures, the Art Institute of Chicago presents Iconic: Photographs from the Robin and Sandy Stuart Collection , on view May 11 through August 14 in the Modern Wing\u2019s Bucksbaum Gallery for Photography.   Collectors Robin and Sandy Stuart have spent four decades acquiring an impressive number of exemplary modernist photographs made between 1920 and 1970. Artistically ambitious photographers in this breakthrough era argued for honest or \u201cstraight\u201d images\u2014reality-based, sharply focused\u2014and emphasized the craft of photographic printing. Equally important, they staked their reputation on subjects that were brand-new \u2014 for example the Chrysler Building \u2014 or entirely ordinary, such as a humble pepper.   Edward Weston\u2019s Peppers are the definition of an iconic photograph in these terms: one that becomes famous as art \u201con its own terms.\u201d From the pyramids to the Mona Lisa, photography has long helped make other works of art iconic. The photographs in this exhibition, by contrast, have achieved iconic status \u201csimply\u201d as pictures. The stories of how they became icons, however, are not simple\u2014in fact they are part of the complicated history of photography as a form of fine art.   Matthew Witkovsky, Sandor Chair and Curator of Photography, notes the Stuarts\u2019 steadfast commitment to photography and to the Art Institute: \u201cWith understated enthusiasm and discernment, Sandy and Robin have assembled an array of photographs by Berenice Abbott, Tina Modotti, Paul Strand, and others that are memorable as images and utterly unforgettable in their print quality. They have also stepped forward, always quietly but with an adventuresome spirit, to enable the museum to purchase photographs by venerable and emerging artists in equal measure. Iconic is a show that we can admire and learn from at once.\u201d   Indeed, Iconic will prominently display a 30-part work by Jim Goldberg, Rich and Poor , that took years (1977-1984) to make \u2014 not the typical fraction of a second \u2014 and stands opposed to the exquisitely crafted, single image that features elsewhere in the exhibition. Goldberg met with wealthy and working-class individuals in their homes and had them express their point of view in handwritten comments around his photographs. The Stuarts bought Rich and Poor when it was first shown and have gifted it to the Art Institute. ",
