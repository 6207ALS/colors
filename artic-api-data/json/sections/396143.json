As in family photographs and in the artist\u2019s drawings of the late 1890s, Mrs. Philip appears in the mourning dress and black headcovering that she adopted after Beatrix Whistler\u2019s death in 1896. The image was almost certainly drawn in 1897, when Whistler made frequent trips to Paris. During these sojourns he stayed at the house on the rue du Bac, where members of his late wife\u2019s family often gathered around him. The tea table in the foreground of the scene helps to identify the location; it was part of the drawing-room furnishings of the Paris residence and appears in two other lithographs, La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99) and The Sisters (cat. 109).\n\nIn his volume of reminiscences, publisher-dealer Ambroise Vollard wrote of visiting Whistler\u2019s studio to ask him \u201cto give me a lithograph for my album of painter-gravers.\u201d He had apparently expected the artist to reject summarily a request from someone so \u201cyoung and quite unknown to him.\u201d Instead Whistler invited him to stay and share a simple lunch in the studio. Vollard provided no details of their discussions regarding the inclusion of a lithograph in his projected publication, but he did record Whistler\u2019s preoccupation with the Eden trial, which helps to date their encounter. It has previously been assumed that Vollard\u2019s meeting with Whistler occurred in March 1895, when the first Eden trial took place, and that Afternoon Tea must therefore date from early that year. However, Whistler\u2019s appeal of the verdict of the first Eden trial was held in Paris in late November 1897, and the artist was busy with preparations for those hearings from the time he returned to Paris in mid-October. It seems likely that his meeting with Vollard occurred in the autumn of 1897, and that Whistler\u2014who tended to favor his newest work for publication\u2014had only recently drawn Afternoon Tea. The 1897 dating is supported by the mourning clothes worn by his mother-in-law and by a note written to Whistler by St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 on 7 November 1897 that included the following remark: \u201cVollard, who is very pleased, must have sent it to the printer, and will mail you a proof.\u201d It seems reasonable to conclude that the poet referred to the printing of Whistler\u2019s lithograph for Vollard\u2019s L\u2019Album d\u2019estampes originales de la Galerie Vollard, which was exhibited at the Galerie Vollard in December 1897.\n\nAfternoon Tea was printed in Paris by Auguste Clot, who had at one time been employed by the Lemercier firm. An edition of one hundred impressions was printed on a fine-quality Japanese vellum for Vollard\u2019s album. Clot also printed a number of impressions outside of the edition on a variety of other papers. There were forty-five impressions of this lithograph remaining in Clot\u2019s estate in 1954. The printer probably destroyed the stone. In her inventory of the lithographs in Whistler\u2019s estate, Rosalind Birnie Philip wrote \u201cdoubtful whether stone exists\u201d beside the entry for this image, and mistakenly identified the printer as Lemercier.\n\nChicago: SC, grayish ivory China paper (242 \u00d7 209 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3), grayish ivory chine (204 \u00d7 162 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (420 \u00d7 281 mm); cream Japanese paper (294 \u00d7 223 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (331 \u00d7 206 mm) laid down on cream card (337 \u00d7 210 mm; a modern mount).\n\nRemarks: Another mounted impression is found in Brooklyn, TBM.\n\nPublished edition. Auguste Clot printed an edition of one hundred impressions of Afternoon Tea (or La Conversation, as it was titled in the album) for inclusion in Ambroise Vollard\u2019s L\u2019Album d\u2019estampes originales de la Galerie Vollard, issued in 1897. The second of two such albums, it contained thirty-two prints by thirty-one artists. Whistler\u2019s lithograph\u2014the smallest in the folio\u2014was printed on tan laid Japanese vellum that was attached to a secondary mount with adhesive applied to the verso along the length of the left edge of each sheet. None of the impressions examined in the preparation of this catalogue are numbered, nor do any remain attached to their original mounts. It is likely that numbers were inscribed on these secondary mounts.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid Japanese vellum (397 \u00d7 243 mm), signed; MWC, tan laid Japanese vellum (397 \u00d7 242 mm), signed; Palmer, tan laid Japanese vellum (400 \u00d7 243 mm).

Dumont; NGA, tan laid Japanese vellum (397 \u00d7 244 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other impressions from Vollard\u2019s album are found in Boston, BPL; Cambridge, FAM; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.  \nNesta R.

Cat. 146, p. 59, reads: \u201cTwo ladies, Mrs. Philip and Mrs. Charles Whibley, at tea.\u201d A related pen-and-ink drawing also depicts the mother and daughter; MacDonald (1995), p. 522, no. 1457 (\"Final Accomplishments,\" fig. 5)\n\nAmbroise Vollard, Recollections of a Picture Dealer, trans. Violet M. MacDonald (Boston, 1936), pp. 193\u201395.\n\nThe 1895 date for the meeting between Vollard and Whistler was proposed by Pat Gilmour; Gilmour (1988), p. 372 n. 104. Gilmour also suggested that at the end of their discussion Vollard took away with him two drawings on transfer paper, Afternoon Tea and Mother and Daughter (cat. 174). On the Eden trial, see cat. 115, esp. n. 1.\n\nWhistler\u2019s work may have been among the last to be added to the second album. In fact, by early July Vollard seems to have been already laying the groundwork for a third, unrealized album. On 3 July 1897 he wrote to Auguste Clot informing him that he would be editioning Emile Blanche\u2019s plate for the third album, rather than for the second one, because he \u201cdid not wish to have the same artists using the same process as in the first year\u201d; Vollard to Auguste Clot, 3 July 1897, transcribed in Gilmour (1988), p. 176, letter 2.\n\n\u201cVollard, enchant\u00e9, a du envoyer a l\u2019imprimeur et vous faire tenir une epreuve\u201d; Mallarm\u00e9 to Whistler, 7 November 1897, Barbier (1964), letter CLV, p. 271.\n\nSee Gilmour (1988), p. 160.
