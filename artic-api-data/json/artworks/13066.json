    "description": "<p>Dufy was a painter associated in the early part of his career with the Fauves (&quot;wild beasts&quot;), known for their bold colors and sweeping brushstrokes. In 1909 he met the couturier <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36223\">Paul Poiret</a>, who encouraged his textile work. Dufy established a textile production workshop, which Poiret supported financially, but it closed when Dufy was hired in 1912 to design textiles for the Lyons firm of Bianchini-F\u00e9rier. Dufy and Poiret remained friends and collaborated throughout their relationship. For the most part, Dufy's textiles reflect either his brightly colored paintings or his fondness for woodcuts, as seen here.</p>\n",
