    "description": "<p>Noted for its high-quality craftsmanship in metal accessories, tableware, and jewelry, the Kalo Shop was established in 1900 by Clara P. Barck in Chicago. By 1905, Barck had organized a community of designers, apprentices, and metalsmiths at her home in Park Ridge, Illinois, which became known as the Kalo Art-Craft Community. In about 1910, Mildred Belle Bevis became a student in the Park Ridge group and was later among the first teachers in the silversmithing school associated with the Kalo Shop in Chicago. Her work at the Kalo Shop is undocumented with the exception of this single notebook. The notebook contains Bevis\u2019s graphite and ink sketches for metal jewelry, tableware, and accessories, with notations indicating materials used and, less frequently, client names.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Bevis,%20Mildred%20B.,%20Notebook%20of%20Designs%20for%20the%20Kalo%20Shop/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
