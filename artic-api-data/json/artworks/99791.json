    "description": "<p>The title of this collage originally derives from a two-line poem by Walt Whitman: \u201cThe untold want by life and land ne\u2019er granted,/ Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find\u201d (\u201cThe Untold Want\u201d [I87l), in Walt Whitman, <em>Complete Poetry and Collected Prose</em>, New York, 1982, p. 608). <em>Now Voyager</em> was also the name of a 1941 novel by Olive Higgins Prouty and of a 1942 movie, based on the novel, starring Bette Davis. The title\u2019s attraction for Cornell, given the voyage theme in so many of his works, is obvious. Here, though, the combination of title and image suggests a journey of a more interior kind, which is indeed evoked by Whitman\u2018s poem, and is a theme developed in both the novel and movie: these focus on the growth of the main protagonist, Charlotte Vale, from repressive childhood into mature adulthood. In Cornell\u2018s collage a child of uncertain gender is shown riding a merry-go-round horse, but the child\u2019s distant gaze and the planets above hint at an imagined voyage of much grander dimensions.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 91.</p>\n",
