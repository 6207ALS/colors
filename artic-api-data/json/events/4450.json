    "description": "<p>Join us for the 10th anniversary of the Modern Wing and hear from James Allan, executive director of planned giving and special gifts, as he recounts the short but fascinating history of the building and its collection.&nbsp;</p><p>The Modern Wing is the most recent addition to the museum as well as the greatest departure from original museum architecture. It utilizes key contemporary design principles, such as the use of natural lighting and a fa\u00e7ade of transparent, glazed walls that help meet the temperature and humidity conditions required for art while also surpassing Chicago Energy Code requirements. The most recent manifestation of our mission to show modern and contemporary art, the Modern Wing is the home of the <a href=\"/exhibitions/8964/the-new-contemporary\" target=\"_blank\">Edlis-Neeson Collection</a>, the largest donation in the museum\u2019s history.&nbsp;</p><p>For additional member programs, please visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"/events?audience=2\" target=\"_blank\">member programs calendar</a>.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a>&nbsp;or call (312) 499-4111 as far in advance as possible.&nbsp;</p>",
