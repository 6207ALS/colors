Harrison Collection, 1933.897\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Auguste Vacquerie was drawn in graphite on tan wove paper. The artist used fine graphite lines to establish the general form and define facial details but then developed the figure further with dark, dense lines, particularly in the hair and eyes, and broad areas of shading to create volume (fig. 1.1). Some areas capture the slight surface texture of the wove paper, most noticeably in the face. Touches of erasure were used to create highlights along the nose and the coat collar (fig. 1.2).\n\nCream, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nEven, appears short-fibered.\n\nSlightly irregular formation overall, with pulp clumps.\n\nAll edges of the sheet exhibit some degree of irregularity.\n\n284 \u00d7 176 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. There is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence under UV illumination that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nGraphite was used overall. The graphite appears quite soft, as it is dark in color, has high light reflectance in oblique illumination, and exhibits little surface deformation in the sheet. Dense graphite lines establish the general form and define facial details and hair. Light shading with the side of the graphite stick or pencil creates volume in the figure. Some broad areas of shading pick up the fine texture of the wove paper.\n\nTouches of erasure sharpen highlights in the face, particularly along the nose and coat collar (fig. 1.3).\n\nThere is no drawing on the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification. Some lines have been reinforced with a second stroke in the same graphite.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing was removed from a cream card mount, bordered with blue paper, as noted in the conservation report. All edges of the sheet are trimmed slightly irregularly. The paper appears to be discolored overall, although it is not possible to determine the original color. There is a slightly lighter band along the left edge that is approximately 10 mm wide.\n\nA few scuff marks are visible overall, particularly at the upper right near the figure\u2019s ear, at the lower center area, and across the center left side. There is light surface soiling and stray graphite medium around the perimeter of the sheet.\n\nThinned spots in the paper sheet appear overall; they are most visible along the left side on the verso when viewed in transmitted illumination. A few faint stains and small surface abrasions are visible.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D505 (ill.), and p. 144, cat. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on February 2, 1927, which were returned to him on March 14, 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial \u03bfbject file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.  \n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file. Finally, Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H. Harrison, \u201cA brief statement of where and how I acquired the various items in the collection of drawings I have given to the Art Institute . . . ,\u201d Oct. 18, 1934, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe gift arrived at the Art Institute on April 29, 1933, according to receipt of object 5463 and permanent receipt 5357, both dated Apr. 29, 1933, on file in Museum Registration, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAccording to Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 5, Suppl\u00e9ment aux peintures: Dessins; Pastels; Index (Wildenstein Institute, 1991), p. 148, cat. D505 (ill.); however, the published catalogue does not have a catalogue number 84.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">cat. 1 Caricature of Auguste Vacquerie, c. 1859.\n\nfig. 1.1 Detail of Caricature of Auguste Vacquerie (1859) showing the dark graphite lines used to define the eyes.
