    "description": "<p>This unbuilt competition entry for an observation tower in Busan, Korea, combines several avenues of theoretical inquiry central to the work of the Los Angeles\u2013based architecture practice Patterns. In order to express a \u201cvitalist and frenetic idea of movement,\u201d the architects chose to move away from symmetry and the vertical segregation of different programs in multiuse towers. Instead, a looser, \u201cincessant\u201d affiliation of spaces and circulation promotes activity in sequential, yet singular events. The design of the tower was also determined by aerodynamics, resulting in long bunching and braiding volumes and vertical apertures to create a flowing space on the interior and wind \u201cturbulence\u201d on the facade.</p>\n",
