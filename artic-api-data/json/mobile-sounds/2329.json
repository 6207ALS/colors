    "transcript": "<p>ALLISON PERELMAN: About five years after he had made the Noa Noa Suite of woodblock prints, Gauguin revisited to this technique, but with a new spin. He was back in Tahiti at this point, without access to the same quality of materials that he had in Paris. So once again, he had to be inventive.</p>\n<p>HARRIET STRATIS: So upon his return to Tahiti, you can imagine that on that island Gauguin\u2019s choices of art-making materials were extremely limited. There were no art supply stores, and he had limited resources financially. He had to be much more ingenious in finding ways to create the woodblocks and to print them. He went into the forests. He salvaged wood that had been discarded. If you look down at the block below the print, you\u2019ll see that it is not as uniform block like the ones he used to print Noa Noa. Here he had to develop innovative way of cutting the blocks that he had found. When you look closely at \u201cWayside Shrine in Brittany,\u201d you\u2019ll see a series of vertical lines at the edges of the impression. As your eye follows the frieze from left to right, you will see these lines reappear in the frieze in the center of the grouping. These lines indicate that Gauguin used the same piece of wood that he cut in half and into smaller sections to carve the two related images. To learn more about how Gauguin cut down indigenous wood to form it into block for printing, please see the digital label in this gallery.</p>\n",
