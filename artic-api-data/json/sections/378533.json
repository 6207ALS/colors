The hotel, which opened in August 1889, was one of London\u2019s finest. The Whistlers occupied one of the upper suites above the Victoria Embankment, and their balconied windows looked out to sweeping views of the Thames. During the weeks of their stay at the Savoy, Whistler divided his time between painting in a succession of temporary studios and working on transfer drawings at the hotel as he stayed near Beatrix\u2019s bedside. The Ways saw him often during that period; the Savoy Hotel was not far from their offices on Wellington Street, and that proximity may have encouraged the artist to focus on lithography during this painful time. T. R. Way (1912) wrote perceptively: \u201cThe gathering tension due to Mrs. Whistler\u2019s increasing illness seemed to brace him up to a point of keenness in his lithographic work that enabled him to make a group of drawings, which, I think, form the climax of his black and white work.\u201d\n\nAs Way recorded in the same passage, Whistler drew a total of eight lithographic subjects at the Savoy Hotel. Six are views of the Thames \u201ccomprising the whole outlook, right, left, and opposite\u201d (cat. 154, cat. 155, cat. 156, cat. 157, cat. 158, and cat. 161). The other two are portraits of Beatrix Whistler (cat. 159 and cat. 160). Savoy Pigeons was certainly among the artist\u2019s first two Savoy transfer drawings, which were processed and printed by the Ways on March 10. On the following day, Whistler sent three impressions each of Savoy Pigeons and Evening, Little Waterloo Bridge (cat. 155) to Wunderlich\u2019s in New York. Whistler described them as \u201cjust out of the oven\u201d in a letter written to Edward Kennedy on March 14.\n\nSavoy Pigeons takes its title from the two birds perched on the metal railing of the Whistlers\u2019 balcony. The view is toward Westminster with Lambeth Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and Westminster Bridge in the background. In the middle distance, barges pass beneath Charing Cross Railway Bridge as steam rises from trains traversing the river. This lithograph and Waterloo Bridge (cat. 156) were the only two Savoy transfer drawings in which the artist refrained from using the stump. The finest lifetime proofs of Savoy Pigeons are notable for the clarity of the lightest lines as well as delicate tonal gradations.\n\nThere is no primary documentation surrounding the publication of Savoy Pigeons in The Studio in June 1896, apart from Way\u2019s (1912) comment that the image was \u201cquite well known\u201d as a result.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (288 \u00d7 228 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (300 \u00d7 183 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (2), cream laid paper (302 \u00d7 180 mm); cream laid paper (301 \u00d7 179 mm). London: BM, cream laid paper (274 \u00d7 214 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (300 \u00d7 180 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (288 \u00d7 228 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Brooklyn, TBM; and New York, MMA (2).\n\nPublished edition. Savoy Pigeons was machine printed from supplementary stones and appeared in the June 1896 issue of The Studio. Many impressions have been taken from copies of the periodical and trimmed to remove The Studio\u2019s blind stamp. Nevertheless, the periodical\u2019s cream laid paper, which often darkens to tan, is easily distinguished from papers used by the Ways for their hand-printed impressions. As was typically the case with large editions printed by machine from secondary stones, there were considerable losses in the lightest areas of the drawing, especially in the sky, in the distant buildings, and in the delicate shadows under the bridges. The periodical edition was printed in a heavy black ink that tends to exaggerate the contrast between foreground and distance.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (294 \u00d7 205 mm), with blind stamp, rebound; cream laid paper (295 \u00d7 207 mm), with blind stamp.

(1980), p. lxviii. However, we know from the artist\u2019s correspondence with Marcus Huish that they were still at De Vere House on 31 January 1896, and that they had moved to the Savoy by February 16; Whistler to Huish, GUL F271, LB3/7.
