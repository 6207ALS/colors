Barr in 1951 for the Museum of Modern Art in New York. For the Art Institute, the acquisition was a bold but protracted one as it necessitated the exchange of a painting in the collection, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec\u2019s The Opera Messalina at Bordeaux (1900\u20131901; Pearlman Foundation). In addition, Henri Matisse\u2019s large-scale canvas\u2014despite its inclusion in the retrospective\u2014was somewhat of a curiosity: it was not publically exhibited until 1926 and had been shown only a handful of times since, and its black-and-white reproduction appeared in just a few English-language publications before the acquisition. To complicate matters, the seemingly austere and obdurate surface was enhanced by damage\u2014some of it likely caused when it was rolled by the artist, possibly even before its completion. More recently, a broken piece of wood in its traveling crate during the 1952 exhibition tour had caused a tear in the lower portion of the painting.\n\nDespite these issues, when legendary Art Institute director Daniel Catton Rich acquired Bathers, he wrote to Matisse in Nice to communicate the good news. According to Rich\u2019s colleague Katharine Kuh, the first curator of modern art at the museum, the artist\u2019s reply came by telegram, congratulating the director and stating that he considered the painting \u201cone of his five key . . . no, pivotal works.\u201d While Matisse\u2019s appraisal has often been recounted in subsequent years, the true place of the picture in the artist\u2019s oeuvre and its just characterization as pivotal were not fully appreciated until recently.\n\nTo understand the critical role of Bathers by a River, we must acknowledge the historical context in which Matisse conceived his work. Bather compositions were related to the theme of the Golden Age, a topic the artist first began to explore around 1900. For Matisse and his peers, the concept of Arcadia was embodied by the South of France, where he traveled to paint in the early 1900s and which provided artistic inspiration for his first major paintings: Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9 (1904\u201305; fig. 25.1), its title taken from Charles Baudelaire\u2019s poem of pastoral idyll \u201cL\u2019invitation au voyage\u201d; and Le bonheur de vivre (1905\u201306; Barnes Foundation, Philadephia), which he referred to, at least while it was underway, as \u201cArcadia.\u201d In exploring the theme of the bathers, Matisse looked to Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2014he owned a number of works by the artist, most importantly his Three Bathers of 1879\u201382 (Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais)\u2014but also to Nicolas Poussin, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and other classical and classically inspired artists whom he admired. At the same time, Matisse\u2019s interpretation drew upon the colonialist and romanticized figure of the \u201cnoble savage,\u201d whose mythology had grown over the nineteenth century. He was emboldened by the example of Paul Gauguin, who died in 1903, but whose work Matisse knew well through his relationship with Gauguin\u2019s friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid. Monfreid owned a number of paintings and sculptures by the deceased artist and was preparing a major German exhibition of his work in the summer of 1905. Indeed, Matisse\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin was so intimate that Gustave Fayet invited him to make a new edition of the Noa Noa Suite of wood-block prints, Gauguin\u2019s ode to an unspoiled Arcadia located in Tahiti. Matisse would reference both primitivist and classical visions of Arcadia in his own work\u2014his Blue Nude (Memory of Biskra) (1907; fig. 25.2) is an example of the former and Le luxe (I) (summer 1907; fig. 25.3) and Le luxe (II) (summer\u2013fall 1907; Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen) of the latter.\n\nFollowing Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9 and Le bonheur de vivre, Matisse began to excerpt smaller groups of bathers from his compositions and repaint them \u00e0 la C\u00e9zanne; this repetitive practice served his goal of paring down forms to their purest and most meaningful state, or what he called in \u201cNotes of a Painter\u201d (1908) \u201ca truer, more essential character.\u201d It was, however, with his large-scale Bathers with a Turtle (1908; fig. 25.4) that the artist found a new direction. While he had earlier employed the figures of Bathers with a Turtle in Three Bathers (summer 1907; Minneapolis Institute of Art) and again in the two Le luxe compositions, in this painting he removed their narrative beach or Golden Age context, respectively, and made their poses more ambiguous (the one standing with her hand in her mouth, for instance, earlier stood in profile with a towel at her side). In so doing, he removed any assurance of their peaceful existence. He also made repeated revisions on the same canvas instead of starting a new one on the theme.\n\nMatisse\u2019s greatest early patron, Sergei Shchukin, admired the work during a visit to the artist\u2019s Paris studio. Disappointed that it was promised to the German collector Karl-Ernst Osthaus, Shchukin asked the artist to make him a similar canvas. Matisse called the resulting work \u201cBathers\u201d; however, it is known today as Game of Bowls (1908; fig. 25.5). While the composition is smaller in scale than Bathers with a Turtle, Matisse repeated and recombined the figural poses of the earlier painting. Calling the canvas an esquisse, he tantalized the collector with the possibility of a grander project to come. Indeed, it would be instrumental in his acquisition of a major commission from Shchukin the following year\u2014for the monumental Dance (II) (summer\u2013fall 1910; fig. 25.6) and Music (1910; fig. 25.7)\u2014and still more critical for this discussion, the inception of Bathers by a River.\n\nThe early history of Matisse\u2019s Bathers by a River is directly connected to Shchukin\u2019s 1909 commission of decorative panels for the staircase of his Moscow home. Indeed, research shows that a composition devoted to the theme of bathers was central to the artist\u2019s original scheme. Planning for the project began in early winter 1909 if not before, and by the end of February, Shchukin had visited the artist in his Couvent du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur atelier in Paris. Before the meeting\u2014whether to introduce the idea to the collector or to begin to explore it for himself\u2014Matisse stretched a canvas larger than any he had yet painted and started to lay in the outlines of a composition that he would later call Dance (Esquisse) but is known today as Dance (I) (1909; fig. 25.8). According to Matisse\u2019s recollection of this February meeting, after the studio visit he and Shchukin discussed the commission at the restaurant Larue. Archival records make it clear that an order for decorative panels was firmly in place by the time he left, although the exact subjects and number of panels would be a matter of discussion for weeks to come. On March 6, Shchukin wrote for more information about the work: \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking a great deal of the large painting. Perhaps you could send a sketch [croquis] in color. It seems to me that it will be very beautiful! and that I must take it. In any case, I trust you and I am sure that the large painting will be a beautiful d\u00e9coration for my staircase.\u201d A week later, the artist reported back that the \u201cgrand tableau\u201d Shchukin saw in Paris was now fully underway: \u201cThis means that the canvas that you saw without color [blanche] is finished and will remain the esquisse of the painting I\u2019m about to undertake. I\u2019m very happy with it and that is why I\u2019m using a new canvas to execute this painting. . . . Many people greatly like the esquisse (of 4 m) and I\u2019ve had two offers to sell it; but I want to keep it for myself.\u201d Along with the letter, Matisse apparently sent a drawing of the work, which he probably traced from a photograph of the painting taken by Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The artist asked to confirm the number of works for Shchukin\u2019s home and suggested two or three subjects that would result in a feeling of absolute repose. In reference to the second subject, he wrote, \u201cI made you a color sketch [croquis] indicating my idea for the second part to give you an idea of the atmosphere that could be created by the decorative ensemble of your staircase.\u201d The following day, Matisse sent along two watercolors of the panels, which he annotated Composition No. I (c. 1909; State Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow) and Composition No. II (c. 1909; fig. 25.9), and it is in the latter that we find the first image of the design that eventually became Bathers by a River. The work presents five women relaxing near a waterfall nestled within a verdant, hilly landscape. Two bathe in the water, which Matisse described in blue with pink highlights as he did in Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9 and Le bonheur de vivre. Ink lines that the artist sketched but later abandoned trace his working thoughts for the figures, whose poses recall those he used in earlier works. For example, the standing woman at left echoes the one with flowers on the same side of Le bonheur de vivre; her crouching companion is similar to those in a painting made in the summer of 1907, Music (Esquisse) (Museum of Modern Art, New York), as well as in Game of Bowls and in Bathers with a Turtle. To the right of the waterfall, the standing woman with an outstretched arm mimics one who lifts her hair in Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9, and the reclining bather at right is related to a number of figures in Le bonheur de vivre as well as to the nymph in the Nymph and Faun of c. 1911 (fig. 25.10). The figure standing in the water is similar to one in C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Three Bathers, although the orientation is reversed.\n\nThe artist\u2019s watercolors arrived at Shchukin\u2019s home around March 16, and the collector immediately replied that while they were \u201cvery beautiful and very noble in color and in line,\u201d\n\nI cannot at present put a nude in my staircase. After the death of a relative, I took three little girls (8, 9, and 10 years old) into my household, and here in Russia . . . one simply cannot display nudes to little girls. Do the same ronde but with the young women in dresses. The same with composition no. 2. The staircase has two walls for the panels. . . . If I had no little girls in my house, I would have risked defying public opinion, but for now I have to respect Russian customs. Perhaps you will find a way of creating the same dance, but with girls in dresses? . . . I hope you will find a way of decorating my staircase with two large panels (of 4 meters) but without the nudes.\n\nIt is important to note that Shchukin did not reject either of the subjects that Matisse proposed, and probably around March 23, the artist responded to his patron\u2019s requested revisions on the reverse of one of Shchukin\u2019s unrelated letters. On this page (fig. 25.11), he redrafted the composition of the bathers, dressing the two flanking figures in loose drapery, turning the woman in the stream away from the viewer, and reducing the total number of figures from five to four. We can infer from Shchukin\u2019s next letter, dated March 27, that Matisse sent a sketch of this revised composition, although this letter has been lost to time. In his response, Shchukin stated clearly, \u201cFor my staircase I need only two decorative panels. Only I wish to avoid nudes as a subject.\u201d However, he offered Matisse the opportunity to make the picture in a different format and for a more private area of his home. The next day, however, he telegraphed the artist: \u201cCancel all reservations expressed in my letters request you give me priority for two panels on staircase\u2014telegraph if accept firm order panel La danse for fifteen thousand\u2014for second panel please do music as subject\u2014write with price second panel.\u201d That even near the end of the month the pair had not decisively agreed upon the panels\u2019 subjects is important in the genesis of Bathers by a River.\n\nOn March 25\u2014after Matisse\u2019s revised proposal but probably before Shchukin\u2019s response\u2014the Salon des Ind\u00e9pendants opened. It was likely on this occasion that Charles Estienne interviewed Matisse for Les nouvelles as part of a series on modern art. In explaining his work, the artist proudly mentioned a commission \u201cto decorate a staircase\u201d and the three subjects of dance, music, and repose (the bathing scene), which strongly suggests that he had not yet received Shchukin\u2019s most recent letter and telegram or that he hoped to persuade his patron to follow his plan:\n\nIt has three floors. I imagine a visitor coming in from the outside. There is the first floor. One must summon up energy, give a feeling of lightness. My first panel represents the dance, that whirling round on top of the hill. On the second floor one is now within the house; in its silence I see a scene of music with engrossed participants; finally, the third floor is completely calm and I paint a scene of repose: some people reclining on the grass, chatting or daydreaming.\n\nOn March 31, perceiving silence on Matisse\u2019s part, Shchukin wrote apologetically:\n\nI find such nobility in your panel Dance that I have decided to ignore our bourgeois opinion and put a subject with nudes in my staircase. At the same time I shall need a second panel, where Music would be a good theme. I was very happy to have your response: firmly accept orders for dance panel fifteen thousand and music panel twelve thousand confidential price. I thank you very much and hope to have an esquisse of the second panel soon. In my house there is a great deal of music making (Bach, Beethoven, Mozart). The music panel should to some extent express the character of the house. I trust you completely, and am convinced that Music will be as successful as Dance. I ask you please to give me news of your work. All my reservations in the two preceding letters are canceled by my telegram last Sunday. Now you have my definitive order for the two panels.\n\nBut while Matisse had envisioned panels on dance and music for Shchukin\u2019s staircase, he had also by this time become firmly committed to a bathers composition. Indeed, he responded on April 9, \u201c[I] agree to the dance and music panels. At this moment, I am working on the composition for the panel of esquisse no. 2, you have in your hands the idea for it. I started it before your letter. Thus, I will finish it and then begin the composition of Music.\u201d A photograph (fig. 25.12) documents this early stage of the canvas. In it, the artist sits in quarter profile, dressed in a smock and with a palette and brushes in hand; behind him, and looming large on the stretched canvas, is a loosely painted sketch for the bathers composition. At left we can see the ends of feet and the dynamic contours of a standing figure who turns her back to us; she swings one arm up and around her head, like the nymph in the left section of a ceramic triptych that Matisse made for Osthaus in 1907 (fig. 25.13). Directly behind the artist\u2019s left shoulder is a second figure, her head in profile and her face somewhat similar to that of the standing bather in the Le luxe compositions. This bather assumes a crouching pose, her bent legs visible behind Matisse\u2019s elbow. At the edge of the knee, we also can make out sweeping lines that define the water\u2019s edge. While the author of the photograph is unknown, we should consider the possibility that it was taken at the time of Estienne\u2019s interview, perhaps for publication. Like other documents, it makes clear that Bathers by a River was not only part of Matisse\u2019s original concept for the Shchukin commission, but also that it was initiated well before the paintings that would finally be installed on his staircase\u2014Dance (II) and Music\u2014which the artist would not begin until the fall. Indeed, we can be certain that it was painted soon after Dance (I), and the nearness of their dimensions corroborates this.\n\nAn X-ray of Bathers by a River (fig. 25.14) reveals much about the early stages of the composition. Matisse\u2019s subsequent adjustments and alterations have occluded some details, but on the left we can make out a standing bather bending with a raised arm and turned from the viewer. Her pose is reminiscent of the Osthaus ceramic as well as a drawing for Matisse\u2019s contemporaneous sculptural project (1907\u201309; private collection, Switzerland), the bas-relief Back. A second woman crouches in profile by the edge of the waterfall, while another is immersed in the stream, her back to the viewer; these figures look much like those in the previous Bathers by a River sketches. A fourth bather stands at right, lifting her arm over her downturned head and possibly holding a towel; the position of her head echoes that of the standing figure in Game of Bowls, and her torso and arms recall Nude with a White Scarf (1909; fig. 25.15). Microscopic examination and cross-sectional analysis of specific locations have determined the original painting\u2019s palette, which was remarkably similar in color to the watercolor Matisse sent to Shchukin on March 12. The foliage was light green (see fig. 25.16), and the sky at the very top was a deep blue (see fig. 25.17). Matisse painted the waterfall pink and turquoise (see fig. 25.18), and the riverbed was tan (see fig. 25.19). He modeled the figures in a warm pink (see fig. 25.20). Immersed in water, the third bather is distinguished from the others by her golden hair (see fig. 25.21), much like her counterparts in the preceding Le luxe and Bathers with a Turtle compositions. Departing from the watercolor, Matisse added a snake, which he initially painted yellow (see fig. 25.22), fairly early in his creation of the painting. Freed from his patron\u2019s demands, Matisse continued to work on the large composition, although likely keeping in mind the need to move it to a new studio by the summer. He completed his first stage of work in time to roll and transport the canvas from Paris in June but continued to think about the project even while he was away from the painting itself. During the summer of 1909, Matisse and his family traveled to Cavali\u00e8re-sur-Mer, in the South of France, where he made drawings and paintings (see cat. 16) in preparation for his commission. By going to the Midi, he made clear his intention to locate Shchukin\u2019s entire decorative program (Dance and Music, as well as the rejected Bathers) within this pastoral paradise and to satisfy the contemporary taste for d\u00e9coration. Furthermore, the artist identified the palettes of these works\u2014like that of the esquisse for Dance\u2014with the sun, sea, and pines of the region. In fact, when he shared his summer paintings with his friends, the artist Georgette Agutte and her husband, Socialist politician and writer Marcel Sembat, back in Paris, he explained, \u201cI wanted to convey my total impression of the Midi.\u201d\n\nBy September 1909 Matisse had left Cavali\u00e8re and settled into his new home in Issy-les-Moulineaux, in the southwest suburbs of Paris. With funds from Shchukin, and on the recommendation of photographer Edward Steichen, he had purchased and installed a prefabricated studio on the northwest corner of the grounds. This building was approximately 33 square feet and, unlike the Couvent du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur atelier in Paris, provided the artist with ample space for making paintings and sculptures in the same location. Its interior was faced with beadboard and punctuated with light from a double-paned window on the south, a long set of windows on the north, and a pitched roof whose northern portion was glazed.\n\nIt was here that Matisse unrolled and restretched Dance (I) as we can see in Steichen\u2019s fall 1909 photograph of the artist at work on a new canvas (fig. 25.23), Still Life with \u201cDance\u201d (1909; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). In the right background of both the photograph and painting, we can make out a large painting on what appears to be an eight-member stretcher. This may well be Bathers by a River: its location against the west wall corresponds to Pierre Matisse\u2019s recollections, and it is likely that the artist would have placed it in this area of the studio in order to take advantage of the daylight from the northern windows. While no known photographs exist that date work on the painting between fall 1909 and 1913, a 1909 watercolor made by one of Matisse\u2019s sons, replete with spring flowers in the foreground, suggests the presence of the canvas in the new studio and the indicates the likelihood of the artist\u2019s ongoing attention to it. Technical examination and physical evidence strongly support the idea that he indeed continued to work on it during his first year in the new studio, doing so in concert with, and in response to, the panels for Shchukin.\n\nSoon after Matisse\u2019s return to Paris in the fall, he received a letter from his patron thanking him for news of his summer preparations and mentioning that he hoped to come to the city for the upcoming Salon d\u2019Automne. \u201cMy d\u00e9corations \u2018Dance\u2019 and \u2018Music,\u2019\u201d Shchukin wrote, \u201cinterest me very much. I am sure that this will be a big victory.\u201d The collector\u2019s expectations were clearly high, as were the artist\u2019s, and by September 27, Matisse had started on the commissioned panels. Back in March, he had told his patron that he would use the esquisse (Dance [I]) and \u201ca new canvas to execute this painting.\u201d Now the artist set to work transferring the composition, although the exact method he used cannot be determined at this time. A photograph taken by Henri Manuel, who visited Matisse in the fall, shows him at work on a composition that is either Dance (I) or an early version of the new canvas, known today as Dance (II), looking very much like the earlier esquisse (fig. 25.24).\n\nWork on Music would prove a more demanding process. As far as we know, Matisse did not produce a compositional drawing or esquisse for the panel. Instead, he may have started from his 1907 painting Music (Esquisse), which depicts a standing violinist and seated figure in a similarly generalized landscape, and worked on specific figures in Cavali\u00e8re-sur-Mer. The first record of Matisse\u2019s work on a canvas can be found in a fascinating photograph taken by Druet, likely dating from November 1909 (fig. 25.25). It shows us the artist\u2019s earliest thoughts about the composition of Music. There are four male musicians atop a rolling hill: the one on the left plays a flute, the next blows a double-pipe, and two, along with one woman, open their mouths in song. The photograph was taken at the beginning of the \u00e9bauche stage, with the figures starting to be distinguished by heavy patches of shading laid in behind them. Compared to the figures in Dance (I), the musicians are far weightier and more solid, each nestled into the surrounding earth.\n\nAnother photograph of Music taken by Druet (fig. 25.26) probably dates from some time in the early spring of 1910. Here we see that Matisse adjusted the composition, moving the flutist and the two singers in the upper half of the canvas up and to the right; he has also made their poses tenser and more rigid. In striking ways, he advanced Music beyond Dance (II): we see narrative details (flowers, plant forms, and a sleeping dog) that are altogether absent in the companion panel, as well as a roughened, \u201cprimitivizing\u201d description of the figures that is reminiscent of contemporaneous Expressionist prints and paintings of the Br\u00fccke group in Germany. Druet\u2019s photograph also verifies that many compositional adjustments had already taken place by this stage. It is worth noting, too, the many parallels between the states of Music and Bathers by a River (see fig. 25.27), suggesting that the bathers composition was still in process at this time.\n\nAt the end of March, Agutte, who with Sembat had purchased one of the Cavali\u00e8re paintings, visited Matisse\u2019s studio and saw Music, probably in a state close to what Druet recorded in his second photograph. Her thoughts, written to the artist while he was on break in Collioure, deserve note as a record of the progress of his work:\n\nI went to your place in Clamart Wednesday . . . I was able to see the beautiful third esquisse, of musicians. I like it very much, the sitting figure who is playing two flutes I think and who is seated in the middle and is the most ambitious, seems to me superb in its line and I like the intensity of the flesh tones, but will that not force you to stress the intensity of the flesh tones of the dancers if the panels are placed side by side? I nevertheless would regret to see the range [of color] in the first large esquisse transformed, it is so beautiful as it is. The whole of this third panel is very beautiful, I am certain that Marcel will be very taken with it.\n\nHis friend touched on what would become a growing problem for Matisse with Dance (II) and Music, namely how to keep the compositions and their intensity of color, form, energy, and mood such that they would satisfy both the expectations of d\u00e9coration and his own desire for expression.\n\nAn X-ray of Bathers by a River with its upper, later paint layers suppressed (fig. 25.28) shows some of Matisse\u2019s reworkings on the canvas. However, his subsequent alterations\u2014scraping down abandoned forms in certain areas and covering some with lead white\u2014make it difficult to interpret with current technology, and we are only able to definitively date a small constellation of changes to 1909\u201310. There is evidence that Matisse repositioned the figure to the left of the stream, raising her a little above the midpoint of the canvas. He altered the pose from the previous side-turned crouch, turning the bather toward the viewer but keeping the legs bent and head facing down toward the running water. The posture is similar to that in a drawing that he made of Loulou Brouty while in Cavali\u00e8re-sur-Mer (see cat. 16) and provides evidence of his continued thinking about this picture during the summer of 1909. The artist shifted the position of the figure on the right side of the waterfall too, lifting her head and straightening her back while keeping her immersed in the water. He adjusted the pose of the fourth figure as well, although the exact nature of the changes are difficult to extract from the tangle of revisions visible in the X-ray. It is certain, however, that Matisse tightened the pose and strengthened the limbs in response to the stiffer, more powerfully built figures of Dance (II). A detail from the X-ray of the fourth bather\u2019s left arm shows a similar articulation of muscle. Cross sections of specific locations on the left arms of the fourth and second figures (fig. 25.29) reveal a corresponding change in palette: Matisse altered the flesh tones of the bathers, making them more intense. He also modified the hair of the third figure (see fig. 25.30)\u2014although still yellow, it became a comparatively lighter shade\u2014and shifted the foliage and background to a darker, richer green (see fig. 25.31). It is important to note that despite these color changes, physical examination of Bathers has not confirmed that Matisse transformed the palette to the degree he did that of the completed Dance (II) and Music panels. However, some elements, visible on the painting\u2019s surface in raking light, correspond to a second stage in Music\u2019s evolution documented by Druet. For instance, near the middle left, Matisse revised the second bather\u2019s right foot (see fig. 25.32) in a similar, thickly outlined style that gives it a heavier effect than the figures\u2019 feet in Dance (I). While we cannot fully document Matisse\u2019s progress on Bathers by a River during this period of the painting\u2019s evolution, these correspondences suggest that he may have finished in early spring 1910, before Agutte visited his studio on March 31 and subsequently worried to Matisse about the intense colors in which he had repainted Music. Perhaps the artist planned to continue Bathers by a River after completing Shchukin\u2019s panels, but by the end of May they were not yet finished, and he confided to his old friend and fellow artist Jean Biette that it had been \u201can immense effort, which has exhausted me, so much so that I\u2019m feeling a bit drained and could use a month\u2019s rest, which I can\u2019t take.\u201d\n\nStill, he felt confident enough in the composition to send Druet\u2019s now outdated photograph to Shchukin at the end of May, noting that the composition was still changing:\n\nIt is a pity that you cannot see the harmony of color, which is very complete and will surely be to your taste. Several days ago I abandoned the panel in order to attack Dance. . . . After this panel I shall, of course, take up Music again . . . I think you will be completely satisfied . . . this work occupied me much of this winter and will take me almost all the summer.\n\nWork on Dance (II) proceeded quickly. In a matter of weeks, Matisse had begun to transform the palette of the canvas from that of the esquisse to something in line with Music, and he soon moved to even more intense shades of red, blue, and green. Matisse would continue to work on the panels until their presentation at the 1910 Salon d\u2019Automne, where they met with much negative response from critics and\u2014initially at least\u2014Shchukin. The otherwise committed patron hesitated in his acceptance of them, considering first\u2014at the urging of Matisse\u2019s own dealer, Bernheim-Jeune\u2014a d\u00e9coration by Puvis de Chavannes that they presented in the artist\u2019s studio after he departed for Spain on November 16. En route back to Moscow, Shchukin regretted his hesitation and upon his return sent a full apology to Matisse, even requesting new paintings, but it would take some time for him to come to appreciate the true importance of the panels. Given Bathers by a River\u2019s relationship with this commission and that its recent reworkings were connected to the other panels, it is not unreasonable to assume that Matisse left Issy without resuming work on the canvas. In fact, it was likely a full three years before he felt the freedom to return to his abandoned bathers painting.\n\nBy early March 1913, Matisse had returned home to Issy from the second of two trips to Tangier. On March 17, F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on wrote to the artist, offering him a show of his Moroccan work at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, which he accepted. In anticipation of the exhibition, Sembat wrote an enthusiastic article for Cahiers d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui in which he attempted to bring renewed attention to Matisse after his time away and counter the persistent negative assessment of his work that had followed the debut of Dance (II) and Music at the 1910 Salon d\u2019Automne. In his appraisal, Sembat singled out the recently completed Moroccan Caf\u00e9 (1913; fig. 25.33) for its process\u2014the physical sign that Matisse had moved \u201cby instinct from the concrete to the abstract\u201d:\n\nThose sprawling figures, all in the same nuance of gray, such a restful gray, and whose faces are represented by an ocher-yellow oval, the fellow on the left, that\u2019s how he was painted. Look! Up there that fellow on the left\u2014he was red! The other one, next to him\u2014he was blue, and the other was yellow. The faces had features\u2014eyes, a mouth . . . By examining the bottom of the painting, you discover traces of what used to be a row of Turkish-style slippers . . . Why . . . has all that melted away? Because, for Matisse, to perfect one\u2019s self is to simplify!\n\nThe article did much to restore Matisse\u2019s critical reception and self-confidence. It was around this same time that he returned to Bathers by a River, simplifying and changing the composition in a similar way. The artist may even have resumed work on the canvas directly after completing Moroccan Caf\u00e9, if he indeed finished the latter painting in Issy.\n\nOn May 13, through the introduction of Gertrude Stein, the American photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn visited Matisse in his studio, where he made a number of portraits of the artist alone and one with Am\u00e9lie for his forthcoming publication Men of Mark (fig. 25.34 and fig. 25.35). The majority of these images present Matisse armed with a large palette and brushes standing on a ladder, sometimes while painting the monumental scene. The photographs serve as a record of his working practice and process of revision: by correcting distortions and digitally stitching together the glimpses of the painting that the prints provide, we can reconstruct the state of Bathers by a River on the date of the photographer\u2019s visit (fig. 25.36). Looking past the distorted silhouettes of the artist that result from the digital reconstruction, we can see a canvas that is clearly in transition and that demonstrates the degree to which Matisse\u2019s Moroccan experience had influenced his work. For instance, the standing figure at left is stiffly posed and floats against a dark background that recalls the composition of Fatma, the Mulatto Woman (1912; fig. 25.37). We can discern part of the bather\u2019s earlier posture\u2014perhaps one that Matisse painted between 1910 and 1913\u2014by looking at the area of the back, where a broad, sweeping arc runs from the left shoulder to right buttock, indicating her forward-facing pose. The artist transformed this once-graceful stance into a more rigid, upright one by blocking out the pink flesh of earlier limbs and musculature with dark-gray, wedge-shaped forms; this was much like the carving that he used to transition his bas-relief Back (fig. 25.38 and fig. 25.39) between about 1911 and the spring of 1913. This exaggerated modeling suggests the dramatic highlights and shadows that he witnessed in the light of Morocco, and his heavy brushwork echoes the hatched shading he employed on the body of the left figure of the Moroccan-period sheet Face and Two Nudes with Gourds (1912\u201313; Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris) as well as the right one in Backs and Scene of Tangier (1912/13; private collection). It appears that Matisse executed a different type of blocking in at the top of the canvas in preparation for the same bather\u2019s head: a pale-turquoise, half-oval shape covers the green background (fig. 25.40), while the earlier head, slightly lower and to the right, was scraped away from a large circular area that is visible in the X-ray. The abstraction and pale color anticipate the kinds of forms the artist would devise for the figures in his final version of the great canvas The Moroccans (1915/16; Museum of Modern Art, New York).\n\nMany of Matisse\u2019s adjustments are contained within groups of vertical lines. They establish the construction of the standing figure at left, where they appear near the upper part of the torso and run from the shoulders to the heels on both sides of the body. The artist used a similar framework for the next bather, who remained in generally the same position as before, but with a new right leg and foot and adjustments to the arms and left leg and foot. Near the left leg, we can see a number of intersecting lines that he used to reposition and then build out the limb. He also painted vertical lines near the back, at the top of the head, and adjacent to the left arm; forming a kind of network, these helped him set the figure into the space of the composition, a practice he may have begun in such Moroccan paintings as The Standing Riffian (1912; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg).\n\nMatisse made most of these changes within the color palette established in the previous stages of the composition; for example, he painted new adjustments to the bathers\u2019 bodies\u2014including the right leg and foot of the second bather\u2014in a pink similar to the one he had used for flesh (see fig. 25.41) in the 1909 and 1910 states of the painting. But he also executed dramatic revisions of forms in colors not yet seen on the canvas. For instance, he chose a dark gray to cut into and build the new torso and legs for the first bather. Similarly, he employed new colors to establish a fresh pose for the third figure, which is in an early stage of transition in Coburn\u2019s photographs. Here the artist retained the torso but moved the legs and feet to a standing position outside the waterfall in an arrangement that recalls the middle figure in Backs and Scene of Tangier. To build the limbs, Matisse covered the earlier pink and turquoise waterfall and tan riverbank with black and then sketched new legs and feet with pale pink paint (see fig. 25.42). This approach recalls the impression of a black-ink monotype printed on pale paper, a technique the artist would soon begin to explore (see cats. 21\u201322). Throughout the digitally reconstructed painting, we can find examples of the reverse of this process, in which Matisse painted dark, hatched outlines around light-colored forms. The artist made use of this methodology for the second figure\u2019s left arm and right foot; it was another means to build volume on the otherwise flat and increasingly worked canvas.\n\nUnfortunately, the composite image does not include much information about the bather on the right. It may be that Coburn preferred the left side of the canvas, that Matisse chose it because the right side was not as advanced, or simply that the lighting in the Issy studio was uneven. Regardless, this reconstruction gives us the sense that the artist may have approached different parts of the painting in distinct ways; he painted a vertical line to separate the first bather from the next two, recalling the diptych and triptych compositions he produced during his two trips to Morocco. The backgrounds of these areas appear different in the reconstruction: the left side is painted in various shades of gray and green, while the central portion is made up of passages of light grays and greens, much like those in Fatma. Whatever his reason for partitioning the canvas, by June 16, Matisse had received proofs of the photographs from Coburn and replied that he found them \u201ccompletely rare.\u201d They must have proven to be intriguing counterpoints over the next few months and into the fall as he continued to work on the canvas and watched as forms, in Sembat\u2019s words, \u201cmelted away\u201d into others.\n\nJust four months later Matisse wrote to his friend, the artist Charles Camoin:\n\nI have been wanting to write to you for a long time. But I am preoccupied by my work . . . When I have a moment, the ideas don\u2019t come to me\u2014you know this ailment. At present I am tired and what I need would be to chase all concerns from my mind. Still I have worked on only a few things this summer, but I have advanced my large painting of the Bathers, the Portrait of my Wife, as well as my Bas-Relief\n\nMatisse\u2019s assessment was, of course, an understatement; the transformation of Bathers by a River alone had proved to be a major effort that would demand equal measures of physical and mental endurance to continue. Over the summer, he was preoccupied with a number of artistic and personal concerns; he had, for instance, been spending much time with Pablo Picasso, who was convalescing after \u201ca little typhoid,\u201d as his companion Eva Gouel explained to Gertrude Stein. Matisse visited his recuperating friend on several occasions in July and August, and in September reported on their activities: \u201cPicasso is an equestrian and we ride together, which astonishes many people! Why? Painting goes slowly but well.\u201d Although the pair\u2019s conversations went undocumented, we can assume they touched on art. To a degree, this may account for Matisse\u2019s sustained examination of his subjects in reduced, nearly monochromatic palettes reminiscent of the Analytical Cubist paintings of Picasso and Georges Braque in 1909 and 1910\u2014the blues and, increasingly, grays of The Blue Window (1913; fig. 25.43), Flowers and Ceramic Plate (1913; St\u00e4del Museum, Frankfurt am Main), and Portrait of Madame Matisse (July\u2013Oct. 1914; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg). In addition, earlier in the summer he was working on behalf of the Galerie Levesque, offering\u2014first to his patron Sergei Shchukin, then to Ivan Morosov\u2014Gauguin\u2019s remarkable Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going? (1897\u201398; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), which must also have provided welcome inspiration as he contemplated his own monumental figure painting.\n\nMatisse\u2019s progress on Bathers by a River was significant enough to prompt questions about his ultimate plans for the work. Camoin, in a letter possibly from November 1913, asked\u2014no doubt responding to his friend\u2019s own comments\u2014whether he would be exhibiting the painting in the upcoming Salon d\u2019Automne. Around the beginning of that month, Matisse himself had arranged for Druet to photograph the picture (see fig. 25.44). The formal nature of the resulting image suggests that the artist identified this stage of the painting as worth documenting; his daughter, Marguerite, stated that he photographed his work when he felt it had reached a certain state of completion. In Druet\u2019s photograph, we see the painting, identified with the title Femmes nues, d\u00e9coratif, resting against the familiar beadboard paneling of the studio, propped up on two food crates with art materials gathered on the floor. Comparing the state of the composition to that in the image digitally stitched from the photos Coburn took four months earlier, we can begin to appreciate the major transformation that Matisse wrought even as he toiled over Back and the portrait of his wife, among other works. We can discern vestiges of the May canvas: at the top, the artist retained the high horizon, which is the source of the waterfall, as well as the general position of the four bathers and the snake, although in each case he either moved them up or fixed them more solidly in place. Gone are the details of the figures\u2019 faces and hair; they are now more generalized, faceless women. Also new are the details of the bathers\u2019 environment\u2014the leafy parts of plants, the rippling surface of the water, and the repeated round forms of the trees\u2014elements, in fact, from Morocco and Issy that Matisse merged to form a new kind of imaginary landscape.\n\nExamination of the finished painting reveals the colors of this earlier composition; indeed, some are visible even today since Matisse retained parts of the May 1913 version\u2014especially the legs and torsos of the bathers\u2014throughout later painting campaigns (see fig. 25.45). Microscopic study and cross-sectional analysis confirm the range of light, medium, and dark grays that he used to cover the foliage, waterfall, and bodies (see fig. 25.46, fig. 25.47, fig. 25.48, fig. 25.49). By employing new imaging technology which has allowed us to colorize black-and-white archival photographs, we can reconstruct the palette of the canvas documented in Druet\u2019s photograph (fig. 25.50). This enables us to see that Matisse tamped down the earlier layers of pinks, greens, and blues and enveloped the whole in a palette of mottled grays. He shifted the color and mood of the picture dramatically by scumbling delicate layers of gray paint over the surface (see fig. 25.51), producing a pulsating rhythm that is echoed by the densely hatched brushwork found in other areas of the painting. The overall effect of outlined forms filled with thin, overlapping washes of gray is parallel to that of the drawing Matisse made after Dance (II) (c. 1910; fig. 25.52), which Sembat noted in an article in Les cahiers d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui: \u201cAfter Music, he regretted that Dance was not more sublimated, more restful, more nobly calm! And I know of a charcoal of Dance as he sees it now, where the movement is sweepingly solemn.\u201d It was likely around the time of the article\u2019s publication that the artist took up Bathers by a River again, three years after he brought it to some degree of parity with Dance (II) and Music before their debut at the Salon d\u2019Automne in 1910. With the charcoal drawing that he made after completing Dance (II), Matisse seemingly resolved his concerns about the vividly colored painting. The drawing, which he may have reencountered both in the article and on a visit to Sembat and Agutte, would have stirred him to take Bathers by a River in a new direction\u2014a process that we see beginning in Coburn\u2019s photographs of May 1913 and ending in Druet\u2019s of November.\n\nThese changes also relate to what may be Matisse\u2019s first lithograph of the period: Large Nude, an undated work often assigned to 1907 (fig. 25.53). With its abstracted human form and pose, the figure recalls the bather seated on the left side of the waterfall. It is unlike any other print that the artist made in that he worked the image directly on the stone, scraping down and adjusting it much like he did the bathers on his large-scale canvas. Moreover, he constructed the form out of a network of soft black and gray lines and with an atmospheric shadowing that parallels the palette of the painting. With its modeling and broad shading, the work contrasts with Matisse\u2019s other lithographs, which share a linear, economical style.\n\nIt is likely that the artist ended his work on Bathers by a River shortly after Druet\u2019s photograph was taken. This is suggested not only by his engagement of the photographer but also by the onset of cooler weather, which would have made his unheated studio inhospitable. In December the young art student Robert Rey visited Issy, and his impressions, recorded in a rare eyewitness account that was later published, describe a \u201cdeserted\u201d and \u201cfrigid\u201d studio. It was there that Rey encountered a \u201cscene in misty tones, highlighted with blue reflections, a strange scene where large figures can be made out, sketched in wide dark strokes.\u201d This cool, reduced canvas, of course, was the once idyllic, pastel-colored Bathers by a River, now dramatically transformed in mood and palette. It is noteworthy that Rey did not recognize the scene as an Arcadian one\u2014Matisse would further challenge the conventions of the theme in the next stages of work.\n\nBefore the artist started a new stage of this monumental, demanding picture, he played out its lessons in other works. Soon after Rey\u2019s visit, Matisse left his canvas in Issy and moved to Paris, where he worked on an ambitious set of paintings (see fig. 25.54) in a new studio, reducing, abstracting, and yet building form, particularly with the color gray. In August 1914 he was confronted by the outbreak of war and did not return to work in Issy until sometime in 1915. In the midst of personal and artistic challenges associated with the war, Matisse resumed painting, slowly rebuilding his practice after a long absence. At first he focused on The Moroccans, a canvas he had considered several times since his first trip to Morocco in 1912 but began only now, as North African soldiers became more visible on the streets of Paris. He likewise resumed two long-standing sculptural projects, producing Back (III) (1916, cast c. 1950; fig. 25.55) and Jeannette V (1916, cast c. 1930; Museum of Modern Art, New York). Each involved processes of scraping, incising, and elision, as well as additions of medium, to rework and distill form through geometric reduction, fragmentation, and abstraction. It was probably in early spring that Matisse turned again to his monumental bathers scene. The Danish artist Axel Salto visited Issy in April or May and saw the canvas in progress, remarking, \u201cMatisse was in the seventh year of working on an enormous painting that presented a row of figures placed next to each other in separate squares.\u201d A month or so later, on June 1, Matisse wrote to dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg to report that he had \u201ctaken up again a five-meter-wide painting showing bathing women.\u201d\n\nIn November 1916 the canvas was photographed by Bernheim-Jeune (fig. 25.56) looking markedly different from the state documented by Druet just three years earlier and very much like the version we know today. Comparing the 1913 and 1916 photographs reveals the great amount of work that Matisse must have done to transform the monumental painting. Gone is the monochromatic tonality and the narrative background of forested landscape and flowing waterfall; gone too is the method of modeling primarily with passages of pinks and grays. Instead, we see a far more animated and rigorously constructed composition distinguished on the one hand by a pronounced definition of constituent parts and, on the other, by a complex integration. No longer informed by the look of Analytical Cubism, the canvas took on a greater resemblance to the dynamic work of Juan Gris and Gino Severini as well as the continuing experiments of Braque and Picasso, including their papiers coll\u00e9s and Synthetic Cubist paintings.\n\nIn each of these iterations of Bathers by the River, the artist concentrated on what he called his \u201cmethods of modern construction,\u201d requiring them to be exactingly \u201ccomposed, willed, and technically perfect.\u201d This was a test of skill and conviction, as Matisse explained: \u201cOne should be able to rework a masterpiece at least once, to be very sure that one has not fallen victim\u2014to one\u2019s nerves or to fate.\u201d Indeed, these states function as records of the extraordinary standard he set for himself and as material signs of the sheer physical effort and time he committed. While Matisse labored, he chronicled his activities; his words suggest a connection between the challenges facing soldiers at the front and his own practice. To Camoin, Matisse confided, \u201cI\u2019m hoping to make it work, but what a lot of trouble. I\u2019m not in the trenches, but I worry anyway.\u201d And to Rosenberg, he allowed that his works were \u201cimportant . . . I can\u2019t say that it is not a struggle\u2014but it is not the real one.\u201d Earlier, in December 1914, after being rejected from military service, Matisse had asked his friend Sembat how he might still serve; Sembat\u2019s advice was \u201cto continue to paint well.\u201d While the works produced in 1916 do not directly reference the war in style or subject, their physical and mental challenge was part of Matisse\u2019s own response to the conflict.\n\nWhether self-imposed or inspired in part by the larger national dialogue on wartime cultural production, Matisse\u2019s purposeful reengagement with the challenge of continuing to \u201cpaint well\u201d is best expressed through Bathers by a River, and its centrality to his practice is key. Comparing the 1913 and 1916 states reveals the nature of Matisse\u2019s work but also the painting\u2019s connections to other canvases he was making around this time. Looking at Bathers by a River in 1916, we can see elements of the grid in Head, White and Rose (1914\u201315 [?]; Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris), the vertical registers of Goldfish and Palette (late Nov.1914\u2013early spring 1915; Museum of Modern Art, New York), the divided forms of Still Life after Jan Davidz. de Heem\u2019s \u201cLa desserte\u201d (summer\u2013fall,1915; fig. 25.57), the structured space of The Moroccans, and the distinct use of black in all of these. Perhaps most noteworthy are the many formal connections between Bathers and the third state of Back, which he made in the time between the 1913 and 1916 photographs. Indeed, according to the artist\u2019s son Pierre, the painting and bas-relief share a deep affinity, as both were produced in stages, side by side, in the Issy studio.\n\nA review of Matisse\u2019s changes to the figures in Bathers by a River between 1913 and 1916 reveals many issues of construction shared with Back (III). For instance, the artist made the standing bather on the left wider as well as more vertical, adding passages of gray, pink, and pale blue to fill the form; he also segmented her torso with dark vertical lines that are reminiscent of the deeply carved structure of Back (III). As a complement to the central axis of the sculpture, Matisse painted a shadowy hollow down her center. Likewise, he made her hips fuller and her stance more rigid, emphasizing a sense of weight with thick, trunk-like legs in a position similar to that in the bas-relief. While Matisse built mass with paint, he also reduced it on the rear of the left thigh, scraping away layers just as he removed plaster on Back (III).\n\nTo revise the second figure, Matisse scraped back the previous hood-like form of the head, exposing green and blue paint from the earliest, lowest level of the canvas. He worked this removal in such a way that the shape of a head is still suggested. Above, he incorporated a few of the earlier trees held in reserve into the elongated blue and gray forms that rise over the torso. While the overlapping trees recall the kind of faceting seen in Futurist works, their rounded, angled shape also echoes the head and enveloping left arm of Back (II). Matisse framed this bather with black lines that both divide and reinforce its construction. In addition, he positioned a set of rectangular planes at different depths in order to push parts of the figure forward while holding its center firmly to the ground. This likewise recalls the play of figure and ground in Back (III).\n\nThe third bather also sustained changes: Matisse raised the head, elongated the neck, straightened the body, and extended the left side, seemingly encasing it all within a narrow geometric niche. Thick, black lines divide and solidify the formerly soft figure, which he anchored to a black, vertical stripe that runs the height of the painting. The legs, filled with various scumbled shades of gray, play with transparency and opacity, as does the right hip, which is surrounded by dark gray paint. The sturdy, black contour lines of the thighs contrast with the thinner, overlapping forms of the lower half of the legs. Matisse gave this bather, too, a weighty permanence.\n\nThe artist subjected the standing figure on the right to some of the same types of changes, but she is far less segmented and geometrically constructed than her companions. Matisse defined the breasts clearly with black outlines, scraping the right one and repainting it with a darker pink. He widened the hips with black contours and filled out the legs with a lighter tone of gray, as if adding sculpting medium to the earlier state, which we can see just below the present layers. In addition, he lightened the lower legs by adding white over the dark gray, doing the same on the head; in this way, he extended the figure across the length of the canvas and gave it a far greater weight than before.\n\nWhile all of these changes demonstrate Matisse\u2019s deep, evolving concern with the construction of form, one of the most remarkable occurred in the background, as Salto suggested when he described the figures \u201cseparated in squares.\u201d By examining the X-ray and cross sections of the painting, together with information gleaned through analysis of the pigment, paint extenders, and fillers, we can chart the numerous combinations of background colors and bands that the artist considered while he was adjusting the figures. A series of illustrations (fig. 25.58) represents the likely evolution of his efforts. Research indicates that the artist repainted some vertical strips as many as six times, adjusting widths and altering colors; his most intense work, however, occurred on the left edge. Here we can see that he changed the band from light blue to white, black, and then white again before painting it in pale blue with a black leaf pattern. Later he covered the blue with green, holding the pattern in reserve; still not satisfied, he then filled the inside of the leaves with gray and the space between them with black, producing a dramatic, shadowy depth between the forms. In an inspired final step, pushing further the brush technique he deployed on the left edge of Bowl of Apples on a Table (1916; Chrysler Museum of Art, Norfolk), Matisse incised the contours of the leaves into the still-wet gray paint, much as he had in his monotypes. As he did for Back, he scraped down layers of medium applied earlier in order to reinforce the reserved silhouettes. His removals uncovered greens from the original composition along with colors closer to the top layer, which blended with the wet gray paint from the surface, producing a kind of marbleized effect.\n\nThe sheer effort required to transform this large-scale picture so radically\u2014and at the same time evoke the history of its production through its layered surface\u2014is a clear indication of Matisse\u2019s great desire to challenge himself at the height of the war. We might also think of its surface as sign of his thinking about the theme of Arcadia at this time, of his merging of the past and present, and of a certain duality. In August 1916, even before the work was photographed, Rosenberg recognized what Matisse would achieve with the painting and asked to put it on reserve. The artist, however, was not yet ready to finalize the picture, and in the end, the November photograph came to serve as a document of yet another stage in its ongoing evolution.\n\nOver the years, commentators have questioned whether Matisse ever really finished his bathers composition, citing a 1978 statement by his daughter, Marguerite, in which she said that he did not consider it truly complete. Bathers by a River was indeed a picture with a long gestation and one to which the artist returned over numerous painting campaigns: this publication acknowledges at least six separate occasions including the present final state, although others not yet documented by physical or archival evidence could certainly exist. What is clear is that the artist, freed early in this work\u2019s genesis from the obligation to tailor it to the needs of a donor or dealer, employed it as central vehicle for his ambitious experiments. Given the painting\u2019s continual presence in his studio for so many years as well as its connections with numerous works from 1909 through 1917 and beyond, we might consider Marguerite\u2019s statement as an indication not of the picture\u2019s lack of completion, but rather of Matisse\u2019s enduring relationship with it.\n\nThat said, there are no extant historical records that securely document his completion of the painting. The only firm date, in fact, is September 14, 1926, when he sold Bathers by a River\u2014along with The Piano Lesson (late summer 1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York), The Lorrain Chair (1919; private collection), and probably Bather (1909; Museum of Modern Art, New York)\u2014to the dealer Paul Guillaume, who in turn offered it to the American collector Albert Barnes, praising it as \u201cvery large and sumptuous.\u201d The canvas was also photographed by Guillaume (fig. 25.59) at this time, and the resulting image shows the painting as we know it today, signed in the lower left corner.\n\nAlthough Bathers by a River was sold in 1926, Matisse\u2019s departure for Nice in October 1917 makes it rather more likely that he completed the canvas sometime during that year. In February 1917 the Lebanese writer Ameen Rihani visited the Issy studio, where he witnessed the painting still in process and the artist still unsure about it himself. Rihani later wrote of his experience in an article about artists in wartime, poignantly documenting the artist\u2019s continued work over the winter:\n\nA footpath from the door-steps leads to another house, half-concealed by the trees, which is his studio. He would have been glad if it were in the Sahara that winter. He warned us, when we expressed a desire to see it, against its North-Pole atmosphere. Mettez votre pardessus, Monsieur. And he slipped on a sleeveless overcoat, a contrivance of his own, to overcome, while working, the cold and coalless winter. He was right. We shivered for ten minutes amidst a confusion of unfinished tableaux on which we could not warm even our imagination. Only when the North wind subsides and the sun shines does he come here to while away a few hours at an old tableau, on which he had been working spasmodically for the last six years and which promised to be a masterpiece of\u2014Cubism, Futurism, Fauvism?\u2014he himself does not know. And there it stood, a huge canvas in greys, which baffles the understanding. And the Master, to add to our perplexity and embarrassment, asked us if we thought it had anything in it of Cubism. Alas, Monsieur Matisse is afraid, I think, of becoming a Cubist and he is just as much afraid, alas! alas! of not becoming a Cubist. He would make up his mind, I suppose, if he could foresee the ultimate course of the destiny of Cubism. Meanwhile, he will go on doing his best to overcome the perplexity within him. And if he has hauled down the flag in the revolution, he continues to experiment on what he believes to be a new expression of art.\n\nWe can identify changes that date to this time by physical examination and the comparison of the November 1916 Bernheim-Jeune and September 1926 Guillaume photographs.\n\nEvidence points to a much subtler reworking in 1917, one that was focused less on deep structure than on surface and light. Unlike his bold, large-scale transformations of 1916, at this time Matisse attended more slowly to two specific areas where he made quiet adjustments. The first was the left edge: here he continued to work on the leaves, lightly scraping back prominent black brushstrokes within the forms, reshaping contours, and cleaning the lines. Inside the leaves, he also incised over the scraped areas, revealing more color\u2014especially white\u2014from the lower layers (see fig. 25.60). These changes, which complement the zigzagging brushwork in the green paint on the other side of the first figure, give the left edge a greater sense of depth and soft volume, bringing more cohesion to the whole. The artist also revised the band between the third and fourth figures: he added white over the blue in a thin, brushy scumble (see fig. 25.61), a combination that prefigures some of the pictures from his early Nice period, including The Lorrain Chair, Plaster Figure with Bouquet of Flowers (1919; Museu de Arte de S\u00e3o Paulo), and especially Interior at Nice (see cat. 30), with its ethereal effects of light. Here the stiff, frothy texture produced by Matisse\u2019s brush through the white paint contrasts with the denser band of white in front of the third bather; it also echoes the patterns in the blue band behind the fourth figure, where he moved his brush quickly through still-wet paint to reveal passages of the earlier gray color. These adjustments, at once additive and reductive, allowed him to bring greater unity to the painting\u2019s composition and surface. The changes are different in character from the mostly structural revisions of 1916 and suggest the shift that Matisse would begin to execute as he transitioned to Nice.\n\nBut what, after eight years of work, did the composition represent? Surely, what was once connected to repose and idyll was, by the middle of World War I, something else, but it may be far too simple to suggest a wartime, nostalgic paradise lost. Bathers by a River was a \u201cpivotal\u201d canvas for the artist, as he once stated, and its density\u2014its \u201ccomplex realization,\u201d to borrow the words he used in 1936 to describe C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Three Bathers\u2014is at the crux of our understanding. As mentioned previously, in the spring of 1916, when Salto visited Matisse\u2019s studio in Issy and saw the canvas in progress he described it as\u2014\u201can enormous painting that presented a row of figures placed next to each other in separate squares.\u201d He might have been surprised to know that Matisse still saw in the canvas a scene of \u201cbathing women,\u201d as he described to Rosenberg in 1916. This receptive disjuncture suggests that rather than focus simply on its formal character or thematic origins, we must think of its extraordinary surface, which pulls us into its past but also draws the past into its present. We must not consider Arcadia just as a subject matter, or bathers just as a kind of ready-made motif for formal experimentation; rather, we must identify the dynamic interconnectedness that gives Bathers by a River its great power.\n\nWe are justifiably unable to find a single reading of this work: it reflects on a grand scale the many sources of Matisse\u2019s inspiration, from Arcadian images by artists ranging from the Old Masters to C\u00e9zanne, to the avant-garde developments of Cubism and Futurism, to Matisse\u2019s own inventive approaches to construction and abstraction and his concentration on specific subjects and forms of expression. Bathers by a River evaded definitive summary in the years that followed its public debut in 1926, and continues to do so today, despite the fact that we are far more aware of its thematic and compositional complexities than ever. Indeed, the painting\u2019s subject and formal innovations are inextricably linked, for while the canvas continually moved away from its original and more obviously Arcadian roots, Matisse never forgot its history. There is, in fact, a deep connection between the method of making and the subject matter within the work\u2019s surface. Always knowing what was below, the artist scraped down to older layers, weaving into the present image colors applied earlier and hints of previous. The subject of Arcadia was continually at the foundation of his reworking, likely contested, adjusted, discounted, and perhaps even longed for with each new stage.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\n1926: Jeunes Filles au bain/Jeunes filles au bain (Sylvain Bonmariage, \u201cHenri Matisse et la peinture pure,\u201d Cahiers d\u2019art 9 [1926], pp. 239, 240.)\n\nOct. 7, 1926: Les Demoiselles de la Riviera (Andr\u00e9 Warnod, \u201cLes expositions de la semaine: Retour de vacances\u2014Henri Matisse,\u201d Com\u0153dia [Oct. 7, 1926], p. 3.)\n\n1929: Femmes au ruisseau (Florant Fels, Henri-Matisse [Chroniques du Jour, 1929], pl. 10.)\n\n1930: Women by a Stream (Roger Fry, Henri-Matisse [Chroniques du Jour/A.

Barr\u2019s exhibition and complementary monograph (Alfred H. Barr, Matisse: His Art and His Public [1951]) were the products of years of research and direct interviews with the artist; his work remains a major source for any scholar of Matisse. This essay is adapted from Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro and John Elderfield, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917 (Art Institute of Chicago/Museum of Modern Art, New York/Yale University Press, 2010).\n\nAccording to Katharine Kuh, curator of modern art in the 1950s, the New York collector Henry Pearlman approached Art Institute director Daniel Catton Rich about the exchange since Matisse\u2019s canvas was \u201ctoo big to put up in his apartment.\u201d This information comes from a May 23, 1986, interview of Katharine Kuh by Courtney Donnell concerning the painting\u2019s history; curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis damage has long since been repaired; in 2008 paintings conservator Kristin Hoermann Lister expertly treated the monumental canvas. A full treatment history is published with this study and available in the object file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nCourtney Donnell, interview with Katharine Kuh, May 23, 1986, curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse. The majority of the present essay has been adapted from this publication.\n\nOn Matisse\u2019s engagement with these themes, see especially Thomas Puttfarken, \u201cMutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and \u2018gli amori de\u2019 Carracci,\u201d Burlington Magazine 124, no. 949 (Apr. 1982), pp. 203\u201308; Werth, Joy of Life; and Alastair Wright, Matisse and the Subject of Modernism (Princeton University Press, 2004).\n\nMatisse cited the source of the painting\u2019s title as Baudelaire in a letter to Simon Bussy on September 19, 1905, Archives du Mus\u00e9e du Louvre et des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Paris. Henri-Edmond Cross referenced \u201cyour \u2018Arcadia\u2019\u201d in response to a letter Matisse had penned to him earlier that month, Cross to Matisse, Oct. 1905, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.

The esquisse peinte (painted sketch) played an important role in the French academic tradition of historical, mythological, and religious painting from the seventeenth century onward. Traditionally, an esquisse was looser, smaller, and more spontaneous than the finished tableau.\n\nAlfred H. Barr, Jr., Questionnaire VI, Mar.\u2013Apr. 1951, facilitated by John Rewald, Museum of Modern Art Archives, New York, AHB 11.l.B.1a.ii. Barr noted the date of the commission differently.\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, Mar. 6, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. Some important historical points should be noted when reviewing the Shchukin-Matisse correspondence. First, the Russian calendar differed from the Western calendar at this time by thirteen days. This study follows the French dates. According to Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant of the Archives Henri Matisse, Shchukin often double-dated his correspondence to account for this difference, and every attempt has been made to confirm the dates of all existing letters and drafts noted here. In this case, Shchukin dated the letter 21 Fev/4 Mar, mistaking the number of days in the month. The correct date in the French calendar would be March 6. Second, Albert Kostenevich and Natalia Semyonova noted that at the time of the commission, letters sent from Russia took three to four days to arrive in Paris, Kostenevich and Semyonova, Collecting Matisse, p. 106.\n\nHenri Matisse to Sergei Shchukin, draft letter, Mar. 11, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. His description suggests that the collector had seen the composition as an \u00e9bauche, the first stage of blocking in a painting with a light contour sketch.\n\nFlam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, p. 495n22.\n\nMatisse to Shchukin, Mar. 6, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nNo letter or draft can be found in the Archives Henri Matisse; this information is inferred by Sergei Shchukin\u2019s letter of March 16 thanking Matisse for the watercolors he sent on March 12. While variations of the title Bathers by a River are documented in a number of photographic and archival records, nothing dating from Matisse\u2019s earliest work on the picture gives any indication of a title beyond the watercolor\u2019s, Composition No. II; thus, the present-day title has been retained in this discussion.\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, Mar. 16, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nShchukin\u2019s unrelated letter was dated March 19; if it was sent the same day, it would have arrived at Matisse\u2019s home about four days later; see Kostenevich and Semyonova, Collecting Matisse, pp. 103, 106.\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, Mar. 27, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris; Shchukin referred to Matisse\u2019s \u201cletter of 23 March.\u201d See Kostenevich and Semyonova, Collecting Matisse, p. 164, for the full text of the correspondence.\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, telegram, Mar. 28, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nCharles Estienne, \u201cDes tendances de la peinture moderne: Entretien avec M.

The interview was published on April 12 but likely took place before March 28, the date on which Matisse\u2019s daughter, Marguerite, underwent a serious operation. In a letter dated April 4 or 5, Matisse wrote to Albert Marquet that he missed the opening of the Salon due to Marguerite\u2019s condition. For more information on the potential date of the interview, see Neff, \u201cMatisse and Decoration, 1906\u20131914,\u201d p. 180n164; and Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, p. 495n24.\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, Mar. 31, 1909, Pierre Matisse Gallery Archives, Department of Literary and Historical Manuscripts, MA5020, box 187, folder 15, Morgan Library and Museum. The telegram Shchukin mentioned is the one he sent March 28.\n\nHenri Matisse to Sergei Shchukin, draft letter, Apr. 9, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. The \u201cidea in [Shchukin\u2019s] hands\u201d is surely the watercolor Composition No. II. Thanks to Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant for sharing this important document and confirming its date.\n\nThe process of Henri Matisse\u2019s work on Back parallels many of the campaigns of Bathers by a River, and the works became even more connected once Matisse moved to a new studio in Issy-les-Moulineaux in the fall of 1909, where they sat next to each other. The shared gestation of these works and their influence on one another is chronicled in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 72\u201375, 102\u201303, 158\u201363, 300\u201303.\n\nWith his Arcadian theme, Matisse engaged the long tradition of painted d\u00e9corations, pictures of historical or mythical subjects intended to evoke tranquility and uplift. The decorative paintings popularized by Bonnard and Denis, for example, often focused on a classical form of myth that merged the French Mediterranean with the ideals of harmony, balance, and purity. For more on the fascinating history of d\u00e9coration as it pertains to late nineteenth- and twentieth-century France, see Nancy Troy, Modernism and the Decorative Arts in France: Art Nouveau to Le Corbusier (Yale University Press, 1991); and Gloria Groom, Beyond the Easel: Decorative Painting by Bonnard, Vuillard, Denis, and Roussel, 1890\u20131930 (Art Institute of Chicago/Yale University Press, 2001).\n\nMarcel Sembat, \u201cHenri Matisse,\u201d Les cahiers d\u2019aujourd\u2019hui 4 (Apr. 1913), p. 191. Years later, Matisse would also recall the experience in a series of letters to the Russian critic Alexander Romm; see M. Alpatov, Matisse: Peinture, sculpture, oeuvre graphique, lettres (Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts/State Hermitage Museum, 1969), pp. 130\u201334.\n\nFor more on the studio, see Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, pp. 86\u201389, 198\u2013200, esp. figs. 62, 64.\n\nElderfield confirmed the location of Bathers by a River in the Issy studio with Pierre Matisse; see Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, p. 198. See also Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, p. 272, for the possible identification of Bathers by a River in Still Life with \u201cDance.\u201d\n\nSergei Shchukin to Henri Matisse, Sept. 3, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nAccording to Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant, the new atelier was in place by this date. It was constructed by the Compagnie des Constructions D\u00e9montables et Hygi\u00e8niques, Paris.\n\nHenri Matisse to Sergei Shchukin, Mar. 11, 1909, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nDetailed technical examinations of Dance (II) and Music were not possible for this study, given their fragile states. Based on Matisse\u2019s method of gridded transfer for the large-scale composition Le luxe (see D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 60\u201365), we might consider whether a similar solution was employed and the transfer medium wiped off before painting. Given his changing techniques at this same time, however, we cannot be certain without further study.\n\nThis photograph has traditionally been thought to be by Edward Steichen, but it is identified in Roland Dorgel\u00e8s, \u201cLe prince des Fauves,\u201d Fantasio (Dec. 1, 1910), p. 299, as \u201cHenri Matisse working on Dance, P(hoto) Manuel.\u201d The Manuel Fr\u00e8res was a well-known photography company at the turn of the last century. Henri Manuel also photographed a number of Matisse\u2019s friends and colleagues, including Auguste Rodin, Georgette Agutte, and Marcel Sembat.\n\nMatisse would later tell Alfred Barr, Jr., that he made the painting in Collioure without thought of a decoration; see Alfred H. Barr, Jr., Questionnaire V, Aug. 1950, facilitated by John Rewald, Museum of Modern Art Archives, New York, AHB 11.l.B.1a.ii. For more on the painting, see Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, pp. 52\u201354.\n\nFor more on dating of the photograph, see Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cOpportunity and Invention,\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, p. 80.\n\nIn 1920 this photograph was published in Sembat\u2019s monograph Henri Matisse among reproductions of artworks as La musique (Premier \u00e9tat) and was mistakenly dated to 1911.\n\nGeorgette Agutte to Henri Matisse, Apr. 2, 1910, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. It is worth noting that Agutte used the term esquisse for the panels, though she might have been using the term less to identify sketches than the panels of a decorative ensemble. Her identification of Music as the \u201cthird panel\u201d may suggest continued activity on Bathers by a River.\n\nThis photograph was first published in Marcel Sembat, Henri Matisse. Les peintres fran\u00e7ais nouveaux, vol. 1 (\u00c9ditions de la Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise, 1920). The circumstances in which Druet took this and an earlier photograph of Music are not fully known, but given the growing evidence of Matisse\u2019s desire to record his progress on many works at this time, we can assume that he engaged the photographer specifically for this purpose, as well as to have something to send to Shchukin.\n\nAs additional evidence of Matisse\u2019s detailed focus on revision from Dance (I) to Dance (II) and Music, as well as Bathers by a River, we should note the sculpture Study of a Foot (Duthuit 43), possibly dating to fall 1909.\n\nGeorgette Agutte to Henri Matisse, Apr. 2, 1910, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nHenri Matisse to Jean Biette, n.d. [end of May 1910], Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nHenri Matisse to Sergei Shchukin, n.d. [end of May 1910], Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nIt is worth noting that one of the paintings Matisse made after receiving the commission, but before traveling to Cavali\u00e8re for the summer, was Nude with a White Scarf (Mar.\u2013May 1909; fig. 23), with its own intense red background, perhaps an early consideration of the palette that would later be chosen for Dance (II) and Music.\n\nWe know, for example, Matisse\u2019s thoughts immediately after the ordeal. He wrote from Spain to Jean Biette, saying that he was \u201cunwilling to do new pictures to explain the preceding ones\u201d; Matisse to Biette, Jan. 9, 1911, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nSembat, \u201cHenri Matisse,\u201d p. 191. Sembat even brought up Dance (II) and Music: \u201cDance made people scream by the magnificent audacity of its design, Dance compelled everyone\u2019s recognition through the wild leap of movement that carries it away! After Music, he regretted that Dance was not more sublimated, more restful, more nobly calm! And I know of a charcoal of Dance as he sees it now, where the movement is sweepingly solemn.\u201d\n\nWe know, for example, that Matisse sent a copy of the article to both Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morosov. To the latter, he described the essay as \u201cthe best that has been written about me.\u201d Matisse to Morosov, May 25, 1913, Archives Morosov, Moscow; Kostenevich and Semyonova, Collecting Matisse, p. 185. Shchukin purchased The Moroccan Caf\u00e9 by the end of the summer; on Sept. 15, Matisse wrote to Charles Camoin reporting the sale of the painting, Matisse to Camoin, Sept. 15, 1913, Archives Camoin, Paris. For more on the acquisition, see Jack Cowart, Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912\u20131913 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, 1990), pp. 266, 269nn75\u201376.\n\nFor more on this possible production date, see D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 134\u201337; and R\u00e9mi Labrusse, \u201cL\u2019epreuve de Tanger,\u201d in Delpont, Le Maroc de Matisse, p. 49.\n\nCoburn wrote in his text for Men of Mark, \u201cA journey to Paris gave me the opportunity of meeting and photographing Matisse, and I was glad to include the portrait of so able and interesting an artist\u201d; Alvin Langdon Coburn, Men of Mark (Duckworth and Co./M. Kennerley, 1913), p. 29. Coburn dated the text May 27, 1913, and took his photographs of Matisse at the very end of the process of compiling the book, which came out in October.\n\nThis reconstruction (as well as the majority of the digital infrared images and X-rays for this study of Bathers by a River) is the work of Robert G. Erdmann of the University of Arizona.\n\nWe should consider that since Bathers by a River remained in Matisse\u2019s studio between 1910 and 1913 and had been the focus of innovation and experimentation during the production of the Shchukin panels, it is possible that the artist worked on the canvas to some degree before May 1913. Its presence in the studio also might have inspired other paintings; for example, the center pair of bathers in the Chicago canvas recalls the figures of the artist\u2019s sons, Pierre and Jean, in the middle of another large-scale Shchukin commission of these years, The Painter\u2019s Family (1911; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg).\n\nMatisse would also use this vertical structuring for his work on Back (III), which he was likely focusing on concurrently.\n\nThe technique is similar to one Matisse used for the left elbow of the second figure in the later, completed painting.\n\nPierre Schneider, Jack Cowart, and Laura Coyle, \u201cTriptychs, Triads, and Trios: Groups of Three in Matisse\u2019s Paintings of the Moroccan Period,\u201d in Cowart, Matisse in Morocco, pp. 270\u201374.\n\nHenri Matisse to Alvin Langdon Coburn, postmarked June 16, 1913, Archives, International Museum of Photography at George Eastman House, Rochester, New York.\n\nHenri Matisse to Charles Camoin, Sept. 15, 1913, Archives Camoin, Paris.\n\nEva Gouel to Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas, July 22, 1913, Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas Papers, Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University. Gouel wrote: \u201cMatisse comes often to ask for news about Picasso. And today he has brought Pablo some flowers and spent practically the afternoon with us. He is very agreeable.\u201d\n\nHenri Matisse to Gertrude Stein, Sept. 3, 1913. On August 29, Picasso likewise reported to Stein that he and Matisse went \u201cfor walks in the woods of Clamart with horses.\u201d Both letters are in the Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas Papers, Yale Collection of American Literature, Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale University.\n\nIn addition, as we know from Alvin Langdon Coburn\u2019s photographs of Matisse working on Back (III), he was marking his plaster with varying intensities of color\u2014probably different dilutions of slip\u2014before cutting away with his chisel and hammer. The monochrome effect of this sculpting process paralleled his canvases at this time.\n\nClaudine Grammont assigned this undated letter to Nov. 1913; Grammont, Correspondance entre Charles Camoin et Henri Matisse (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1997), p. 57. Camoin wrote to Matisse: \u201cHave you sent Bathers [La baignade] to the Salon?\u201d It is worth noting that Matisse called the painting Baigneuse in his mid-Sept. letter to Camoin, and that Camoin, in turn, gave it a slightly different title. While they relate to the same subject, the different titles may indicate that there was another painting about which Camoin had inquired.\n\nThis date was determined by the circumstances of Matisse\u2019s participation in Alfred Flechtheim\u2019s inaugural exhibition of December 1913. There Matisse presented a number of paintings including the now-lost Femmes baigneuses (1909; known today as Nymph and Faun), Nasturtiums with the Painting Dance (1912; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and The Red Studio (1911; Museum of Modern Art, New York), as well as sculptures, drawings, and prints. By the end of October, Flechtheim was impatiently awaiting photographs of the works to include in his catalogue; these, the dealer reported in a letter of November 4, 1913, were being taken by Druet. Today a set of Druet\u2019s glass negatives (R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, Fonds Pompidou, Druet-Vizzavona) include the print of Bathers by a River as illustrated here, suggesting that he took the photographs to send to Flechtheim. See correspondence between Flechtheim and Matisse, Oct. 27\u2013Nov. 11, 1913, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.\n\nElderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, p. 72, no. 6.\n\nAnnotated version of Druet\u2019s 1913 photograph, curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRobert Rey, who would visit Matisse at the end of the year and see the canvas, called the figures personnages, demonstrating the degree to which they had moved from their original identification as bathers.\n\nThis groundbreaking technology was developed by Sotirios A. Tsaftaris and Aggelos K. Katsaggelos of Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.\n\nSembat, \u201cHenri Matisse,\u201d p. 193.\n\nJohn Neff, following Barr in Barr, Matisse, p. 99, cat. 7, proposed that Large Nude, which is typically dated to 1906, be reassigned to 1913 based on the March 1, 1914, edition of Bernheim-Jeune\u2019s Bulletin 3, n. pag. That publication lists a lithograph printed in an edition of fifty on Chine-Chine and measuring 450 by 350 millimeters. Founded on the known prints made by Matisse and published in Duthuit-Matisse and Duthuit, Henri Matisse: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre grave, 2 vols. (C. Duthuit, 1983), p. 403, Neff\u2019s thesis, which includes the possibility that Matisse reworked the stone in 1913 from a 1906 composition, warrants serious consideration. See Neff, \u201cHenri Matisse: Notes on His Early Prints,\u201d in David Moorman, ed., Matisse Prints from the Museum of Modern Art (Fort Worth Art Museum/Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1986), p. 19, cat. 16. Working a lithographic stone years after it was made would have been a difficult task for an artist like Matisse, who made lithographs exclusively through transfer and did not print his own impressions until late 1913 and early 1914. The proposal here is simply that as Matisse began to look at printmaking as another possibility for exploration, he began this image, which he made on a stone in 1913.\n\nRobert Rey, \u201cUne heure chez,\u201d L\u2019opinion 7, no. 2 (Jan. 10, 1914), p. 60.\n\nOther paintings executed during this period are View of Notre Dame (Jan.\u2013mid-Feb. 1914; Museum of Modern Art, New York), Interior with Goldfish (Jan.\u2013mid-Mar. 1914; Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne/Centre de Cr\u00e9ation Industrielle, Centre Pompidou, Paris), Woman on a High Stool (1914; Museum of Modern Art, New York), Still Life with Lemons (1914; Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence), and Branch of Lilacs (1914; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).\n\nAxel Salto, \u201cHenri Matisse,\u201d Klingen 1, no. 7 (Apr. 1918), n. pag.\n\nHenri Matisse to L\u00e9once Rosenberg, June 1, 1916, manuscript department, Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne; a copy of the letter also resides in the Alfred H.

Barr, Jr., have identified this photograph as that of the completed work, although it is not.\n\nAn additional indication of the painting\u2019s transformation can be seen in its title at this time, which, according to Dauberville and Dauberville, Matisse, vol. 1, pp. 568\u201369, cat. 166, was Trois personnages debout, demonstrating a move to a much more abstracted concept.\n\nFor Matisse\u2019s phrase \u201cmethods of modern construction,\u201d see E. T\u00e9riade, \u201cMatisse Speaks,\u201d pt. 2, Art News Annual 50, no. 7 (Nov. 1951), p. 42.

Fayard, 1956), pp. 96\u201397.\n\nFor more on this particular aspect of the work, see Albert E. Elsen, \u201cThe Sculpture of Matisse, Part IV,\u201d Artforum 7, no. 4 (Dec. 1968), pp. 24\u201332; Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, p. 78; and Flam, Matisse: The Man and His Art, pp. 416\u201319, who also made note of the telling connection between the 1916 version of the figure and Matisse\u2019s Three Bathers by C\u00e9zanne.\n\nMatisse played with this newly constructed space\u2014for example, in the bather\u2019s right knee. Here it is pushed so far forward into the viewer\u2019s space that it is literally painted out of focus.\n\nThe material composition of the bands was determined to be frequently different than those of the pigments Matisse used for earlier states of the composition. The paint in the bands contains elements most likely added as inexpensive extenders or fillers during World War I, when raw materials may have been hard to come by. It is also possible that the artist added the materials himself in order to extend the paint or adjust its qualities, making it more matte and stiff or giving it a more textured tooth. It might have resulted in an opaquer paint or a more transparent one, depending on the ratio of oil binder to pigment and extender. For example, the pale blue and white bands on the right side are stiff but relatively transparent; the bright green band on the right is more smooth, fluid, and transparent.\n\nIn July 1916, Camoin wrote to Matisse, \u201cYour painting staggered me a little, [I was] disconcerted probably because I did not have the time to really understand it, I understand the logic of the big black area with bands of white, and yet it leaves me somewhat anxious, still a bit of leftover prejudice perhaps\u201d; Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. Claudine Grammont suggested that this may be a reference to Bathers by a River; Grammont, Correspondance entre Charles Camoin et Henri Matisse, p. 102. Indeed, at one point in the process of evolution, the bands produced a stable pattern of green, black, white, and blue; however, this comment may be too soon in Matisse\u2019s many months of work on the painting to actually be about this canvas, and not, perhaps, The Moroccans.\n\nOn this date, Matisse wrote in his personal notebook, \u201cSaw Rosenberg in Chatou. Had a visit from him the next day. Asked to be #1 for the canvas of bathers.\u201d Thanks to the Archives Henri Matisse, Paris, for sharing this information for this publication.\n\nSee Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, p. 189.\n\nHe might, for example, have returned to the canvas in summer 1911, when he could have been working on Back (II); he was also pursuing other large compositions at the time.\n\nPaul Guillaume to Henri Matisse, Sept. 14, 1926, Archives Henri Matisse, Paris. Included with this sale was another canvas, which Guillaume referred to as \u201cthe nude done with Brouty which was hung on the wall of the large studio, 30 canvas.\u201d This is very likely Bather (1909; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which is a standard-size no. 30 canvas and for which Loulou Brouty was the model. If this is indeed the case, this reinforces the relationship between Bathers by a River and Bather for the artist. Guillaume would exhibit Bathers by a River, The Piano Lesson, and Branch of Lilacs (1914; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) together in a small exhibition that ran October 1\u201314, 1926, and was inaugurated with a special lecture by Georges Duthuit and a musical performance by pianist Marcelle Meyer. For more on the exhibition, see D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 351\u201353.\n\nGuillaume described the work to Barnes as \u201ca very large and sumptuous painting\u2014rather abstract\u2014representing four figures by the side of a river.\u201d The collector declined the offer, stating that both Bathers by a River and The Piano Lesson \u201clook like very important ones and one of them is the largest Matisse I ever heard of. The two large ones should go into a public museum and I fear that you will have trouble in selling them to a private collector.\u201d See Paul Guillaume to Albert Barnes, Sept. 14, 1926, and Barnes to Guillaume, Oct. 6, 1926, President\u2019s Files, Albert C. Barnes Correspondence, Barnes Foundation Archives, Merion, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis photograph was critical in the treatment of the painting, providing important historical confirmation of what researchers and conservators\u2019 examinations pointed to as the work\u2019s original look.\n\nThe earliest publications of the painting date the work to 1918 and 1917; see Bonmariage, \u201cHenri Matisse et la penture pure,\u201d pp. 239\u2013 40; and Fels, Henri Matisse, n.pag., respectively.\n\nRihani\u2019s visit was published in the second section of a two-part article in International Studio, Dec. 1918 and July 1919. In the first part, Rihani discussed visiting Paris at the time of the deaths of the artist Carolus-Duran (Feb. 17, 1917) and the writer Octave Mirabeau (Feb. 16, 1917). Based on this, and the season clearly described in his interview with Matisse, Rihani must have seen the artist in the winter of that same year, despite the much later publication dates. See \u201cArtists in War-Time,\u201d International Studio 66, no. 262 (Dec. 1918), pp. xxix\u2013xxxvii; and 68, no. 269 (July 1919), pp. iii\u2013viii.\n\nSome of these marks might have been made with a special palette knife that Pierre Matisse told Nicolas Watkins his father had used to rework the layers of The Piano Lesson; see Nicholas Watkins, Matisse (Phaidon, 1984), p. 138.\n\nThis white-over-blue combination recalls Picasso\u2019s Les demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which Matisse had seen on several occasions, including at the 1916 Salon d\u2019Antin.\n\nSalto, \u201cHenri Matisse,\u201d n.pag.\n\nHenri Matisse to L\u00e9once Rosenberg, June 1, 1916.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 25 Bathers by a River, March 1909\u201310, May\u2013November 1913, and early spring 1916\u2013October (?) 1917.\n\nfig. 25.1 Henri Matisse (French, 1869\u20131954).
