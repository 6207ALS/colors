With him came virtually all of the portable works he had executed there\u2014from sketchbooks and manuscripts to paintings and sculptures. He began work on a project he planned to publish as Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, writing a text about his first sojourn in French Polynesia and then proceeding to produce a suite of wood-block prints to illustrate it. To relate his experiences in the prints, he drew upon a vocabulary of themes and motifs explored continually in paintings, carved wooden sculptures, and illustrated manuscripts that he had produced in Tahiti. While the prints\u2019 imagery is culled from these multiple sources, a collage of motifs that he would endlessly recombine, Gauguin nonetheless succeeded in presenting his visual texts in a cohesive fashion.\n\nIn addition to his own work, the suite reflects the degree to which Gauguin was influenced by two photographs (fig. 1 and fig. 2) that he took with him to Tahiti showing several sections of the reliefs, carved in volcanic rock, that adorn the ninth-century Buddhist temple complex of Borobudur, in Magelang, Central Java. The photographs belong to a suite of fifty-two taken by Isidore van Kinsbergen in 1873 that was published the following year. The reliefs, which narrate the life and teachings of the Buddha on his journey to enlightenment, comprise conjoined individual rectangular panels, horizontal in orientation, which extend across the complex\u2019s walls. The Noa Noa wood-block prints are also rectangular, and seven of the ten are horizontal. That Gauguin conceived the suite as separate but connected panel-like images reflects the degree to which he absorbed the photographs\u2019 visual content, as do many individual motifs, inspired by the reliefs, that appear throughout the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nThe Tahitian phrase noa noa translates in French as \u201codorant,\u201d and in English as \u201cperfumed,\u201d \u201cfragrant scent,\u201d or \u201cfragrant.\u201d Gauguin first gave the title to a painting of 1892 that he showed at Durand-Ruel and that did not sell. An analysis of the work, which is now lost and of which we have only a monochromatic photograph (fig. 3 [W 487]), helps illuminate the meaning of the title and of the series of wood-block prints Gauguin would begin in 1893. While no color reproduction of the painting exists, the canvas would have possessed the brilliant palette and intensity of his other paintings of the period (see, for example, cat. 51, fig. 51.5 [W 431]). The image featured luxuriant vegetation that grew in the environs of the artist\u2019s dwelling in the Mataiea district, on the southern coast of Tahiti-Nui (northwest Tahiti) (see fig. 4). This is confirmed by comparing the painting with numerous extant, related works depicting the foliage and flora he observed around his home (see, for example, cat. 51, figs. 51.10 [W 486] and 51.13 [W 481]). Gauguin described the setting:\n\nI am no longer in Papeete but rather in the district of Mataiea. On one side is the sea and on the other the mountain\u2014a beauty of a mountain, with a formidable crevasse, the view of which is [partly] blocked by an enormous group of mango trees abutting it. Between the mountain and the sea is my cabin, made of hibiscus branches. And near my cabin is another small house\u2014Fare amu for eating.\n\nIndeed, mountains and a striking, large mango tree, situated at the front of a grove of mangoes, dominate the background of the lost Noa Noa canvas. The mango (see fig. 5) is flanked on either side by coconut palms (see fig. 6). To its right is a banana tree (see fig. 7). A clump of sword-shaped leaves, dominating the immediate foreground, is possibly a peacock plant (see fig. 8). In nature the plant\u2019s blossoms appear irregularly (Gauguin did not show them in bloom in the painting), but when they do (see fig. 9), they are very fragrant. Behind this plant is a white or light-colored flowering shrub that might be the intoxicatingly sweet-scented caperbush (see fig. 10), the fragrant Pacific caper (see fig. 11), or, less likely, the pua veo veo (see fig. 12; the Tahitian name for this plant, which translates as \u201cstinking flower,\u201d is actually a misnomer, since the pua veo veo flower itself is fragrant, while the plant\u2019s leaves and fruit emit a bad odor when ripe or touched). While he sought to capture the essence of the luxuriant natural environment of Mataiea, Gauguin did not aim at botanical accuracy; rather, his representations of the flowers, shrubs, and trees found around him are suggestive and impressionistic. The artist\u2019s approach to nature was captured by the poet Charles Morice, with whom he would collaborate in an attempt to publish his Noa Noa manuscript. Clearly, the following statement must have touched a chord in Gauguin, since he copied it into the manuscript:\n\nA flower does not consist only of what we see, the obvious and immediate. She [the flower] is first of all what we cannot see, yet in harmony the flower\u2019s two essences reveal to us what our eyes can distinguish. This duality is something we must acknowledge, or else we risk being deceived by appearances. The artist who wishes to understand her reality must then re-create, most literally reproduce, its essence. In other words, he must follow her as she grows, from a seed until fully bloomed. A petal\u2019s curve will unlock her secrets to he who has watched her grow. Only he has the right to deform the visible features of objects in order to express his vision, knowing how one aspect affects another and how everything comes into being. He alone is entitled to intervene as creator, by surrendering his will to nature\u2019s workings. He never dreamed of creating a replica of nature\u2019s work and in his eyes the Rose that he portrayed was never anything more than a remarkably convincing likeness.\n\nWhatever the vegetation depicted in Gauguin\u2019s lost 1891 painting might be, it is so lush and dense that it is easy not to notice at center left a walking figure shouldering a pole on which breadfruit, coconuts, or bananas hang. (Indeed, Morice missed the figure entirely in his review of the Durand-Ruel exhibition.) Such verdant growth was strongly aromatic. Odorant, the French word Gauguin chose as his translation of the title of the painting Noa Noa, is vague enough to encompass strong smells: both pleasant (noa noa) and unpleasant (veo veo).\n\nA related watercolor transfer monotype (fig. 13) demonstrates the significance for Gauguin of the setting of Noa Noa, as well as reinforces identification of the locale depicted in the painting. It includes the following motifs, albeit in reverse because of the transfer process: mountain crevasses, mango grove, coconut palms, and spiky foreground plant (in bloom in the monotype). To the composition, Gauguin added a dog and an equestrian, borrowed from two paintings (cat. 51, figs. 51.5 and 51.10). But, most importantly, he included an image of his home\u2014a low, rectangular dwelling with a high, thatched roof (see fig. 14). The setting also appears in an 1894 wood-block print, Oviri (Savage) (fig. 15 [Kornfeld 35]). In addition to the print\u2019s image of the spirit, one sees a coconut palm, a flowering caperbush, and the spiky blades of what might be a peacock plant, all depicted summarily because of the constraints of the woodcut technique. If one flips the print (fig. 16) and superimposes an image of Gauguin\u2019s sculpture Oviri (Savage) (Gray 130) over the painting Noa Noa (fig. 17), the close relationship of the settings of both works becomes evident.\n\nThat one finds so many references to the place where the artist settled demonstrates the methodology (which can be called \u201cGauguin quoting Gauguin\u201d) that the artist used throughout these years and that will be explored in the following analyses of the Noa Noa plates. This also suggests the importance of the setting in his imagination and for his creative process. Gauguin\u2019s images of this scented site capture the vivid palette of the exotic locale and also conjure its pungent smells. It is no wonder that he chose to call his travel account and the images he intended to juxtapose with his written text Noa Noa.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">Anywhere out of the world. . . .\n\nPaul Gauguin, a reader of Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe, chose a place very far from Paris for the extended stay that he planned at the beginning of the last decade of the nineteenth century. Before his departure, a banquet was given in his honor on March 23, 1891. The writer and critic Charles Morice read a poem, in which he addressed the painter in a prophetic tone: \u201cIn an over-there of nature and freedom, / . . . your dream, here half-faded, will be able / To bloom profusely for your glory and our joy.\u201d St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, leader of the Symbolist school of poetry, of whom Gauguin had etched a portrait featuring an image of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s raven (fig. 18 [cat. 26] [Kornfeld 12]), asked the guests to \u201cadmire this superb consciousness, which, in all the splendor of his talent, takes him into exile, setting out, in order to regain strength, toward the furthest distances and toward himself.\u201d\n\nExile, rejuvenation, and self-searching: Gauguin\u2019s exotic destination was not totally unexpected. The artist had spent his early childhood in Peru, he had traveled the world as a sailor, he had painted tropical nature in Martinique, and he had already shunned Parisian subject matter in favor of what he saw as the uncouth, \u201csuperstitious\u201d world of rural Roman Catholic Brittany. The Exposition Universelle of 1889, while celebrating the centenary of the French Revolution, had extolled the beauties of European overseas possessions and the opportunities they offered, including in Tahiti, which had been dubbed the \u201cNew Cythera\u201d in the eighteenth century and had been a French colony since 1880. Gauguin, who was also looking for an inexpensive place to live and work, managed to be charged by the government with an official mission to \u201cstudy the usages and landscapes of this country, from the point of view of art and of the pictures that might be made of it.\u201d Exoticism was intended to contribute to the novelty and interest of the works that he planned to bring back from his trip. But he was also looking for a way of life, a Weltanschauung, and forms of art that would more closely approximate the origins and\u2014from his primitivist point of view\u2014the essence of humankind. He explained to the journalist Jules Huret that he was leaving France for Tahiti so as \u201cto see no one but savages, to live their life, with no other thought in mind but to render, the way a child would, the concepts formed in my brain, and to do this with the aid of nothing but the primitive means of art, the only means that are good and true.\u201d\n\nLeaving the Paris art world for two years was nonetheless an audacious enterprise, which put at risk the reputation Gauguin had slowly built for himself. The artist\u2019s recognition had culminated in being hailed publicly by the art critic Albert Aurier as the representative of \u201cSymbolism in painting,\u201d to the dismay of the younger artist \u00c9mile Bernard, who had worked with him in Pont-Aven and considered himself a cofounder of \u201cSynthetism.\u201d This happened in the spring of 1891, at the time when Symbolism, a cultural movement born within a literary clique, made headlines in Paris and began to impact theater and the fine arts. Despite some reservations, Gauguin contributed to this success and dissemination, including doing a portrait of the poet Jean Mor\u00e9as (fig. 19 [Rewald 30, Pickvance 52]), who had penned a Symbolist manifesto in 1886. But by the time the artist returned to Paris from Tahiti, on August 30, 1894, Aurier had died, as had Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Furthermore, Bernard had left France for Egypt, and Symbolism had been challenged by the rise of more conservative and formalistic tendencies.\n\nIt was therefore crucial for Gauguin to reestablish his status as a leader of the avant-garde and to convince critics, collectors, and the public of the value and authenticity of the paintings and sculptures he had crafted in the South Pacific. In preparation for the exhibition of these works that took place in Paris in November 1893 at the gallery of Paul Durand-Ruel, he started to write a narration of his two-year stay in Tahiti, taking inspiration from Le mariage de Loti (The Marriage of Loti), an immensely successful autobiographical novel first published in 1879 as Rarahu\u2014idylle polyn\u00e9sienne by Pierre Loti, pseudonym for the naval officer Julien Viaud.\n\nGauguin intended this book to publicize his adventures and to help the public understand his art, as he wrote to his wife, Mette, in the fall. Yet his attitude toward understanding and explaining was deeply ambivalent. He had written to Bernard in 1889 that he intended to become \u201cever more incomprehensible,\u201d and to Mette in 1892 that many of his Tahitian pictures would be \u201cincomprehensible\u201d for critics and that she would enjoy their puzzlement. In 1901 he would further argue that in painting, as in music, one should \u201cseek suggestion more than description,\u201d and that if some people reproached him with being incomprehensible, it was because they \u201cwere looking in his pictures for an explanatory side that did not exist.\u201d This ideal of \u201csuggestion\u201d corresponded exactly to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s definition of poetry, while Gauguin associated prose with the tasks of description and explanation. His attitude toward professional writers, moreover, was influenced by the power that art critics, trained as journalists or authors of fiction, came to exert upon the visual arts when the French state\u2013governed system of exhibitions and rewards gave way to a free market of aesthetic and commercial values. In a later \u201cpiece of counter-criticism\u201d ironically entitled Racontars de rapin (A Dauber\u2019s Gossip), he denounced this power as \u201ca typesetter\u2019s theocracy,\u201d but did so by resorting to his nemesis\u2019s instrument, the pen.\n\nGauguin had started writing short pieces of criticism and art theory in 1889 for Le moderniste illustr\u00e9, a short-lived journal edited by Aurier. Commenting upon the Exposition Universelle in his first article, he had defended the value of decoration, praising the architectural fragments from Achaemenid Persia recently acquired by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris (see fig. 20), and formulated the principle of truth to materials: the decoration of buildings, the design and modeling of pottery, he wrote, ought to be done \u201cin harmony with the materials.\u201d Against the tradition of ut pictura poesis, of painting understood as analogous to the written word, and often subservient to it, Gauguin defended the specificity of art as a mode of communication, as a language distinct from the verbal one, a \u201clanguage of the listening eye,\u201d as he would come to phrase it.\n\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, Gauguin produced few illustrations, a type of image traditionally regarded as dependent upon, and auxiliary to, the text being illustrated. An exception such as Madame la Mort (Madame Death) (fig. 21) dates from 1891, the culminating point of Gauguin\u2019s association with Symbolism, which prompted the critic F\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on to describe the artist\u2014much to his displeasure, no doubt\u2014as having become \u201cthe prey of the litt\u00e9rateurs.\u201d Gauguin was far from alone in claiming a status of equality and autonomy for the visual arts, and in searching for ways to engage with texts that would respect and even enhance this status. Odilon Redon, an older artist whom Gauguin respected deeply, had redefined illustration as the subjective \u201cinterpretation\u201d of a text (see fig. 22), while Maurice Denis, a member of the younger generation of artists inspired by Gauguin, suggested in 1890 that one should treat illustration as \u201cthe decoration of a book,\u201d providing no exact correspondence of subject matter with the text, but \u201can embroidery of arabesques upon the pages, an accompaniment of expressive lines\u201d (see fig. 23). A year earlier, Gauguin had similarly doubted that an artist could ever illustrate a book: \u201cHe can decorate the book, yes, add other sensations that relate to it.\u201d\n\nSuch a \u201cdecoration\u201d is found in the manuscript of Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion), a compilation of passages from Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 account Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an that Gauguin copied and illuminated in Tahiti in 1892/93 (fig. 24). Thus Gauguin to some extent could embrace the \u201cillustrating\u201d of his own writing, but what were the requirements for pictures intended to accompany a text meant to help understand other pictures? Gauguin\u2019s draft manuscript of Noa Noa, now in the collection of the Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles, contains four simple sketches, two of which visualize analogies mentioned in the text. One of them compares the summit of Mount Rotui, on the neighboring island of Moorea, to a medieval helmet; the other (fig. 25) comments on the \u201csculptural form\u201d (i.e., the anatomy) of the Tahitians, comparing their arms to columns and their breasts to eyes. But Gauguin envisioned pictures that would be less diagrammatic than these sketches and that would convey an impression of his paintings and sculptures, in reduced and portable form. On the occasion of an exhibition organized with a group of his followers at the Caf\u00e9 des Arts, close to the entrance of the Exposition Universelle, Gauguin had published in 1889 a portfolio of eleven prints, known as the Volpini Suite (cats. 11\u201322), after the name of the owner of the establishment. These impressions, printed in black or reddish-brown ink on large sheets of yellow paper (see fig. 26 [cat. 20]) and collected in a ready-made portfolio (fig. 27 [cat. 11.1]), constituted a compendium of his recent work\u2014mostly based on painted compositions\u2014in Martinique and Brittany.\n\nFor the Volpini Suite, Gauguin had resorted to zincography, a printmaking technique in which a zinc plate, instead of the lithographic stone, served as the matrix, and which was used primarily for commercial purposes. For what is now called the Noa Noa Suite, he chose instead wood-block printing, a technique that he had never used but that was related to his predilection for wood as a material in sculpture, including in reliefs such as the 1890 Soyez myst\u00e9rieuses (Be Mysterious) (fig. 28 [Gray 87]). Being compatible with typography, wood-block printing was revived in the early nineteenth century to sustain the growth in illustrated books and periodicals. In 1819 William Blake had been commissioned to illustrate an English version of Virgil\u2019s first eclogue and produced mysterious nocturnal images (see fig. 29), delineating his figures with white lines against the black ground of the block. In order to achieve a greater precision and efficiency, including in the reproduction of works of art and photographs, wood engravers privileged the use of end-grain boxwood, cut perpendicularly to the direction of the fibers, which offered a hard and homogeneous substance into which the finest lines could be incised with the help of burins, in a way analogous to the metal matrices of intaglio printmaking. Since boxwood only came in small dimensions, a method of assembling large blocks by bolting together smaller ones was invented around 1860, allowing also for a greater division of labor (see fig. 30). In the course of the century, however, wood-block printing faced a growing competition from photomechanical processes as a means of illustration and reproduction, and the very flexibility and virtuosity developed by its practitioners seemed to deny it a raison d\u2019\u00eatre. But following the examples of etching and lithography, it was reinvented as gravure originale, the making of prints as works of art, engraved by the artists themselves, defined as peintres-graveurs, rather than after their designs, and published in limited editions. Several artists belonging to Gauguin\u2019s circle participated in this movement, especially Bernard, who imitated late medieval and popular prints, thought of creating a periodical to promote the woodcut, and antedated some of his works to enhance the precociousness of his contribution (see fig. 31). From 1891 onward, F\u00e9lix Vallotton produced strikingly modern prints, emphasizing the opposition between black-and-white areas and exploiting the simplification of forms to foster decorative flatness and semantic ambiguity (see fig. 32). An additional reason for the popularity of the wood-block print was the widespread admiration for ukiyo-e prints (see fig. 33), which was part of the phenomenon of Japanism (the rage for all things Japanese), in which Gauguin enthusiastically participated.\n\nSuch artists\u2014and their burgeoning market\u2014valued above all authenticity, which they found in the primitive, the autographic, and \u201ctruth to materials.\u201d Consequently, they embraced the technique of early and popular woodcuts and tended to carve with a knife blocks of sidegrain wood, the structure of which encouraged abstraction, coarseness, and na\u00efvet\u00e9. During his second stay in Tahiti, Gauguin would come closer to this tendency, and, partly for lack of access to ready-made matrices, produce his own irregular wood blocks out of the branches or trunks of indigenous trees (see Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints [cats. 91\u2013105]). However, in Paris at a time when inheritance from an uncle afforded him the necessary means, the artist purchased ten (or more) identical mortised wood blocks for the Noa Noa Suite of the kind used by professional wood engravers, perhaps because he wanted to avoid what Richard Field called \u201cthe oversimplification and lack of suggestiveness of Bernard, Pissarro, Vallotton, Rivi\u00e8re and a handful of others already involved in reviving the woodcut as an expressive medium.\u201d Yet he did not treat these blocks as a wood engraver would have done, but instead combined the use of tools normally employed separately, some of them for end-grain matrices, others for side-grain matrices or wood carving in general, and yet others for lithographic stones, after examples by Redon (see fig. 22) and Eug\u00e8ne Carri\u00e8re (see fig. 34). The resulting works thus fit neither technically nor aesthetically into a predetermined category.\n\nUnfortunately, Gauguin\u2019s project of a publication including the Noa Noa text and images did not come to fruition, so that we do not know the exact form he had envisioned for it. The large format of the wood blocks he chose and the complex printing process he developed suggest either a deluxe edition, aimed at a bibliophilic public, or a portolio of prints associated with the printed text. The first possibility could have been inspired by the 1875 edition of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s translation into French of Poe\u2019s The Raven illustrated by Manet (see fig. 35), a supremely elegant and original in-folio publication that had been a commercial failure but a critical success. The inclusion of a raven in Gauguin\u2019s portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 (fig. 18) bears witness to his admiration for this early livre d\u2019artiste, and he also showed how dear Manet\u2019s images for Le corbeau were to him when he wrote in 1888 to Bernard that shadows should be avoided as \u201ctrompe-l\u2019oeil of the sun\u201d but were welcome when they provided the artist with a \u201cnecessary shape\u201d: \u201cIf for instance, instead of a figure, you only put the shadow of a character, it is an original starting-point, the strangeness of which you have calculated. Thus the raven on top of the head of Pallas which is there rather than a parrot because of the artist\u2019s choice, a calculated choice.\u201d This was an allusion to the fourth and last \u201cillustration\u201d by Manet (fig. 36), a striking composition in which an empty chair\u2014instead of a depiction of the narrator in his armchair, as called for by the text\u2014faces the raven sitting atop a bust of Pallas Athena above the chamber door, reduced to a calligraphic shadow. It is no surprise that this masterpiece of abstraction and allusion caught Gauguin\u2019s attention. The Romantic critic Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye, reviewing Le corbeau on its publication in the New York Tribune, had praised Manet in terms that could easily be adapted to the Noa Noa suite: \u201cM. Manet has endeavored to reproduce the vague, the profound, the nocturnal, and the luminous to be found in that admirable poetry, which embraces so much of the ideal and suggestive.\u201d\n\nLike Manet\u2019s zincographs, Gauguin\u2019s prints would not have cohabited with the text on the same pages, but would have been inserted at chosen points, such as the beginning of chapters. Or they could have been mounted on a stronger paper, such as the blue support used for the set of the Noa Noa Suite belonging to Edgar Degas and for the portfolio of new impressions printed in 1921 by Pola Gauguin, the artist\u2019s and Mette\u2019s youngest child (fig. 37). In the latter case, the text could have been printed on sheets of the same size as the mounts or in a smaller format, as a brochure, and could have been included in the portfolio together with the prints. Portfolios were a popular type of publication with the peintres-graveurs and their supporters, like Andr\u00e9 Marty, who from 1893 to 1895 published nine installments of L\u2019estampe originale (see fig. 38), the sixth of which, published in 1894, included a zincographic version of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (see fig. 60.4).\n\nGauguin appears to have worked on all wood blocks simultaneously, from December 1893 to March 1894, letting the images define themselves through a series of stages. Although he derived several of them, more or less directly, from existing compositions, his working process suggests a gradual, and partly improvised, discovery of form and effects. He probably started with a fine needle, comparable to that used for etching, and employed it to define the outlines of the composition, to create subtle textures with networks of lines, and at times to suggest three-dimensionality, as in the body of the seated figure in Auti te pape (Women at the River) (fig. 39 [cat. 59.5]). He also used a gouge, a chisel, and possibly a knife to carve out the areas meant to be white, all the while taking a sculptor\u2019s interest in the small cavities and crests formed by his instruments, as more generally in the block as an object. After examining the provisional results on trial proofs, mostly printed on pink paper (see fig. 40), and discovering that his fine lines and subtle tonal effects tended to be covered by the ink, he used an engraver\u2019s burin to reinforce certain lines, broadening and deepening them, and to emphasize compositional elements.\n\nThe end-grain wood blocks that Gauguin selected came coated with a gray ground and did not possess the surface patterns and variations in hardness capable of informing the creation of the image and of appearing on the impression itself, as would be the case in later woodcuts by Edvard Munch (see fig. 41). Nonetheless, his handling of the blocks is consistent with the aesthetics of medium-specificity he had laid out in his article for Le moderniste illustr\u00e9: the design does not appear to have been imposed upon inert matter but to have emerged \u201cin harmony with the materials.\u201d This is emphasized by an inversion of what had become the customary relationship between black-and-white areas: drawing at first with the needle, Gauguin privileged the \u201cwhite line,\u201d like William Blake (see fig. 29), and turned the untouched surface of the block into the \u201cground\u201d of his pictures, on or out of which the figures appear more or less distinctly.\n\nAs a result, the prints are very dark and create the atmosphere of night, \u201cphosphorescence,\u201d and mystery that is their hallmark. Gauguin was attracted by dualisms and polarities, and, even though he introduced color into his impressions\u2014some of which has faded under the effect of light\u2014he associated the chiaroscuro typical of the graphic arts with the Polynesian opposition between ao, the diurnal part of the day, the domain of humans and material things, and p\u014d, its nocturnal part, the domain of spirits, gods, and the souls of the dead. Three of the prints, Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57), and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60), are explicitly devoted to the latter.\n\nThis effect is strongly reinforced by the unorthodox ways in which Gauguin printed his blocks. Instead of trying to transmit to the paper all the visual information he had deposited into the block, he neglected or avoided\u2014and thereby concealed\u2014a large part of this information and included additional elements by wiping parts of the block and coloring his papers. He also produced visual \u201cnoise\u201d and the suggestion of animation by printing off-register, adding ingredients in his printing ink, and courting chance in numerous and unexpected ways. The textural effects he created are evocative of the eroded and obscured surfaces of ruins in a tropical setting, an appearance he also pursued in contemporary ceramics such as Oviri (fig. 42 [Gray 113]) and a self-portrait as \u201cMask of a Savage\u201d (fig. 43 [Gray 109]), both from 1894. Despite Gauguin\u2019s \u201cexplanatory\u201d intention, his mode of printing does not convey the specificities of place and time, of individual plants, animals, and persons\u2014which a close examination of his studies and sources can help to identify (see Descriptive Analyses and Related Works for cats. 51\u201360)\u2014but enhances the generic, the vague, and the indeterminate. The distance separating the image contained in the matrix and the images actualized in his impressions can be measured by comparing them (see fig. 44 [cat. 59]) to the edition printed by Pola Gauguin in 1921 (see fig. 39). Pola successively used two ink rollers, one soft enough to reach the depths, after which he pulled a waste impression to eliminate the excessive ink on the surface, and a hard roller, so as to avoid filling in superficial cuts, after which he pulled the print. His impressions leave out nothing from the incisions made in the blocks; neither do they add anything to them. Their documentary value is considerable, but it is safe to assume that Gauguin would have dismissed them as descriptive and lacking in suggestion.\n\nAnother original feature of Gauguin\u2019s printing technique is the way in which he inked and printed the parts carved into the block, which would not normally have appeared on the impression but provided him, since he pushed the paper into their cavities, with partly accidental textures and lights, as in the area surrounding the seated woman in Auti te pape (fig. 44). This very artisanal mode of printing heightened the three-dimensionality of the impression\u2014its embossed and tactile quality\u2014which gets lost in reproductions (unless photographed in raking light), but was clearly important to Gauguin. Indeed, he preserved a proof of Te atua (The God) in which only the ink left from a previous impression was used (fig. 45). It resembles the rubbing of reliefs or the paper squeeze-molds that French and English explorers and archaeologists were taking from monuments in the Middle East and the Americas (see fig. 46). Gauguin himself made rubbings of Oceanic motifs from wooden objects carved in low relief typical of the Marquesas Islands (see fig. 47). After his death several of his wooden sculptures, inspired in part by Marquesan art, were used to produce semblances of prints by rubbing (see fig. 48), notably by his friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid for Gauguin\u2019s collector Gustave Fayet. At the same time as Gauguin\u2019s printing method emphasized the physicality of the print, it paradoxically created an aura of otherworldliness, as in the contemporary \u201cphotographs of the invisible\u201d in which ghosts or spirits, dreams, \u201cfluids,\u201d and even thought itself were supposedly revealed, generally as lights on a dark ground (see fig. 49). Whereas the zincographs of the Volpini Suite had been printed on large sheets of yellow paper (see fig. 26), which served as their own mounts, Gauguin trimmed his impressions of the Noa Noa Suite very close to the block, probably because they were meant to be mounted on thicker paper. He may also have been inspired by early prints, which, from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century, tended to be trimmed in this way, and by the example of James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who rejected both the use of large etching plates and artists\u2019 \u201cremarks\u201d sketched on their wide margins as emanating from the \u201cfoolish facility\u201d of amateur engravers and from collectors \u201ctaking curious pleasure in the quantity of paper.\u201d Whistler had also innovatively used wiping for tonal effects and delighted in turning each of his impressions into an individual work of art. So did Gauguin, even though his prints did not yet attract collectors treasuring the \u00e9preuve rare, or unique impression, this oxymoron typical of the market for the gravure originale.\n\nGauguin may have been carried away by his love of experimentation, achieving results that were impossible to replicate and thus to produce in any quantity. Since he was planning an edition, he enlisted the artist Louis Roy, who had participated in the Volpini exhibition and of whom he made a portrait (fig. 50), to assist him with a proper edition. Together they devised a modus operandi, which Roy followed for pulling some twenty-five or thirty impressions of each block, reducing the tonal and chromatic complexities of Gauguin\u2019s impressions with the help of stencil and bright colors (see fig. 51). The result came closer to the aesthetics of Vallotton\u2019s woodcuts or of the chromolithographic posters (see fig. 52) that were then in vogue and regarded by some as the advent of a truly democratic art. We do not know how satisfied Gauguin was with these impressions; the fact that he fragmented some of them to print his later woodcuts on their verso seems to suggest that he did not hold them in high regard. But he experimented in other ways with double-sided works on paper and appears at least in one case to have chosen carefully the cropping of a Roy impression and the resulting disposition, printing the two impressions of Oviri that he gave to Mallarm\u00e9 (fig. 53 [Kornfeld 35]) on two fragments of Mahna no varua ino, placed head to tail and each containing as its central motif a supernatural bonfire (fig. 54 [Kornfeld 19]).\n\nFor his text also, Gauguin enlisted a collaborator, selecting Charles Morice, who had gained a reputation as a spokesman for Symbolism with a book-length essay published in 1889, La litt\u00e9rature de tout \u00e0 l\u2019heure. In 1891 Morice had helped to organize a benefit performance for Gauguin and Paul Verlaine, and the artist had expressed his appreciation with a warm dedication on an impression of his Portrait of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (fig. 55 [Kornfeld 12]). Regarding Noa Noa, Gauguin may have wished the assistance of a professional, or he may have intended from the start, as he would claim in 1902, to juxtapose his prose and Morice\u2019s contribution so as to contrast the voice of \u201cthe na\u00efve and brutal savage\u201d\u2014which he impersonated\u2014with that of \u201cthe rotten civilized.\u201d In any event, for reasons partly arising from Morice\u2019s procrastinating habits and chronic impecuniosity, this collaboration led to delays in the publication, a separation of the Noa Noa Suite from the text it was supposed to accompany, a multiplication of the versions of this text, and a deterioration of the relationship between the two men. At some point in the process, Gauguin may also have contemplated an edition illustrated by drawings reproduced photomechanically (see cats. 61\u201363).\n\nThe protracted and complex history of Noa Noa cannot be told here. Suffice it to say that three main versions of the text exist: the already mentioned draft at the Getty; a second manuscript in Gauguin\u2019s hand, subtitled Voyage de Tahiti, preserved at the Louvre; and the printed edition published in 1901 by Morice at the \u00c9ditions de La Plume, Paris. After lending to Morice the Getty draft, as well as the one of Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (1892\u201393; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, held by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris), Gauguin used the Louvre draft\u2014which he took to Tahiti in 1895 and to the Marquesas in 1901\u2014for a revised version of the text with his own additions and the ones (mainly an introduction and poems) that he obtained from Morice. He also enriched this manuscript with watercolors, fragments of his prints, rubbings (see fig. 47), and photographs of works by himself and others (see fig. 56), finally concluding it with a new text entitled Diverses choses (Various Things) (1896\u201397; Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris). The publication of the three versions took place in reverse order, with the Louvre\u2019s being reproduced in 1924 and the Getty\u2019s appearing in print in 1954. This led to condemnations of Morice\u2019s interventions as a \u201ccorruption\u201d of the artist\u2019s project, but Nicholas Wadley suggested that \u201cthe final form published in 1901 more or less corresponds to Gauguin\u2019s first intention,\u201d while Linda Goddard argued in favor of the Louvre\u2019s manuscript.\n\nA major source of the Noa Noa prints is to be found in the paintings and sculptures created by Gauguin during his first stay in Tahiti, as Peter Zegers indicates in his Descriptive Analyses and Related Works for the plates. The relationship varies from case to case but consists mainly of variations and combinations of motifs, to which new inventions were freely added. Other works, especially watercolor monotypes and counterproofs, played several roles in this process, including that of intermediary between painting and print. A close examination of this relationship has shown that the outline of some figures, such as the sitting woman in Auti te pape (Women at the River) (fig. 39, fig. 44, and fig. 51), corresponds exactly to their equivalent in the painted prototype (fig. 57 [W 461]), which suggests that Gauguin used a mechanical tool\u2014a camera lucida, perspectival frame, photographic camera, or plate of glass put on a movable easel\u2014to operate the transfer and the change of scale (see cat. 67). Gauguin may have worked, as Zegers suggests, in the middle of his studio on the rue Vercing\u00e9torix, Paris, with his Tahitian works surrounding him, in a panoptic situation that enabled him to use his work of the past two years as a sort of archive, from which he could select, modify, and assemble elements at will. But we should remember that he placed memory and imagination above imitation, having advised \u00c9mile Schuffenecker to create art by \u201cdreaming in front of\u201d nature, rather than \u201ccopy[ing] too closely from nature\u201d: this is an instruction that he certainly took to heart when dealing with his own work.\n\nZegers also points to other sources that inform these prints, some of them new and some already present in painted and sculpted form. These cover a broad range of cultural references, from classical and Far Eastern antiquity to Western art (from the Renaissance to the present) and to the arts of Asia and Oceania. Rather than keeping them separate, Gauguin joined these sources in ways that may appear arbitrary but were meaningful to him (see fig. 56). His eclecticism corresponded to the age of universal expositions, European colonialism, and the collecting and display of art and artifacts from an ever-expanding range of places, cultures, and periods. His syncretism derived not only from an insufficient awareness of the specificity of diverse cultures, but also from the assumption of a shared, universal language underlying them. For Gauguin universalism had a metaphysical dimension, as his allusions to a world religion indicate. When combining Oceanic with Southeast Asian and Indian prototypes, moreover, he followed current diffusionist ideas about the origins of Polynesian culture. The legitimacy of his \u201cborrowings\u201d and \u201cappropriations\u201d has sometimes been questioned from a postcolonial point of view, but he took seriously, as art, objects that had often been collected as trophies of Christian conversion and were mostly studied as ethnographic documents. In fact, resorting to the very materials and forms of the \u201cidols\u201d previously condemned by the missionaries constituted for the artist a provocative reversal of the process of westernization.\n\nShigemi Inaga proposed defining Gauguin\u2019s combining and blending of sources as a \u201ccreolization of visual language,\u201d arguing that the process implied a \u201csyntactic transformation and lexical decontextualization,\u201d and resulted in a greater linguistic complexity and autonomy than those of pidgin, characterized by hybridization and syncretism. He also suggested that the artist was both \u201can ultimate product of the colonial situation\u201d and \u201can unusual precursor of the search for multicultural identity.\u201d Indeed, given Gauguin\u2019s later transgressive references to cannibalism, it is tempting to regard his omnivorous incorporation of models from all origins as an early form of \u201canthropophagy,\u201d in the cultural sense coined a generation later by the Brazilian modernists. While possessing an anticolonial dimension, Oswald de Andrade\u2019s \u201cCannibalist Manifesto\u201d defined anthropophagy as universal, \u201cthe world\u2019s single law.\u201d In effect, the paintings of his artist friends, especially those of Tarsila do Amaral (see fig. 58), show that they had cannibalized Gauguin in his turn.\n\nGauguin\u2019s openness toward artifacts regarded as \u201cprimitive\u201d is also related to the defense of \u201cdecorative\u201d art that he had voiced in 1889: in the wake of the first universal exposition, the 1851 Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations in London, the British reformers of design had already praised non-Western ornament, including Oceanic, as embodying universal laws of composition and providing an antidote to the rampant naturalism of industrialized decoration. Owen Jones\u2019s 1856 The Grammar of Ornament formulated such laws and made available a world compendium of decorative motifs in chromolithographic form (see fig. 59). In Polynesia Gauguin depended on reproductions of the works dear to him, as well as on drawings and prints. While gathering them, in 1890, he spoke of \u201ca whole small world of comrades who will chat with me every day,\u201d and indeed he never tired of studying and quoting from them. In a brilliant public exchange in 1895 with the playwright and painter August Strindberg, in which he would also pit the \u201csavage\u201d against the \u201ccivilized,\u201d Gauguin contrasted the \u201clanguages of Oceania\u201d with the modern \u201cinflected languages\u201d: the former left their \u201cessential elements preserved\u201d and visible, as in an early mosaic, whereas the latter resembled a \u201clapidary painting,\u201d in which \u201conly the expert eye can unmask the process of construction.\u201d The role he gave himself in the collaborative Noa Noa was that of le conteur, the teller of tales, and orality was important to him both as a theme and as a mode of dissemination. During his first stay in Polynesia, he had given Tahitian titles to his paintings, and he did the same for all the prints of the Noa Noa Suite with one exception, L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54). This linguistic choice added to the \u201cincomprehensibility\u201d of the works and greatly annoyed the majority of his critics. The adjective no\u2019ano\u2019a, as he explained, means \u201cfragrant\u201d and is employed repeatedly in the text in reference to Tahiti. Gauguin may have been seduced by its iterative character, which corresponds well to the repetitive process at the heart of the series of prints, and which he emphasized by spelling it in two words: noa noa. It creates an interior rhyme as well as alliteration, and Gauguin condensed in it the sensory experience that he equated with Tahiti. The fact that he chose the sense of smell, rather than sight, points toward synesthesia, a phenomenon of great interest to the Symbolists, and is coherent with his primitivism, to the extent that smell, while contributing to rememoration in a particularly vivid way, was associated with archaic and unconscious stages of development. (For more on the meaning of noa noa, see Scented Sites).\n\nThe degree to which Gauguin understood and mastered Tahitian, however, has been an object of controversy: various authors, most prominently the anthropologist Bengt Danielsson, judged his command of the language limited and faulty, while a Tahitian scholar, Hiriata Millaud, found that it has been underestimated. According to her, Gauguin employed unusual spellings because of the context of orality in which he lived, and he played consciously with the ambiguity of his titles and of his own translations of them. Auti te pape (fig. 39, fig. 44, and fig. 51), for instance, is composed of te pape, meaning \u201cthe fresh water\u201d or \u201cthe river,\u201d and ha\u2019uti, which as a verb means \u201cplay and \u201cmove,\u201d and as an adjective, \u201cturbulent.\u201d Danielsson noted that, in the absence of a linking particle (other than the article te), it is \u201cimpossible to know with certitude which word is the subject and which the direct object,\u201d so that the title could be translated either as \u201cthe fresh water is in motion\u201d or as \u201cplaying in the fresh water.\u201d But this uncertainty regarding the subject of the action\u2014whether the plunging bather or the water itself\u2014is crucial to the print, in which strange reflections in the upper right corner suggest the apparition of faces or masks, more clearly than had been the case in the Volpini The Laundresses (fig. 26) (see cat. 59, Commentary).\n\nThe importance that Gauguin attached to his titles is obvious from the fact that he inscribed them on paintings and wood blocks, thereby compelling viewers to read these mysterious words as they scrutinize the equally mysterious images. Marcel Duchamp later compared titles to \u201cinvisible colors,\u201d subtly informing the visual perception of the works to which they are attached. Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian titles do this poetically, making sound precede and suggest meaning. This is similar to what the Symbolist poets did, prompting the antimodern critic Max Nordau to equate their poetry with the pathological phenomenon of echolalia in his 1892 pamphlet Degeneration. The short words of the Tahitian language, rich in vowels and repetitions, lent themselves to a comparison with the babble of children, and a positively minded critic commented: \u201cChildish and charming words sing at the bottom of these canvases.\u201d For Gauguin too this reference was entirely positive: he would famously write that he had taken his art \u201cfurther back than the horses on the Parthenon\u201d to the dada\u2014another iterative word\u2014the wooden hobby horse of his childhood.\n\nWhile the motifs in the prints of the Noa Noa Suite derive in good part from Gauguin\u2019s paintings and sculptures of the first Tahitian stay, their relation to the Noa Noa text is less close, except when the description of a corresponding painting is introduced in or was planned for the manuscript. Moreover, while Gauguin carved titles into the wood blocks, he avoided any mention of order, such as numbers, and did not give any other indication to that effect. As a result, the question of the succession he may have intended has been abundantly debated, and several hypotheses have been advanced. Richard Field, who saw in the series an \u201callegory of human existence\u201d clothed in a reconstruction of the Tahitian past, suggested that it unfolds like an \u201celemental life cycle\u201d comprising birth and death, maturation and sexual consciousness, loving and procreation, food gathering, bathing, society and ritual, sleep and dreams, and religion. Calvin Brown recently attempted to connect the ten prints with the equal number of chapters composing the draft manuscript of Noa Noa: in the resulting sequence, the eponymous print, which is composed like a title page, is followed by three horizontal \u201cviews of Tahitian life\u201d (Auti te pape, Te po, and Mahna no varua ino), after which the vertical Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) introduces four horizontal \u201cviews derived from Tahitian myth\u201d: Te atua, Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55), L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, Manao tupapau, and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58).\n\nThe order of the prints in the present catalogue follows the one proposed in 1995 by Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers, who saw the series as \u201ca rich and highly inventive mythic vision that can be read as unfolding in narrative sequence.\u201d This sequence begins with Noa Noa, which depicts a daytime scene of food gathering and is clearly composed as a title piece, and continues with the nocturnal Te po, because of the presence of the artist\u2019s monogram in the upper left corner and of his own representation as witness and raconteur among the figures of the scene. The other prints therefore represent Gauguin\u2019s \u201ctale,\u201d starting with the evocation of the gods in Te atua, the (re)creation of the world in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, and the gratitude toward the gods expressed by humankind in Maruru. Evil enters the Tahitian paradise with Nave nave fenua, and an \u201cevil spirit\u201d presides over the traditional dance \u2018upa \u2018upa in Mahna no varua ino. The \u201cevil spirit\u201d reappears discreetly above the love-making couple of Te faruru and, in Auti te pape, a solitary woman turns her back on the pleasure of bathing. The \u201cfallen world\u201d is symbolized by Manao tupapau, which returns to the realm of the night and the supernatural introduced by Te po, and where the crouching figure unites the poses of birth, sleep, and death.\n\nBrown\u2019s order corresponds to the movement of Gauguin\u2019s narration, which moves away from westernized Papeete toward the interior of the island and a deeper understanding of its inhabitants and their ancient culture, whereas Druick and Zegers\u2019s sequence suggests a historical development, from the Polynesian theo- and cosmogenesis to a \u201cfall\u201d in which the arrival of Christianity clearly plays a role. Other authors, however, have been sceptical about the possibility and desirability of defining any such arrangement. In 1988 Richard Brettell concluded from his examination of the prints that it was \u201cmore than likely that there was no prescribed narrative sequence intended by Gauguin,\u201d observing that the artist\u2019s \u201cmental habits were far from methodical,\u201d that he \u201ctended to avoid any closed order,\u201d and that the text for Noa Noa itself \u201cwas conceived as an open series of scenes or tales, many of which assumed different places in the whole as the manuscript progressed.\u201d A similar view was proposed recently by Elizabeth Prelinger for the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (see Introduction to Suite of Late Wood-Blocks and Prints [cats. 91\u2013105]), which she compared to a myriorama, an early nineteenth-century popular pastime in which cards could be laid out in any order to create multiple panoramic landscapes, as well as to Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s Livre, a project left unfinished at the time of the poet\u2019s death in 1898, and in which the text would have been printed on unbound folios, put in a new order for each reading. Starr Figura since concurred that these prints \u201cseem to invite the viewer to participate in an activity of arranging and rearranging similar to the artist\u2019s own process of repurposing images and motifs,\u201d and evoked a \u201cpre-Freudian game of free association.\u201d\n\nThe Volpini Suite, comprising almost the same number of plates, came in a portfolio (fig. 27) with no definite sequence. It is therefore easy to imagine that the order of the Noa Noa prints could have been left for the viewer to determine and changed with each viewing. The lithographic albums by Redon, which Gauguin studied closely, contained plates that were sometimes numbered and sometimes not, but were never bound, and Redon made it a point to keep them independent from the texts to which they might be related. The empowerment of the recipient, effected by the absence of a fixed order in a series of potentially narrative images, stood high on the Symbolist agenda, as Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s project shows, and corresponded to the ideal of \u201csuggestive\u201d communication on a syntactic level. Gauguin himself compared the loose arrangement of episodes, reflections, and jests in his 1903 Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After) to \u201ca child\u2019s game, images in a kaleidoscope,\u201d and the combinatory process launched by an open sequence of interelated images corresponded closely to his mode of artistic production, which employed figures, attitudes, and scenes as what Sylvie Crussard has called the \u201cletters of a personal alphabet.\u201d From this perspective, the Noa Noa Suite could be seen as a paper monument\u2014in accordance with its allusions to the iconographic cycles of the Buddhist temple compound in Borobudur (see cat. 53, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works) and of the basilica of San Francesco in Assisi (see cat. 52, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works)\u2014but a monument proposing a matrix of meanings, rather than a program in the usual sense.\n\nUsing Brown\u2019s typology, one may distinguish, in the subject matter of the plates, between genre (scenes of everyday life in present-day Tahiti) and myth (deities and the creation of the world according to ancient Tahitian mythology). A distinction of this kind was indeed used by critics in relation to Gauguin\u2019s 1893 exhibition, and yet it is not a satisfactory one. Te atua (fig. 45) offers an image of the Tahitian pantheon\u2014albeit a reduced and idiosyncratic one, valorizing the feminine element and dramatizing the opposition between eternity and mortality. But L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, as the present tense of its title makes clear, does not depict original creation, situated in a mythical past, but natural creation understood as a continuous process, in agreement with the theory of evolution. As for the \u201cscenes of everyday life,\u201d all of them include an element of the supernatural, either in the explicit form of \u201cghosts\u201d (t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u) and \u201cevil spirits\u201d (v\u0101rua \u2018ino), or, suggestively, as intimations of a divine or demonic presence in nature, like the two inchoate faces of Auti te pape (fig. 39, fig. 44, and fig. 51). In Nave nave fenua (fig. 60), the ancient polytheistic religion, implying a genetic continuity between the creator god and deified ancestors, is confronted with Christianity, its dogma of the Fall and its condemnation of sexuality (see cat. 56), and their ambivalent relationship oscillates between conflict and syncretism. The former gods, in any case, have not disappeared, but are relegated to the realm of \u201csuperstition,\u201d so that the menacing presence of a t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u\u2014a word Gauguin translated into French as revenant, \u201cghost\u201d but literally \u201ccoming back\u201d\u2014amounts to a return of the repressed. We know that, despite his claim in Noa Noa to have been initiated into Tahitian lore by his young mistress \u201cTehura,\u201d Gauguin derived his knowledge from the reading of Moerenhout\u2019s book, which he excerpted and illustrated in Ancien culte mahorie (see fig. 24). A few commentators think that he was only able to see in Tahiti what he had been looking for and did little more than repeat current stereotypes\u2014some of them going back to the eighteenth century\u2014of sexually available Polynesian women (vahine), an indolent people living in a paradisiacal nature, and a culture slowly dying from its encounter with western civilization. Such readings, however, seem blind to the complexity and ambiguity of Gauguin\u2019s images of Polynesia, including\u2014and perhaps especially\u2014in the Noa Noa Suite. After describing the disappointment of his first encounter with colonial Tahiti, the narrator of Noa Noa defined his quest as an attempt \u201cto get back to the ancient hearth, revive the fire in the midst of all these ashes\u201d; indeed, the image of a dormant volcano is an implicit but recurring element of his Polynesian iconography. Werner Hofmann considered that Gauguin attempted to reverse the historical course of events and move back \u201cfrom the Christian icon to the pagan idol,\u201d while painting both \u201cParadise and the knowledge of its loss,\u201d and Alastair Wright argued that the \u201cstructure of repetition intrinsinc to printmaking techniques allowed him to reflect on the impossibility of having any authentic experience in his dreamed-of Polynesian idyll.\u201d\n\nFor Gauguin the volcano was a metaphor for creativity, congenial to the volcanic tropical islands of Martinique, Tahiti, and the Marquesas. But his major concerns were continuations of the issues he had tackled in France, especially in Brittany, as some critics noted in 1893. Informed by current research in the psychology of sensation and of dream, Gauguin was exploring the subjectivity of visual perception, illuminating its active and cognitive dimension. In Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 61 [W 245]), he had included a depiction of Jacob wrestling with the angel, which existed, as he wrote to Vincent van Gogh, \u201conly in the imagination of the people praying.\u201d In Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 62 [W 457]), he included a depiction of the \u201cspirit of the dead\u201d and explained, commenting on two possible readings of its Tahitian title, that either the frightened woman thinks about or believes in the ghost, or the ghost watches over her, thereby creating a relation of ontological reversibility between the human and the supernatural. In the xylographic version of Manao tupapau, as printed by Pola Gauguin (fig. 63 [cat. 60.4]), the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u appears in the upper right corner as a sort of diminutive statue, leaning against a post bearing the (almost indistinguishable) facial features of the creator god Ta \u2018aroa. And in the impressions of this print that Gauguin made himself (fig. 64 [cat. 60.2]), the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019u and the post become a discontinuous, ambiguous series of lights piercing the night, so that we do not know whether we perceive or imagine a presence.\n\nThis intentional obfuscation and polysemy are systematic in the Noa Noa Suite, and their effects are discussed here in the interpretive entries. Each impression Gauguin made proposes another version, gives a different reading of the \u201cscore\u201d constituted by the block. The resulting variety and non-repeatability brought uniqueness to the world of multiples and integrated the act of printing itself into the autographic process characteristic of the age of medium-specificity. In this regard, the suite in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago is of particular interest, thanks to the fact that its impressions came from the collection of Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio, a young artist from the Basque country whom Gauguin befriended in 1893 and to whom he gave or entrusted a number of his works two years later, when he returned to Tahiti.\n\nAlthough the publication Gauguin had envisioned never materialized, the prints of the Noa Noa suite soon had a profound impact. He must have had some of the proofs or blocks with him in Pont-Aven in the summer of 1894, when he was immobilized by a broken ankle at the Pension Gloanec. The young writer Alfred Jarry, staying at the same inn, was working on his first book, Les minutes de sable m\u00e9morial. Published in September, it included primitivist woodcuts by the author (see fig. 65), a poem after Gauguin\u2019s 1891 painting Man with an Ax (1891 [W 430], fig. 66), and an introduction that expounded a radical theory of polysemy, urging writers \u201cto suggest instead of saying, to make a crossroad of every word in the sentence-street.\u201d Jarry also participated in the \u201cwoodcut revival\u201d by publishing two luxurious periodicals, L\u2019ymagier, which included a work after Gauguin, The Magdalen, in April 1895 (see Introduction to the Suite of Late Wood-Blocks and Prints [cats.89-103], fig. 1), and Perhind\u00e9rion, which lasted for only two issues. In December 1894, Gauguin organized an exhibition of new work in his studio on the rue Vercing\u00e9torix, hanging the Noa Noa prints on the yellow walls among paintings and curios brought back from Tahiti. This exhibition was reviewed, and the novelty of the prints was not lost on the critics. Morice wrote that Gauguin\u2019s experiments with woodcuts and monotypes would provoke \u201ca revolution in the art of printmaking and of watercolor,\u201d and Julien Leclercq described his prints as \u201cintermediate between sculpture and painting,\u201d adding that they threw light on the link between the two mediums in his art. A set of the prints was purchased by Edgar Degas, whose appreciation was related to his own experiments with monotypes. Artists whom the wood-block prints encouraged to work in the medium include Edvard Munch (see fig. 41), who probably discovered them in 1895 in Paris, and German Expressionists such as Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (see fig. 67), a decade later.\n\nJarry, Munch, and the Expressionists all chose to carve on side-grain wood, however\u2014as stated above, so did Gauguin in his later prints\u2014and the tonal subtlety and mysterious atmosphere of the Noa Noa suite remain unique. For the artist himself, the series was important in several ways. The plates mediated between his works in two and three dimensions, helping to intensify a circulation of motifs and inventions across mediums, and they recapitulated the work he had done so far in Tahiti, creating the basis for an ars combinatoria that would nurture his art until the end of his life. Gauguin always had a taste for experimentation, but there is no doubt that the pleasure he found in manipulating wood blocks, papers, and inks in the search for the perfect image, while impractical and thus fatal for his publishing aim, proved enduringly fruitful in making him discover possibilities of multiplying images in ever new forms. Field spoke of Gauguin\u2019s \u201cresponsiveness to the physical act of making art,\u201d saying that his prints \u201coffer a laboratory to watch the artist at work, revealing all the to-and-fros of hand and mind.\u201d Gauguin himself wrote that a potter needs \u201cintelligent hands,\u201d and while he was in Paris working on his prints, Leclercq took a remarkable photograph of the artist, giving pride of place to his left hand (fig. 68). The image was part of a project documenting the hands and characters of famous men based on the ideas of an occultist physiologist, which explains its resemblance to the \u201cphotography of the invisible\u201d (see fig. 49), but it also beautifully expresses the dynamics at work in the Noa Noa Suite.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The artist misidentified the location of the reliefs as Cambodian rather than Indonesian. In March 1889, he wrote to \u00c9mile Bernard, \u201cIn the Java village there are Hindoo dances. All of the art of India can be seen there, and it is exactly like the photos I have.\u201d Gauguin: Letters to His Wife and Friends, ed. Maurice Malingue, trans. Henry J. Stenning (World, 1949), p. 118, no. 81.\n\nThere are 1,460 narrative reliefs at the temple site. Van Kinsbergen\u2019s suite, Oudheden van Java: De temple ru\u00efne van Boro-Boedoer, was published in Batavia (present-day Jakarta) and was available through subscription only. These Van Kinsbergen photographs (fig. 1 and fig. 2) represent the photographs that Gauguin actually owned and are currently held by the Fabrice Fourmanoir Collection, Papeete, Tahiti. How Gauguin obtained them is a matter of conjecture. See Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers, \u201cLe kampong et la pagoda: Gauguin \u00e0 l\u2019exposition universelle de 1889,\u201d in Gauguin: Actes du colloque Gauguin, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 11\u201313 Janvier 1989 (Documentation Fran\u00e7aise, 1991), pp. 1\u201342. Because Gauguin\u2019s photographs are faded, all other reproductions here of them and of other Van Kinsbergen plates are from the publication Oudheden van Java.\n\n\u201cJe ne suis plus \u00e0 Papeete, mais au district de Mataieu.

Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, given by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, 1927, RF 7259.\n\nThe mango tree was introduced to Tahiti in 1848 by the commander of the French fleet in the Pacific, Rear-Admiral Le Goarant de Tromelin. See Louis Chabouis and Francis Chabouis, Short Flora of Tahiti (Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Oc\u00e9anistes, 1971), p. 23.\n\nResearch by Kristen Hoermann Lister, paintings conservator at the Art Institute of Chicago and a contributor to this volume, led her to suggest that the plant might be a peacock flower (Dietes bicolor). In addition to peacock flower, other English names by which the plant is commonly known are yellow wild iris, African iris, and butterfly iris. The flower is pale yellow, with dark, blotchy markings; it typically measures about six centimeters in diameter. Individual flowers last one day. Significantly, the plant\u2019s flower production can be erratic. Why some peacock plants bloom profusely and others grow luxuriantly but do not produce many flowers is not clear. See George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst, A Tropical Garden Flora: Plants Cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands and Other Tropical Places (Bishop Museum Press, 2005), pp. 669\u201370; and Bernard Hermann and Jean-Claude Celhay, Plants and Flowers of Tahiti (Times/Pacifique, 1986), pp. 108\u201309 (under M. bicolore). However, this identification is made with some reservations. In a letter dated May 9, 2014, Dr. Jean-Yves Meyer, plant ecologist, field botanist, and conservation biologist at the Ministry of Marine Resources, Mines, and Research, Papeete, is quoted as saying that he could not corroborate the presence of the peacock plant in the painting Noa Noa. He suggested that the large clump in the foreground is grass.\n\nThe flower of the caperbush (Capparis spinosa) opens at dusk and lasts only until daylight. See Marius Jacobs, The Genus Capparis (Capparaceae) from the Indus to the Pacific (J. J. Green &amp; Zoon, 1965), pp. 405\u201323; and George W. Staples and Derral R. Herbst, A Tropical Garden Flora: Plants Cultivated in the Hawaiian Islands and Other Tropical Places (Bishop Museum Press, 2005), pp. 219\u201320. In a letter dated May 9, 2014, and an e-mail dated May 2, 2014, Dr. Jean-Yves Meyer noted that the caperbush is not officially recorded as growing in French Polynesia: it has neither been collected nor deposited in herbaria and has not been reported in any databases. The single Capparis native to the region is the Pacific caperbush (C. cordifolia), but it is found only in the Austral Islands (Rapa, Rimatara, Rurutu) and some of the raised limestone atolls in the Tuamotu Archipelago (Makatea). Meyer suggested that Gauguin might have seen a pua veo veo (C. religosa), which the first Polynesians probably introduced to Tahiti but which is now extremely rare there.\n\n\u201cUne fleur ne consiste pas seulement en ce qui on voit d\u2019elle, en son aspect \u00e9vident, imm\u00e9diat: elle est avant tout dans ce que d\u2019elle on ne voit pas, et qui est pourtant dans ce qu\u2019on voit, et qu\u2019il faut conna\u00eetre pour ne pas se laisser induire en erreur par les premi\u00e8res apparences.

On the relationship between the two texts, see Noa Noa; Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti, ed.

Richard Field argued that \u201cthe Suite was really intended to illustrate Noa Noa\u201d because the size of the prints \u201ccorresponds excellently with the format\u201d of the draft at the Getty (Field, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite,\u201d Burlington Magazine 110, no. 786 [Sept. 1968], p. 503), but he stopped short of suggesting that Gauguin thought of reproducing (rather than typesetting) his manuscript, which alone would make this coincidence meaningful; it is improbable, since Gauguin clearly considered his draft at the Getty only a first step.\n\nCalvin Brown observed that this zincograph \u201cmakes clear that if Gauguin had intended to illustrate Noa Noa with fine reproductions of his South Sea paintings, he certainly was capable of doing so\u201d; Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat.

Schniewind, \u201cThe Set of Eleven Large Woodcuts,\u201d undated manuscript on file in the Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago; and Richard S. Field. Field summarized his analysis as follows: \u201cThe development of the Noa Noa Suite just outlined began with two distinct styles of cutting, one subtle, the other bold but capable of refinement in printing. To take impressions from the blocks during their first stages was at times either aesthetically unsatisfying or physically impractical. Consequently a drastic new method of cutting with the gouge was undertaken. It, in turn, threatened the suggestive character of the image. Thereupon, further innovations in inking, printing, and colouring were called upon once more to unite the disparate elements. Finally, with the Roy edition, the duality was sacrificed to the broader form.\u201d Field, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite,\u201d Burlington Magazine 110, no. 786 (Sept. 1968), p. 507.\n\nColta F. Ives thought that Gauguin \u201cattempted to imitate the earliest, most primitive forms of printmaking, probably the schematic incunabula of Japanese woodcuts . . . in which white lines figured on black grounds in imitation of stone rubbings.\u201d Ives, The Great Wave: The Influence of Japanese Woodcuts on French Prints, exh. cat.

Marcel Gu\u00e9rin wrote that Gauguin and Bernard made rubbings from the cupboard they carved together (cat. 9) to keep track of the carvings and supposed that, since the rubbings looked like medieval woodcuts, they may have suggested a later recourse to wood-block printmaking; Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.

In a letter of December 8, 1892, to his wife, Gauguin wrote that his translations were for her only and would give her an advantage over the critics, whereas the catalogue should only print the titles as inscribed on the paintings; Paul Gauguin: Letters to His Wife and Friends, ed. Maurice Malingue, trans. Henry J. Stenning (World, 1949), p. 177, no. 134.

[Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893], pp. 17\u201320). Stephen Eisenman considered that, since the French colonial administration was repressing the use of the native tongue in Tahiti, the choice of these titles on Gauguin\u2019s part was \u201ca purposeful affront to colonial officials\u201d and amounted to \u201ca small but noteworthy example of white resistance to colonial ideology\u201d; Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream, ed.
