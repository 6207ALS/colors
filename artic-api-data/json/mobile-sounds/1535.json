    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: To take us through this work by James McNeill Whistler, we've called on the Art Institute's Sarah Kelly. She starts with the painting's original title, which was simply, &quot;Nocturne: Blue and Gold.&quot;</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY: He chose the word &quot;nocturne&quot; because it has associations with music. He wanted to remove any suggestion that his painting had narrative to it. It's important to notice how flattened this composition is. Instead of suggesting a recession into depth, he instead creates a high horizon line, which tilts the composition upwards in your reading of it, so that there's almost no depth whatsoever. He painted very thinly, and he was actually using very thinned down oil pigment, like a stain, which is why in fact you can often see the canvas showing through so prominently. He would then blur those forms, I think with a rag, so that for example when you see those ships at the upper right-hand corner, you can see how obscured they are. He then went on to add these dots of yellow pigment as a way of punctuating, I would say, the composition.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Whistler's style was boldly original for his time, almost verging on abstraction.</p>\n<p>Sarah Kelly:  And what always amuses me about Whistler is that these were shocking at the time to his audience, they were absolutely shocking. And his paintings would get hung upside down because people didn\u2019t know what to make of them.</p>\n",
