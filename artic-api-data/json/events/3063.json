    "description": "<p>The theme for this month's Intersections is the visibility (and invisibility) of labor. How do artistic representations of labor and manufacturing shape our perception of work and the urban environment? Join museum educators Nenette Luarca-Shoaf and Robin Schnur to discuss these issues, questions partly inspired in part by the special exhibition, <a href=\"/exhibition/who-builds-your-architecture\"><em>Who Builds Your Architecture?</em></a>. The show traces the global networks of people and materials moving around the world, often in uneven and unequal ways, and proposes ethical approaches to future building projects.</p><p>In this new interactive lecture series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Educators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p> </p>",
