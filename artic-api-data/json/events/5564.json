    "description": "<p>Join Melinda Watt, chair and Christa C. Mayer Thurman Curator of Textiles, and Monika Bincsik, curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, as they discuss <a href=\"/exhibitions/9313/fabricating-fashion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fabricating Fashion</em></a> and the strategies Bincsik and Watt have employed for exhibiting clothing and textiles to highlight that fashion in locations around the globe shows mutual interrelationships.</p><p>Textiles are fundamentally important in creating silhouette and aesthetics, the final design is determined by the fabric\u2019s unique qualities. <em>Fabricating Fashion</em> celebrates the many makers of these fabrics\u2014from the professionally trained to the self-taught. In doing so, the exhibition invites us to consider the political, cultural, and social significance of fashion and contemplate what own fabric choices say.</p><h2>About the Speakers</h2><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.
