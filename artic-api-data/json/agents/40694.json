    "description": "<p>Roberto Sebasti\u00e1n Antonio Matta Echaurren, better known simply as Matta, forged a unique path between visionary landscape painting and abstraction, making profound contributions to both the international <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?style_ids=Surrealism\" target=\"_blank\">Surrealist</a> movement and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?style_ids=Abstract+Expressionism\" target=\"_blank\">Abstract Expressionism</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Trained as an architect in Santiago, Chile, Matta moved to France in the mid-1930s and worked as a draftsman in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/31814/le-corbusier-charles-edouard-jeanneret\" target=\"_blank\">Le Corbusier</a>\u2019s architecture studio for several years. The British-American painter Gordon Onslow Ford (for whom the artist would later name his son, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/62107/gordon-matta-clark\" target=\"_blank\">Gordon Matta-Clark</a>) first introduced Matta to Surrealism and encouraged him to pursue painting. Matta\u2019s early works, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118730/untitled-psychological-morphology\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Untitled (Psychological Morphology)</em></a> (1939), modeled a new approach to representing psychological states through landscape-like compositions.</p><p>Fleeing Paris almost immediately after the outbreak of World War II, Matta arrived in New York in November 1939. His fluency in English allowed him to socialize with ease among contemporaries including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35851/robert-motherwell\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Motherwell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/1855/william-baziotes\" target=\"_blank\">William Baziotes</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/20772/jackson-pollock\" target=\"_blank\">Jackson Pollock</a>, who began to meet regularly in Matta\u2019s studio and were inspired by his particularly painterly approach to Surrealist ideas. Matta\u2019s vibrant abstract paintings of the mid-1940s, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117188/the-earth-is-a-man\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Earth Is a Man</em></a><em> </em>(1942)\u2014arguably the artist\u2019s best-known work\u2014led the way to the growing monumental scale of abstraction in New York later that decade.</p><p>In the late 1940s Matta chose to leave New York, working between Italy and his native Chile for much of the rest of his life. He continued to create paintings, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159810/glittering-the-being\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Glittering the Being</em></a><em> </em>(1958), and sculptures, such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20356/couple-iv\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Couple IV</em></a> (1959\u201360), which brought the dense linear networks of his paintings into three dimensions. The Art Institute\u2019s extensive holdings\u201440 artworks\u2014are among the best and most complete demonstrations of the range of Matta\u2019s long career.</p>",
