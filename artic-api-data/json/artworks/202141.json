    "description": "<p>When Sol Sender and his design team were approached to create the logo for then-Senator Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, they began their research by reading his books and listening to his speeches. Sender was particularly struck by Obama\u2019s 2004 speech at the Democratic National Convention, in which he described America as one people, not divided into red states and blue states. This logo retains a traditional red, white, and blue palette to reinforce the candidate\u2019s connection to the promise of a new America. Combining the O of the candidate\u2019s name with a symbolic sun rising over the American landscape, it represents not only the candidate himself but also a broader movement of hope and change.</p>\n",
