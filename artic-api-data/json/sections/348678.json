Govier was born in Lyme Regis, Dorset, in January 1824. He would have been seventy-one when Whistler executed his transfer drawings at the blacksmith shop on Broad Street where his two sons, Samuel Edward Govier (c. 1857\u20131934) and Thomas Pretty Govier (c. 1858\u20131941), also carried on the family trade. The elder Govier appears in at least two other lithographs (cat. 121 and cat. 123), as well as in The Little Forge, Lyme Regis (YMSM 442), a small panel painting now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow.\n\nThe Master Smith was one of seven images (cat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125) that Whistler mailed to the Ways in London on 27 September 1895 (letter 141). It transferred more successfully than many of the other drawings executed on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal in Lyme Regis, where the thin, gum-coated transfer paper seems to have been adversely affected by the damp sea air. In its simplicity and directness, the portrait is exactly what Whistler had hoped to achieve in his first group of Lyme Regis lithographs. He wrote to T. R. Way that he believed them to be \u201cmuch advanced in simple treatment\u201d (letter 143), and years later T. R. Way (1912) remembered that Whistler had considered The Master Smith \u201cone of his most perfect lithographs.\u201d\n\nAs originally transferred to stone, the image includes trial marks made with a pointed crayon to the left of the sitter\u2019s shoulder. There is also a smudge at lower right below the image and a small stray mark at upper right. Only one impression of this state has been located. Now in the British Museum, London, it once belonged to Thomas Way, and it is illustrated in the Levy (1975) catalogue.\n\nLondon: BM, cream wove proofing paper (246 \u00d7 187 mm).\n\nThe stray marks and smudges outside the image have been cleaned off the stone.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 227 mm), signed; SC, cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 221 mm).

Way mistakenly wrote that The Master Smith was drawn on a new transfer paper with which he himself had been experimenting in London. This cannot have been the case; the portrait was drawn before September 27, and T. R. Way did not send the new \u201cwhite transfer paper\u201d with \u201ca grained stone texture\u201d to Whistler in Lyme Regis until early October; letter 144. By October 21 the printers had not yet received any drawings on the new paper; letter 147.\n\nWhistler was grateful to George Govier for allowing his repeated visits to the shop while the blacksmiths were at work. He asked Marcus Huish of the Fine Art Society to frame an impression of The Master Smith so that he could \u201csend it down to the old Gentleman himself\u201d; Whistler to Huish, 30 December 1895, GUL LB3/20. He requested that it be sent to his lodgings before framing so that he could inscribe a \u201clittle dedication\u201d on its mount. That impression, still in its original mount, was acquired by Charles Lang Freer and is now one of two impressions in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 120, second state.
