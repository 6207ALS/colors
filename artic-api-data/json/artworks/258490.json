    "description": "<p>Edwaert Collier was well known in his own time for his still lifes, which replicated in intricate detail actual maps and globes. Here, he reproduced a portion of Frederik de Wit\u2019s 1660 map of the Americas and Jodocus Hondius\u2019s terrestrial globe with a view of Mexico, both of which allude to the Dutch Republic\u2019s international trade networks and the ambition to possess the world through cartographic knowledge. The extinguished candle and hourglass, in contrast, reference the fleeting nature of time. Through such highly illusionistic renderings of the symbols of worldly pursuits, Collier evoked the tension between humanity\u2019s lasting contributions to the fields of art and science and the brevity of an individual life.</p>\n",
