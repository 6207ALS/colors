    "description": "<p>The negative-positive process created by William Henry Fox Talbot, and the possibilities for reproduction that it introduced, dominated photography until the digital age. Talbot\u2019s initial experiments show both his interest in science (as he worked to refine his process) and his artistic aspirations. Scholars have confirmed that Talbot took 10 or more views of chess players, yet this one\u2014likely of noted photographer Antoine Claudet and Talbot\u2019s assistant Nicolaas Henneman\u2014may not be his. This print and other variants of the same scene are unsigned, and on a different paper from Talbot\u2019s normal stock. Recent scholarship posits that the images might have been made in Claudet\u2019s studio before ending up in Henneman\u2019s possession; this print could have entered Talbot\u2019s holdings when Henneman gave him prints as payment toward a debt.</p>\n",
