    "description": "<p>Tatiana Bilbao is an award-winning, Mexico City-based architect whose global practice is grounded in a commitment to sustainability, community, and context in design.</p><p>Born into a family of architects, Bilbao founded her multidisciplinary office in 2004 with a single fundamental ideal: \u201carchitecture should benefit every single human being on this planet.\u201d This goal has taken many different forms, from engagements with public space, including her work at the Botanical Garden of Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico, to research on social housing with projects like the Sustainable House, a low-cost housing prototype exhibited at the 2015 Chicago Architecture Biennial. A passionate teacher and lecturer, Bilbao is part of an international vanguard of architectural practice and education whose roots remain inextricably tied to the culture and history of Mexico City.</p><p>The Butler-VanderLinden Lecture on Architecture is presented in partnership with the Chicago Architecture Biennial and the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.</p><p>Presented by the Architecture &amp; Design Society</p>",
