    "description": "<p>Bruce Davidson practices documentary photography from a distinctly humanist perspective. Born in the Chicago suburb of Oak Park, he began photographing at age 10 and later studied at Yale University, where a class project\u2014photographing the football team\u2014resulted in his first <em>Life</em> magazine photo essay, in 1955. Three years later, after serving in the army and meeting the photographer <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33885/henri-cartier-bresson\" target=\"_blank\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>, he became a member of the photographic cooperative Magnum.&nbsp;</p><p>Davidson focused on charismatic individuals and marginalized groups, including <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2133317470003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Brooklyn Gang</em></a> (1959) and <em>Freedom Riders</em> (1961), a series about the civil rights movement. In 1962, with help from a Guggenheim Fellowship, he continued this series by focusing on the March on Washington and demonstrations in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186532/birmingham\" target=\"_blank\">Birmingham</a> and Selma, Alabama. He continued to shed light on the stories of specific communities in <em>East 100th Street</em> (1966) and <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2124832110003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Subway</em></a> (1980), among others.<br><br>In 1965 the Art Institute showcased Davidson\u2019s second major solo exhibition, organized by curator <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/edwards/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugh Edwards</a>. Coinciding with the exhibition, writer Gay Talese released his book <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2126498060003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Bridge: The Building of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge</em></a>, which included some of Davidson\u2019s photographs on view of men creating this massive structure.
