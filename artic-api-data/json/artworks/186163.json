Townhouses sit in groupings of three or four units around highly landscaped \u201cplacitas,\u201d forming natural conversation points in the landscape. The \u201cgreen-built\u201d homes are energy efficient, with active and passive solar energy elements and are structured to facilitate water harvesting. The community\u2019s three thousand five hundred square-foot common house is built from straw bale. Sonora\u2019s social practices are also typical of cohousing: community, collaboration, conservation. But the most unusual aspect of the community is no longer visible to the eye: Sonora cohousing is intentionally built on an urban infill site.\n\n\u201cInfill development\u201d refers to the practice of making use of underutilized or empty sites within urban areas. The founding members of Sonora wanted to avoid destroying untouched desert\u2014\u201cblading unbladed land\u201d\u2014 or becoming part of the suburban sprawl that requires new roads, sewers and schools every time a developer \u201cleapfrogs\u201d to build a community further out from the city center (developers are motivated to do so because the farther land may be less expensive\u2014and offer better \u201caccess to nature\u201d). The founders of Sonora not only made a choice for infill, they also adhered to the criteria that the site must be accessible by public transportation (in this case bus transportation) and that shopping must be within walking distance. What\u2019s more, they chose a neighborhood with a high crime rate by Tucson standards, and yet they refused to become a gated community. This has meant that bicycles, and charcoal grills and watermelons, are occasionally stolen\u2014but it also allows for meaningful interactions with neighbors (the three nine-year-old girls who stole the watermelon came back and sought out its grower to apologize).\n\nSomething else invisible in this photograph: when the garden was being built, resident Don Arkin helped to create a compost area by building a wall around it. The much-disliked, stucco-like material he used was referred to as \u201cdoncrete.\u201d An artist resident, Kendra Davies, created the mural that covers it without going through the community approval process. To date no one has objected.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
