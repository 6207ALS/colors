Harris, 1984.1173\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather was painted on a pre-primed, no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas. There is a 30 P stamp on the back of the stretcher. The painting is unlined and retains its original stretcher. A warp-thread match was detected with Monet\u2019s Vetheuil (1901; 1933.447 [W1643]) (cat. 42), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The off-white ground consists of two layers. The composition is dominated by bluish-gray tones with touches of local color applied in the foreground to define some of the forms. The brushwork is open, consisting mainly of a buildup of individual strokes. For the most part, the paint is relatively thinly applied, with the surface texture coming mainly from the canvas weave and a few low-relief brush marks. Changes in the spacing and angle of the arches of the bridge, as well as a change in the position of one or two of the smokestacks, indicate that the composition was initially painted from a significantly different perspective, one in which the bridge would have cut across the canvas at a sharper angle.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 38.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1900 (lower left, in blue paint) (fig. 38.2). Some of the underlying brushstrokes were still wet when the signature and date were applied (fig. 38.3).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond closely to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas (65 \u00d7 92 cm) (see Manufacturer\u2019s supplier\u2019s marks).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 17.0V (0.6) \u00d7 19.8H (0.5) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with Monet\u2019s Vetheuil (1901; 1933.447 [W1643]) (cat. 42).\n\nThere is mild, fairly regular cusping along all four edges of the canvas.\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting appears to retain its original stretching with iron tacks spaced approximately 5.5\u20137 cm apart. The cusping pattern appears to correspond to the placement of the original tacks. An additional set of copper tacks has been added more recently, in between the original tacks. On each tacking edge, there are two pairs of empty holes, each accompanied by numbers handwritten in black marker, starting from 1 on the bottom edge, running clockwise to 8 on the right edge (there is only one hole at 5 but the second hole may have been used for one of the copper tacks). The purpose of these holes is uncertain but may relate to framing.\n\nOriginal stretching: See above.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The painting appears to retain its original stretcher (fig. 38.4). It is a five-membered wooden stretcher with a vertical crossbar, mortise and tenon joints, and ten keys. Dimensions: outer depth, 2.0 cm; inner depth, approx. 1.8 cm; stretcher-bar width, 6.5 cm; crossbar width, 6.0 cm; crossbar depth, 1.2 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nStamp on stretcher back: 30 P (fig. 38.5).\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. There are many bubble holes in the ground layer (fig. 38.6). Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of two layers; this is consistent in samples from both the tacking edge and the picture plane (fig. 38.7, fig. 38.8). The lower layer ranges from approximately 5 to 40 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from approximately 20 to 130 \u00b5m in thickness.\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark and red or brown particles visible under magnification.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of silicates and possible calcium sulfate. The upper layer contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of alumina, silica, and silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nTechnical examination has revealed that some major alterations were made to the bridge and the two prominent smokestacks on the right side of the painting. The changes suggest that the artist initially painted the scene from a different perspective. The X-ray shows that the arches of the bridge were originally offset from their final placement and were also more closely spaced (fig. 38.9). The texture of the underlying strokes remains evident on the surface of the painting, especially when viewed in raking light (fig. 38.10). Where paint from the earlier composition is visible on the surface, it appears to be off-white or light in color, with the blues and greens of the final bridge and water painted directly on top (fig. 38.11). The tallest smokestack was initially painted further to the right (fig. 38.12). Under magnification, some pale-bluish-gray paint, which seems to be related to the painted-out smokestack, can be seen through breaks in the upper brushwork (fig. 38.13). A dense, radio-opaque area to the right of the broader, slightly shorter stack to the left may indicate that it was also initially painted further to the right. If this was the case, the two stacks would have originally been positioned closer to one another. Some dark-blue paint was observed below the surface in this area (fig. 38.14). These changes indicate that the scene was originally painted from a sharper angle, with the near side of the bridge beginning closer to the lower-left corner of the canvas and the far side ending close to or slightly above its position in the final painting. The orientation of some underlying brushstrokes at the lower-left corner, just visible at the edge of the transmitted-infrared image, could indicate that part of an additional arch was originally included at the left side of the bridge in the initial composition (fig. 38.15). A few areas of radio-opaque brushwork along the distant cityscape, which appear similar to the puffs of smoke visible on the surface, seem to suggest that the artist made some changes to the smoke clouds as this area was built up (fig. 38.16), but it is unclear whether the painted-out \u201cclouds\u201d were associated with the earlier composition or the final painting.\n\nMicroscopic examination of the painting surface indicates that a warm, off-white toning layer covers broad areas of the canvas in the area underneath the water and the bridge. The long, horizontal strokes in the underpainting of the sky seem to consist of a similar warm, off-white layer (fig. 38.17). The brushstrokes of this underlayer continue underneath the two most prominent smokestacks.\n\nIn the final composition, the work was painted using relatively loose, open brushwork and mostly thin applications of paint. Overall, the surface of the painting is quite flat, and includes little impasto or thickly textured brushwork; however, variations in surface are created through a combination of thin strokes that leave the texture of the canvas weave prominent (fig. 38.18); low-relief brush marks (fig. 38.19) (including those related to the earlier composition); areas of smooth, more fluid paint application (fig. 38.20); and light strokes that catch the high points of the dry brushstrokes underneath (fig. 38.21).\n\nThe palette consists predominantly of various gray hues, with only individual touches of more intense color\u2014mainly blues and greens\u2014used in the foreground to help delineate details like the traffic on the bridge and the ripples in the water. Often, these more intensely colored strokes were final additions to the painting; for example, the deep-green horizontal dashes in the water (fig. 38.22). At the upper-right and lower-right corners, a few strokes of warm pink and orange suggest light from the sun just outside of the frame (fig. 38.23). There is little actual blending of brushwork on the canvas. Even the structures in the distance, which visually blur into one another, consist of individual strokes and touches, although using a more monochromatic range of colors (fig. 38.24). Only a few areas, such as the vehicles on the bridge, involve some localized wet-in-wet paint application (fig. 38.25). Some areas of flattened paint around the edges suggest that the work may have been framed when the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). A few brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nXRF analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue, and cobalt violet.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1987 and left unvarnished; however, there appears to be a fair amount of discolored varnish residue and dirt embedded in the recesses of the paint texture throughout the surface. This is especially evident in the fine \u201cline\u201d that runs around the edges, just inside the frame rebate area. Microscopically, these residues are very dark and they affect the overall tonality of the work. It also seems that the varnish was only thinned in some areas, or selectively removed, resulting in an uneven surface of variable gloss (see Conservation History).\n\nA note in the conservation file indicates that the painting may have been cleaned in 1968/69.\n\nIn 1987, surface grime and yellowed varnish were removed.\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition. It is unlined and appears to retain its original stretcher and tacking. The canvas is stable and remains relatively flexible. The stretcher is keyed out slightly. The tension is good and there are no planar deformations. The paint layer is secure with only a couple of small losses near the edges and minor abrasion in the frame rebate area. There is a general network of very fine cracks that are visible microscopically. Slightly more pronounced cracks are visible in areas where the paint is thicker or more built up in layers. There are also stretcher-bar cracks, which are most pronounced along the vertical members. There is an area of scattered brown accretions at lower center, which appear to be old, as well as a few localized, resinous accretions on the left side. Traces of gold from the frame are visible near the edges. There are four marks, possibly executed in pencil, which extend from the foldover onto the picture plane, on the right and bottom sides. Their origin and purpose are unknown. A heavily discolored, natural-resin varnish and thick surface grime and nicotine were removed in 1987, and the painting was left unvarnished. The surface is currently rather uneven, with residual varnish remaining in some areas and older, dark varnish residues and dirt embedded in the recesses of the paint texture throughout the work. This seems to make the painting darker and patchier than it should appear. Cotton fibers are embedded in the residual varnish in places.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the picture. It is a French, late-seventeenth\u2013early-eighteenth-century, Louis IV, ogee frame with carved anthemion corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches linked by foliate scrollwork and centered shells on a quadrillage bed, sanded frieze, and ogee leaf-tip-and-tongue sight molding. The original gilded surface has been entirely compromised by an overpainted d\u00e9cap\u00e9-like finish. It is painted overall with a whitened, raw umber base with highlights in red and scattered passages of silver leaf. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetails. The impression of hardware marks from the original forged hanging plate remain on the back of the top frame molding. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ovolo with carved dentil; scotia side; ogee face with carved anthemion corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches, linked by foliate scrollwork and centered shells on a quadrillage bed; sanded frieze; and ogee carved with leaf-tip-and-tongue on the sight molding (fig. 38.26).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 11, 1904, for 9,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Paul Cassirer, Berlin, Nov. 28, 1904, for 11,500 francs.\n\nAcquired by Albrecht Guttmann, Berlin, by May 18, 1917.\n\nSold at the Albrecht Guttmann, Berlin, sale, Paul Cassirer (Berlin) and Hugo Helbing (Munich), Berlin, May 18, 1917, lot 69.\n\nAcquired by Howard Young, New York.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Potter Palmer, Chicago.\n\nAcquired by Anderson Gallery, Chicago, c. 1927.\n\nSold by Anderson Gallery, Chicago, to William Redfield, Chicago, c. 1927.\n\nGiven by William Redfield, Chicago, to his sister, Mrs. Mortimer B.

Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint contains cobalt blue; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrGr\\_84\\_1173\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201cMonet\\_1984\\_1173\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 16, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be the result of factors, such as keying out of the stretcher over time.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather, 1900 (W1557/1984.1173),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the canvases for the two paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: W1557, W1643,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe tacks were analyzed with XRF; see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrGr\\_84\\_1173\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGiven the near-pristine condition of the edges, it is possible that the painting has never been removed from its stretcher.\n\nThe 30 and the P do not appear in close proximity on the stretcher bar and, thus, were probably applied separately. This differs from the 30P stamp found on Monet\u2019s The Customs House at Varengeville (1897; 1933.1149 [W1455]) (cat. 35), where the number and letter are adjacent. The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from the cross sections.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles in both layers and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1984\\_1173\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 16, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrGr\\_84\\_1173\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is possible that this layer could have been used to block out elements of the earlier composition.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WatBrGr\\_84\\_1173\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 6, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.
