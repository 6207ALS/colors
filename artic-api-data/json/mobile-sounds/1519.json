    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: At the time this impressive armchair was made, America was fascinated by all things Egyptian. This infatuation coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, and Verdi's tempestuous Egyptian-themed opera Aida, which came along two years later.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Egyptian revival was one of a wave of revival styles in mid-19th century American design, all of which referred back to earlier styles and foreign cultures. A chair like this summons up the imagined opulence of the Ancient Egyptian Empire. Notice the gilt details and the tapestry, originally much more colorful, with its depictions of a temple and hieroglyphs on the padded seat back. The new demand for upholstered furniture followed the invention of upholstery coil springs. The designers of this piece, the New York firm Pottier and Stymus, provided complete home interiors for clients such as Thomas Edison. They also furnished the president's office and cabinet room at the White House, for Ulysses S. Grant.</p>\n",
