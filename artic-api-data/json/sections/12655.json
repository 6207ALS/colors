For much of that time she was also his live-in romantic partner, caring for him and managing his affairs while tirelessly posing for his work in every medium. She was a devoted model, capable of withstanding the grueling and interminable sessions Whistler\u2019s meticulous process demanded. Charming and refined, she was once described by the writer and art critic Th\u00e9odore Duret as having the air of a \u201cwoman of the world (dame du monde),\u201d and it is precisely this attitude of confident sophistication that animates the figure in the Art Institute drawing. Whistler\u2019s pen dances over Franklin\u2019s graceful form, capturing her vivacious spirit with bold and lively strokes. The artist\u2019s hand is seen here at its most confident, distilling the image to a minimum of line and shading without sacrificing legibility. As is often the case in Whistler\u2019s drawings, prints, and paintings of Franklin, she appears slim and elegant, her sophisticated bearing embodying the very characteristics that distinguish Whistler\u2019s artistic style.\n\nFranklin is shown here from the back, her face turned in profile. This angle draws attention to the fashionable silhouette of her dress, with its puffed shoulders and form-hugging fit. A few wavy lines serve to indicate flounced fabric pulled over the prominent bustle. Whistler often exploited this vantage point to accentuate details of costume in his portraits of chic women (see Study for \u201cArrangement in Black, No. 2: Portrait of Mrs. Louis Huth\u201d [recto]; Study for \u201cSymphony in Flesh Color and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland\u201d [verso], cat. 14; and Sketch after \u201cArrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder,\u201d cat. 20), and depicted Franklin in a similar attitude on several occasions (see Maud, Standing, fig. 26.1, [K 144]; and The Toilet, fig. 26.2, [Way 6]). Franklin also strikes a comparable pose in a rare photograph (fig. 26.3), calling to mind the contemporary fashion plates that provided compelling source material for style-conscious artists such as Whistler (fig. 26.4). While, as Margaret MacDonald points out, it is impossible to know whether Franklin selected her own outfits or whether they were dictated by Whistler, they consistently reflect an unfussy, sophisticated good taste.\n\nFranklin was herself an artist, exhibiting her work under the pseudonym Clifton Lin at both the Grosvenor Gallery and the Society of British Artists in London around the time Whistler made the drawing of her. Though almost no examples of her work survive, the titles of those exhibited suggest that she favored still lifes of flowers and figure studies as subjects. The end of Franklin\u2019s tenure as an exhibiting artist corresponded with the abrupt termination of her relationship with Whistler in 1888, when he married another artist, Beatrice Godwin. Franklin also eventually married, first the New Yorker John A. Little, then another New Yorker, Richard H. S. Abbott. She refused to speak about Whistler when his biographers sought her out in later years. Despite the tumultuous end of their relationship, her enduring mark on Whistler\u2019s life and the lives of those closest to him is attested by the fact that the present drawing was owned by Whistler\u2019s son, Charles James Whistler Hanson, until 1924. Though Whistler and Franklin\u2019s artistic collaboration ultimately proved impermanent, its imprint on Whistler\u2019s oeuvre is also indelible. His many images of Franklin bespeak a remarkably productive partnership, artist and model united in their commitment to furthering a shared aesthetic vision.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Portrait of Miss Maud Franklin corresponds to Margaret F.

Whistler also attested to Franklin\u2019s appealing qualities in a letter to his friend George Lucas, writing, \u201cI need not tell you that she is very charming and that you will be delighted with her.\u201d See Whistler to George Aloysius Lucas, Apr. 16, 1879, repr. in The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed.
