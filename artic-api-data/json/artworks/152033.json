This work illustrates a scene from Plutarch\u2019s series of biographies of famous men in which the Spartan king L\u00e9onidas spares the life of his traitorous son-in-law Cl\u00e9ombrote, exiling him from Sparta. After pleading for her husband\u2019s life, the king\u2019s daughter Chilonis departs with her banished husband and their two children.</p>\n",
