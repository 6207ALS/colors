    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Jewelry or extremely precious textiles were probably stored inside this lavishly decorated chest. It was made by Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle. Boulle\u2019s patrons in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century first included King Louis XIV and many of his courtiers. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: Boulle specialized in a type of marquetry that included tortoise shell, brass, pewter and sometimes ebony. And you would lay the design on a piece of paper over a package of thin veneers of tortoise shell, brass, pewter and then cut through his package of veneers with a saw according to the lines in the design. And when you were finished you would have essentially pieces of a puzzle that were reconstructed on the sides of the coffer to create these areas of negative and positive brass or tortoise shell dominating one or the other of the services.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Elaborate gilt bronze mounts complete the decorative scheme. The central head may represent Apollo the classical sun god. On either sides are cranes heads. Cranes were thought to hold a pebble in one claw which dropped in the water and woke them if they fell asleep. Therefore, they symbolized vigilance.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE:  And you see how the beaks of the cranes thread into the latches for the lid and they are, in fact, guardians or protectors of the contents of the box.</p>\n",
