    "description": "<p>Myron Goldsmith is recognized as one of the great innovators of tall-building structure, stemming from his training in architecture and engineering. Although he was responsible for many notable projects during his long career at Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Goldsmith is perhaps best known for his 1953 master\u2019s thesis, \u201cThe Tall Building: The Effects of Scale,\u201d in which he argued for new structural principles for very tall buildings. He proposed a range of new types, including a concrete \u201csuper frame\u201d and a series of diagonally gridded steel-tube structures. This research led to the groundbreaking trussed tube of the SOM John Hancock Center (1965) and underpins many spectacular tall buildings, from Norman Foster\u2019s Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank (1986) to the China Central Television Headquarters by OMA (2010).</p>\n",
