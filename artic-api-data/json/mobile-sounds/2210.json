    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: While traveling in Bangkok, Wa LeHulere stopped to look at a stack of books being sold on the side of the street. He was sorting through the stack when he happened upon a curious looking folder of language tapes</p>\n<p>KEMANG WA LEHULERE: I initially was very surprised if not shocked actually that they would be an American accent program. Just the idea of someone learning how to sound a particular way. I was thinking about this idea of mimicking something or the learning of, or acquiring a specific way of speaking.</p>\n<p>KEMANG WA LEHULERE: While sitting with these tapes I began to reflect on language  but also the act of speaking. There's a writer who is name Franz Ferdinand who said to speak is to support civilization. this line came into mind when I was thinking about these tapes and listening to them.  I was really interested in teaching a parrot how to speak American. But that became really complicated when we started discussing bringing the parrot over, also I hadn't done much research properly, about what parrots were you know? Their behavior. it's only once I got one that I began studying and then I realized to that they're quite sensitive animals actually so I had to scrub the idea all together of having a living parrot as part of the work.</p>\n<p>It's me thinking about the cultural impact of the United States of America in terms of an impact on South African society, so yeah it's me kind of meditating through a number of issues.</p>\n",
