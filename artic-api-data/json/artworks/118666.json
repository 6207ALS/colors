    "description": "<p>This drawing was reprouced as he frontispiece to Comte de Lautr\u00e9amont, Isidore Ducasse, <em>Oeuvres compl\u00e9tes: Chants de Maldoror, po\u00e9sies, lettres</em> (Paris, 1940). Lautr\u00e9amont was central to the alternative literary genealogy the Surrealists constructed for themselves; his violent, gothic epic, <em>Les Chants de Maldoror</em>, was particularly valued for its extraordinary poetic images, such as the famous metaphor &quot;as beautiful as the chance encounter on a dissecting table of a sewing machine and an umbrella&quot; (<em>Oeuvres compl\u00e9tes</em>, Paris, 1963 ed.,rev. and enl., p. 327), which virtually became the Surrealist's motto.</p>\n<p>Very little was known about Lautr\u00e9amont, however. Dal\u00ed claimed the portrait was obtained using his &quot;paranoiac-critical&quot; method, which he thought of as a &quot;spontaneous method of irrational knowledge&quot; (Salvador Dal\u00ed, <em>Conquest of the Irrational</em>, New York, 1935, p. 15). Usually, this method involved altenative readings of objective phenomena, as in the double images with which he was experimenting at this time (see <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105527\"><em>The Image Disappears</em></a>), which Dal\u00ed described as a form of delirium. Here, however, it seems there was no original object of image to provoke the paranoiac associations; the image developed spontaneously by a process of intense concentration of the imagination. Dal\u00ed once compared himself to a medium, able to &quot;see&quot; images &quot;that would spring up in my imagination: (Salvador Dal\u00ed, <em>The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed</em>, New York, 1961, tr. by Haakon M. Chevalier, p. 220), which he could the situate on the blank page of canvas.</p>\n<p>The focus on certain details and the emphasis on a single, gazing eye recall other portraits by Dal\u00ed of this period, most significantly his self-portraits in <em>Impressions of Africa</em> and related preparatory drawings for this painting of 1938 (Rotterdam, Museum Boymans-van Beuningen; Descharnes and N\u00e9ret 1994, vol. 1, pld. 671-73). Dal\u00ed may also have taken a cue from a mysterious image, a very detailed pencil drawing of a single eye, reproduced in <em>La R\u00e9volution surr\u00e9aliste</em> (2 [Jan. 15, 1925], p. 25) with the caption&quot;Marcel Proust, par Georges Bessi\u00e9re.&quot; Imagery centering on eyes or an eye is ubiquitous in Surrealist art, where it usually stands paradoxically for the idea of internal rather than external vision. Lautr\u00e9mont was regarder by the Surrealists as one of the great visionaries.</p>\n<p>Dal\u00ed signed this drawing with his own name preceded by that of his companion, Gala, whom he had met in 1929, when she was still married to Paul Eluard. This dual signature reflects the intensity of his relationship with Gala, which led to a degree of identification with her.</p>\n<p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 104-105.</p>\n",
