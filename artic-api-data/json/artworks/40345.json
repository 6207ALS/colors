    "description": "<p>There are few impressions of this rare, unfinished engraving by Jean Duvet, a metalworker in Dijon and Langres who served as royal goldsmith to both Fran\u00e7ois I and Henri II. The artist likely made this depiction of the three patron saints of the plague to offer hope during a pandemic sweeping eastern France. In the center forefront Saint Sebastian, usually portrayed with multiple lacerations from arrows, is shown without visible wounds. Saint Roch, on the right with the dog that rescued him offering bread, lifts his tunic to show the buboes on his thigh are gone. Saint Anthony died from ergotism, a sickness with gangrene-like symptoms that blackens the skin and is now commonly called Saint Anthony\u2019s fire. Here he is shown healthy and holding a book and bell.</p>\n",
