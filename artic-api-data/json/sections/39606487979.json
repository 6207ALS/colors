Adams Fund, 2015.359\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Today, twenty extant wood blocks (or segments thereof) carved and printed by Paul Gauguin are dispersed the world over from Prague to Paris, Basel to Boston, and elsewhere across Europe and the United States. Among them, eight intact blocks are from Gauguin\u2019s famed Noa Noa Suite of wood-block prints. The artist, before departing on his second journey to Tahiti, left these in Paris with his close friends and neighbors at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, William and Ida Molard; he returned to Tahiti with the two other blocks. These either broke or were deliberately disassembled along individual segments for reuse by the artist. Although it cannot be ascertained if this happened while the artist was in Paris or once back in Tahiti, he clearly used the smaller segments to create a series of smaller wood-block prints (see cat. 81, cat. 82, cat. 83, cat. 84, cat. 87, cat. 88, and cat. 89).\n\nThe present block, as well as nine others, were acquired by the artist\u2019s son Pola Gauguin in 1919 and were printed and published in 1921 in collaboration with the printing house of Christian Cato in Copenhagen. By the time this block was printed by Pola, superficial scratches and gouges had formed on its surface, which are visible in the posthumous impressions printed from it. Although the block remains structurally sound, several sections of the block cracked or shifted out of plane before the block was printed posthumously. The deepest of these cracks appear in the upper left and at center along the left edge. In the figure\u2019s head there is a series of small scratches, and following the contour of her back there is a more complex series of scratches in the darkest shadow at center. Smaller nicks and dents appear throughout.\n\nAfter printing the posthumous edition, the block was sealed with an opaque, visually contrasting oil medium, then inked in black to articulate the appearance of the lines Gauguin carved and incised into his block.\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 60.1.1).\n\nA pink oil-based medium was used to seal the block. It is composed of zinc stearate, barium sulfate, gypsum, and an iron oxide that is likely a synthetic red pigment (fig. 60.1.2). The zinc stearate, barium sulfate, and gypsum are all white and combined with the iron oxide provide a pink tone that contrasts highly with the black ink applied over it. The binder in it contains a drying or semi-drying oil as well as Pinaceae resin (likely pine resin). Black ink was rolled over the pink coating onto the high points of the block. The carved, gouged, and incised lines remain legible today, and it is likely that all of the blocks were initially treated the same way upon completion of the posthumous printing.\n\nThe end-grain boxwood block is composed of eleven individual sections of boxwood glued together and coated with a gray ground (see fig. 60.1.3). X-radiography was used to obtain an accurate count of the number of segments that were adhered together. The ground, applied in a later stage of the manufacturing process, was identified as zinc white in the block Gauguin used to carve Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (see cat. 55.1, fig. 60.1.3). Commercially produced blocks such as these were often coated to provide a smooth, homogenous surface. The ground also provided visual contrast so that when the artist carved into the dark wood block the incised and gouged lines would be readily visible against the light ground. The opaque materials used to coat this block after printing the posthumous edition obscure the underlying coating and prevent its identification by analytical means, although it is slightly visible in the lower right corner of the block under magnification.\n\n204 \u00d7 353 \u00d7 23 mm\n\nWhile it is impossible to determine with complete certainty how Gauguin\u2019s composition evolved on the wood block, it is likely that the artist began by drawing with a sharp needle to lightly incise the block with all of the major forms that populate the composition. Thereafter he used a series of gouges of various shapes and sizes to carve more deeply into the block. The most deeply gouged areas appear around the central form. Surface shape studies of a number of Gauguin\u2019s prints, monotypes, and transfer drawings as well as this block were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light (see fig. 60.1.1). Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the various tool marks made by the artist using needles and a variety of gouges. The depth of these marks were also quantified to create an accurate three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the block to aid in identifying the artist\u2019s tools. Gauguin used a combination of wood-engraving and woodcutting techniques on a block that was clearly manufactured for wood engraving. The hardness of the block precluded extremely deep carving, although it did afford him the opportunity to incise lines of varied depths throughout the working process. In fact, incised lines appear over gouged forms in several areas.\n\nThere are two small holes in the back of the block that do not extend all the way through to the front. They are located at either end of the block toward the top. Gauguin may have used them to secure the block to a solid surface to assure that it would not move during the printing process. Similarly placed holes can be found in other blocks of his, although they are located more toward the centers of the short sides, as in the block for Maruru (cat. 55.1), rather than toward the top as they are here. By positioning the block onto nails or screws that protruded from a work surface, Gauguin could prevent it from shifting as he carved and printed it and therefore have greater control over the registration. Although these holes are not level with each other, they may have also been used for hanging purposes (fig. 60.1.4).\n\nWhen Gauguin printed this block, the ink rarely filled the interstices formed by his carving tools, and most often the carved lines appear as white passages in the prints. However, among the more experimentally printed impressions, some of the deeply carved lines instead appear as tonal passages. This resulted when the artist used a soft roller to partially deposit ink into gouged passages and then printed the block on a more supple paper that conformed to its contours to lift the ink from within them. In impressions where a single hard roller was used to deposit ink only on the highest points of the block, there is a greater contrast of light and dark, and some of the finest needle-incised lines fill with ink and are rendered unreadable.\n\nThe block is in sound, stable condition. It does exhibit some cracking along section joins as well as minimal deformation overall. Evidence of the damage sustained by the block appears in posthumous impressions. The layer of pink oil media is very unstable with significant losses throughout.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nElizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 49.\n\nTwo segments of the original wood block for Te faruru (Here We Make Love) are now in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie in Prague; the remaining fragments are lost. Gauguin used the back of one fragment for Young Maoris (cat. 87 [Kornfeld 39]). The wood block for Te atua is now lost but it has been suggested in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints and by others that the segments were used for Oviri (cat. 84) and Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (cat. 85); see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E.

There are traces of zinc white on the block for Noa noa in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. At the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, analysis revealed the presence of stearic acid on two blocks, that for Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) and Auti te pape (Women at the River).

Residues of this pink paint can be found on the back of the block used for Maruru. Only this block remains completely coated, although the coating is unstable and has partially flaked off the wood surface. This may explain why the coating was removed from the remaining blocks. All of the known blocks were reinked in black, some with additions of brown.\n\nC\u00e9line Daher, XRF analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe reflectance transformation imaging (RTI/photometric stereo) research project was undertaken at the Northwestern University/Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts (NU-ACCESS), generously funded through a grant from the Andrew W.

Maurice Malingue, trans. Henry J. Stenning (World, 1949), p. 201, n. 1. Although this does not specifically mention the wood blocks from the Noa Noa Suite, it is probable that Gauguin left the wood blocks with his neighbors, William and Ida Molard; see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 49.\n\nAccording to Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 49, Druet lent eleven blocks (the eight left in Paris and another three sent back from Tahiti) to a 1918 exhibition in Stockholm. In 1919, they were sold to Pola Gauguin.\n\nAccording to Pola Gauguin in Galerie Aktuaryus, Galerie und Sammler (Galerie Aktuaryus, 1938), he bought ten of the plates in 1919 and began to experiment with them.
