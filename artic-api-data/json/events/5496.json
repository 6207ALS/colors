This summer, for the first time in decades, they were removed from their pedestals for extensive conservation. From a <a href=\"/articles/1015/water-lasers-and-wax-conserving-the-art-institute-lions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">steam-cleaning to a new wax coating</a>, the conservation team will discuss how they worked to ensure that the lions will watch over Michigan Avenue for years to come.</p>",
