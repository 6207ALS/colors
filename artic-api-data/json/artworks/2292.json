    "description": "<p>The authorship of this massive and vivid woodcut coat of arms has long eluded scholars. The crowning peacock feathers are an armorial augmentation bestowed on the family by Emperor Charles V in 1530. They prove that the famous Albrecht D\u00fcrer, who died in 1528, did not create the print. Indeed, the Nuremberg Kress family likely commissioned this ephemeral shield from one of his followers. The print was meant to be painted; the Kress heraldic colors included red, silver, and black. The dagger superimposed on the main shield would have been particularly striking against a rich red and silver filigreed backdrop.</p>\n",
