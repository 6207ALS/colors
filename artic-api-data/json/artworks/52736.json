    "description": "<p>Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard\u2019s highly personal, powerful style emerged after periods of study with both Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin, and over five years at the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome. Entitled <em>The Letter, or The Spanish Conversation</em> (because of the man\u2019s elegant attire\u2014with a doublet of full sleeves and a wide, stiff neck ruff\u2014a costume that was \u201cin the Spanish mode\u201d), this lively sheet depicts with wit and teasing ambiguity an intimate incident in an upper-class drawing room. The artist\u2019s rapid, virtuoso draftsmanship evokes forms with what seems like a minimum of effort, and his powerful handling of brush and wash reflects his ability to capture the effects of light. The interplay between the drawing\u2019s broad, free underdrawing and its shimmering veils of wash lend this work its charm and vivacity. The woman in this drawing is said to be Fragonard\u2019s sister-in-law, the artist Marguerite G\u00e9rard.</p>\n",
