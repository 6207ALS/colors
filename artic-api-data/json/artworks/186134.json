It was founded in 1963 when Huw \u201cPiper\u201d Williams returned to his home state of Washington from New England, where he was working as a peace activist and living on a communal farm. After purchasing some land, he invited his friends from the peace movement to join him in a \u201csimple living kind of alternative Christian lifestyle.\u201d Over the years those words have come to mean many things.\n\nWith one general meeting each year and weekly potlucks, the fifty members of Tolstoy Farm are happy to \u201cassociate and/or dissociate with each other freely.\u201d The group has steadfastly adhered to a single founding principle: no one could be forced to leave, so \u201cWe would have to work out our differences in the right way.\u201d At times the application of this rule has been tested in the extreme, but Tolstoy Farm remains a healthy, thriving commune.\n\nFor the past six seasons, a Community Supported Agriculture farm program (CSA) has prospered at the center of Tolstoy Farm. CSA programs are sometimes referred to as \u201csubscription farming\u201d: individuals pledge financial support to a farm operation before the growing season begins, so that both farmer and consumer share the risks and benefits of the crop. The CSA model is used by more than a thousand small farms in the US and Canada. A weekly box delivered to a subscriber of the Tolstoy Farm CSA in the month of September might contain corn, beets, carrots, chard, cucumbers, zucchini, kale, lettuce, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet and keeper onions, green peppers, pears, plums, winter squash, pumpkins, celery, tomatillos, garlic, hot peppers and green beans.\n\nTolstoy Farm takes its name from a historic settlement founded in 1910 outside of Johannesburg, South Africa, by Mahatma Gandhi as a base for passive resisters. In jail, Gandhi read Tolstoy\u2014the Russian author\u2019s renunciation of force as a means of opposition was formative to Ghandi\u2019s political philosophy. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
