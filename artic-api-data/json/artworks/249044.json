    "description": "<p>L. Morgan Yost was a Chicago architect and editor of <em>Small Homes Guide</em>, a magazine for the general public that was published by the National Homebuilders Bureau during World War II. The model residences featured in this journal were compact houses with modern appliances and layouts that often featured descriptive names like the \u201cHomecoming Home\u201d and \u201cHomes for our Children\u201d alongside images of happy couples and families. Emphasizing the patriotic vision of American homeownership promoted by the <em>Guide</em>, Yost described how his work \u201cdid a lot to encourage [soldiers] to dream about life when the war was over and they would come home.\u201d</p>\n",
