    "description": "<p>This vibrantly colored textile fragment displays a series of repeated designs presented in alternating rows of motifs. In one row, depictions of guanacos or vicu\u00f1as\u2014two camelids native to the Andean highlands\u2014appear between images of the animals\u2019 pelts, which are shown as if splayed out and flattened. Areas of loop pile woven using a dark brown pile create dimensionality in the piece while suggesting the texture of the animal\u2019s fleece, whose soft and warm wool was highly valued by weavers throughout South America. The other rows contain a variety of birds\u2014likely condors or another raptor\u2014and plants. These two motifs are often paired in Lambayeque textiles and may express sacred themes: plants typically denoted ritual hallucination and harvest rituals, while predatory birds were associated with the sky, powerful warriors, and the supernatural realm.</p>\n",
