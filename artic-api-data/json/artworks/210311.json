    "description": "<p>Architects who entered the design competition for the New Maribor Art Gallery in Slovenia had to respond to a detailed set of constraints. Most important, the project for this unique architectural complex needed to reflect a progressive curatorial agenda and allow the art gallery to become a civic hub. At the same time, the resulting architecture had to be sensitive to the robust historical fabric of the city. In his proposal Stan Allen negotiated these requirements by combining an open, flowing public plaza at ground level with smaller-scale gallery spaces. The intentional geometry of the gallery\u2019s roofline would have both set the building\u2019s design apart and blended into the existing cityscape.</p>\n",
