The small trees and overhanging branch appear to be in blossom, suggesting that the drawing was made in spring or early summer. It is probably one of the five images (cat. 23, cat. 24, cat. 25 cat. 26, and cat. 27) listed as having been transferred and proved by Way on 8 June 1888 (app. II.3 and app. II.4).\n\nDisliking the mechanical pattern of the coarse-grained transfer paper, Whistler applied the lithographic crayon lightly and created the shadowed areas with broad parallel hatching. In this way, he both minimized the obtrusive grain of the transfer paper and evoked the airy, sun-drenched atmosphere of the scene.\n\nAccording to the 1903 inventory, only one impression of this lithograph, which Rosalind Birnie Philip called Lindsey Houses, remained in the artist\u2019s estate.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (194 \u00d7 253 mm), signed; MWC, grayish ivory chine (139 \u00d7 213 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (280 \u00d7 382 mm), signed.
