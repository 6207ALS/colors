    "description": "<p>Join the conversation as we dig deeper into one of the 20th century\u2019s most influential artistic movements. How did the aftermath of the first World War drive a group of artists to reject traditional values in favor of radical exploration of the unconscious mind?&nbsp;</p><p>Learn about groundbreaking creative processes, materials, and symbolism in this tour of Surrealist art in our galleries. Participants are invited to reflect and discuss with one another as we consider how artists responded to tremendous social and political upheaval while pushing the boundaries of acceptable expression. As Andr\u00e9 Breton asked in his 1924 Manifesto of Surrealism, \u201cCan't the dream also be used in solving the fundamental questions of life?\"</p><p>If you have any questions about programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.
