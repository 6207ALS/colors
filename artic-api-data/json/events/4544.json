    "description": "<p>This month\u2019s Intersections topic is<strong> Collective Memory and the Lessons of History</strong>.</p><p>Fierce debates erupted in June when Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted an article that referred to U.S. detention camps at our southern border as \u201cconcentration camps.\u201d Subsequent responses have underscored the power of invoking certain historical events, particularly those tied to legacies of trauma and nationalism.&nbsp;In this discussion with educators Elizabeth Fei and Nenette Luarca-Shoaf, we\u2019ll think through what is gained or lost\u2014and who gains or loses\u2014when we use moments in history to make sense of contemporary events.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s wide-ranging collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Facilitators select featured artworks, which they will post here in advance of each discussion. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art.</p><p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a>&nbsp;to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a>&nbsp;two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
