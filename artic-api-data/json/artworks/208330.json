    "description": "<p>Charles Prendergast established a reputation as one of the finest frame makers of the early 20th century before dedicating his artistic career to producing exquisite decorated panels such as <em>Untitled (Rites of Spring)</em>. He began creating these whimsical works after visiting museums and churches in Italy, drawing on the Christian tradition of gilded panels and synthesizing them with the forms and figures he observed in non-Western art. He also relied on his skills as a frame maker, emphasizing carved and incised patterns, using gold and silver leaf to highlight his unique designs. He then set this panel in one of his own frames.</p>\n",
