II.3, II.4  \nLifetime Exhibitions: Chicago 1900b (no. 72)\n\nLike Figure Study (cat. 113), this image of a draped model seen from the back was drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal in Whistler\u2019s Paris studio in the fall of 1894. The two images were transferred to stone and proved by the Ways in mid-November (app. II.3 and app. II.4). When he saw the first proofs of the two lithographs, the artist wrote to T. R. Way that they were \u201cvery good\u2014but want cleaning\u201d (letter 131). He apparently intended to make revisions to both stones when he next visited his printers in London. In the end, however, neither image was reworked, and Whistler instructed his printers to erase the stones after only a handful of impressions had been pulled. He was willing to sign at least two impressions of Study, but he retained no proofs for himself.\n\nYears later, Joseph Pennell suggested that the young woman who posed for this lithograph was Carmen Rossi, one of Whistler\u2019s favorite models in Paris. However, Whistler\u2019s own letter to his printers, written on 10 November 1894, makes it clear that both figure drawings were made from the same model, \u201crather a poor one\u201d (letter 130). It is unlikely that he would have referred to Rossi in these terms.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (324 \u00d7 205 mm).
