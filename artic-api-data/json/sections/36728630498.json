The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. There is a stamp from the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros on the back of the original canvas. The work is largely composed of a thick buildup of vigorous brushwork, some of which is related to changes made to the composition in the painting process. The stone building and the caloges were planned from early on and are painted directly over the ground layer; however, major revisions were made to the fishing boats on the beach. It appears that the two boats on the left side were originally painted into the composition and then covered by the water; the boats seen in the final painting were added, mostly wet-in-wet, over the thick lead white\u2013rich paint of the waves. It seems that the artist wiped or scraped away some of the earlier paint, but traces of the rigging from the first boats remain visible. The two right-hand boats were incorporated into the composition early on; waves were subsequently painted over a significant portion of the left side of each boat, with elements of the final boats painted on top of the water. Some more-intense colors, which seem to be related to the earlier boats, are visible on the surface through breaks in the brushwork. A second winch may have originally been included to the left of the existing winch on the midright side of the painting, and a second figure was added later in the same area. Some slight adjustments were made to the position of the barrels in the foreground. The signature was applied after the painting had already been varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 22.1).\n\nSigned: Claude Monet (lower right corner, in red-brown paint) (fig. 22.2). The underlying paint layers were dry when the signature was applied. In addition, in some areas, the signature appears to lie on top of remnants of yellowed varnish (fig. 22.3) and to bridge cracks formed in the underlying paint layer (fig. 22.4). This indicates that the signature was applied after some cracks had already formed in the painting and after the painting had been varnished. Compared with an archival black-and-white photograph (dated 1922) (fig. 22.5), it appears that some of the signature paint may have been removed in a previous cleaning (see Conservation History).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 81.5 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (81 \u00d7 65 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 26.8H (0.8) \u00d7 28.8V (0.7) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave match was found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is moderate, relatively even cusping on the top, bottom, and left edges. The cusping is slightly more pronounced and irregular along the right edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1962 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). The canvas is attached with copper tacks spaced approximately 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: It was not possible to observe all of the original tacking edges because of fabric strips adhered to the edges on all sides.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 3.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1962-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. The 1962 examination report states that the previous stretcher was five membered, including a vertical crossbar, with mortised joints and keys. Depth: Not documented.\n\nA supplier\u2019s stamp on the original canvas back was transcribed before the painting was lined in 1962 (see Conservation History) (text within palette-shaped frame): H. VIELLE [sic] E TROISGROS S[. . .] / 35 RUE RAVEL [sic] [. . .] / PARIS / COULEURS FINES / TOILES PANNEAUX(fig. 22.6)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThere is a single, relatively thin ground layer that extends to the edges of the top, bottom, and left sides but appears to stop approximately 0.4 cm short of the right edge (fig. 22.7). This indicates that the canvas was cut from a larger roll of primed fabric on three sides; the right edge probably corresponds to the original edge of the roll that was attached to the priming frame. The canvas was probably commercially prepared. The ground ranges from approximately 20 to 125 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 22.8).\n\nOff-white; under magnification, some dark particles were visible (fig. 22.9).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains primarily lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of bone black, iron oxide with associated silicates, alumina, aluminum silicate, and silica. Both the lead white and the chalk exhibit particles and clusters of various sizes (fig. 22.10). Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe work was densely painted with thick, vigorous brushwork, particularly throughout the water and the beach. The paint surface, with its rough brushwork and rather cursory treatment of forms, would perhaps seem to suggest a rapid execution, but the work was, in fact, carried out in multiple sessions and involved several revisions to the composition as the work progressed. Small areas of exposed ground are visible in places, for example, in between the individual strokes of the stone wall on the right and along the edges of some of the other compositional forms (fig. 22.11); but, on the whole, the work consists of thick, relatively continuous paint, making it difficult to observe the earliest layers and the precise sequence of painting. The presence of brushwork unrelated to the final composition and small glimpses of anomalous colors below the surface, as well as the appearance of the work in the X-ray, however, indicate that the painting was heavily worked up and significantly revised in areas.\n\nThe stone building and caloges were planned from early on, laid in directly on top of the ground layer, and executed largely wet-in-wet with no evidence of any major modifications (fig. 22.12). Significant changes, however, were made to the beached boats in the middle ground. The heaviest reworking involved the two boats on the left side of the composition. These boats appear to have been included in the painting from early on; they were subsequently covered, however, by the thick paint of the water and the beach. In the final painting, the two boats were added on top, seemingly in a similar position to the earlier painting (fig. 22.13). Magnified views of the two boats on the left show that, for the most part, they were painted on top of the waves when the waves were still wet (fig. 22.14). Because of the density of the paint in this area, it is difficult to ascertain much about the earlier painting of the boats. Open drying cracks in the dark-purple paint of the boat on the far left, for example, reveal only the pale-blue paint from the intermediate layer of water underneath (fig. 22.15). However, the transmitted infrared image seems to suggest that both boats were originally somewhat larger or were pulled up further on the shore (fig. 22.16). In addition, traces of the rigging of both boats from the earlier painting stage remain visible to the unaided eye, positioned, in both cases, just to the right of the masts of the boats as painted in the final composition. There is evidence that the artist scraped or wiped away some of the soft paint of the earlier layers, resulting in a relatively smooth, flat paint surface (fig. 22.17). In these areas, only traces of the individual strokes related to the rigging remain. Some subsequent brushstrokes from the water partially cover the earlier rigging\u2014microscopic glimpses through breaks in the water often reveal the more colorful paint layers beneath (fig. 22.18)\u2014but it seems like traces of the earlier painting would have always remained visible upon close observation and that the artist was not overly concerned with concealing every trace of the earlier painting. In this area of the painting, in both the final composition and the earlier layers, it seems that there was a considerable amount of working back and forth between the boats and the water. For example, near the upper-left corner, just to the right of the upper portion of the main mast of the red boat, among the two roughly parallel fragments from the earlier rigging, the vertical stroke on the right was applied wet-in-wet into the water, whereas the stroke on the left was painted when the water was already dry (fig. 22.19). Similarly, single strokes from the final rigging were drawn through both wet and dry areas of paint from the water (fig. 22.20), indicating that, even within a fairly localized area, some strokes of the water were already dry while others were freshly applied when the rigging was added. There are some strong horizontal ridges near the left edge, visible in the X-ray and raking light image, which may also be related to the earlier composition (possibly an earlier position of the left boat or the initial lay-in of the water) (fig. 22.21). It is difficult to characterize precisely what changes were made in this part of the painting, but it seems that the two boats on the left were incorporated into the composition early on. They were then obliterated by a combination of scraping or wiping and painting the waves on top, before the final boats were executed.\n\nSimilar observations were made about the two boats on the right side of the composition, including brushstrokes unrelated to the final composition and the partial removal of the initial rigging. The X-ray indicates that these boats were incorporated early on, based on their relative radio-transparency; they too were painted over, in areas, however, with thick, white paint from the waves, mainly along the left side of each boat (fig. 22.22). Paint colors, seemingly unrelated to the final composition, are visible through breaks in the upper paint layers. Bright-yellow paint, visually similar to that used for the final yellow band of the boat farthest to the right, is visible from underlying layers around the base of this boat (fig. 22.23), and in the area of the beach between the two boats. Further down in the beach, dark-brown and purple paint is visible through breaks in the upper paint layers (around the winch), possibly indicating features unrelated to the surface composition (fig. 22.24). It seems that originally a second winch might have been included just to the left of the winch in the final painting. This was then roughly painted over when the earlier paint was dry (fig. 22.25).\n\nOther more minor modifications include the addition of a second figure between the winch and the stone building (fig. 22.24). The rust-colored paint used in this area to define what could be two figures was applied when the underlying paint was already dry; the left figure was laid in earlier, however, with strokes of deep-red and deep-blue paint. The placement of the barrels in the foreground between the two caloges was also changed slightly (fig. 22.26).\n\nBrushes, including 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint surface.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence indicates that red lake was used throughout the painting.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nA spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied in 1962 (see Conservation History). The surface coating is evenly applied and appears slightly glossy in some passages. Residues of an older, yellowed, natural-resin varnish are visible in the recesses of the paint texture. It is not known when the natural-resin varnish was applied but it was documented as being extremely discolored in 1957.\n\nIn 1962, discolored varnish was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and stretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. The paint and ground layers are secure. There is some flattened paint and depressions made near the edges when the paint was still soft, which are possibly related to framing or transport of the work early on. There is also some minor abrasion and mild gouges or scratches around the edges of the painting in the frame rebate area. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint surface. There is a general network of fine cracks, with more pronounced cracking visible in the thicker, lead white\u2013rich passages. Localized areas of drying cracks are also present, for example, in the darker paint layers of the boats. Under magnification, residues of old retouching are visible on many of the wider-aperture drying cracks. There are yellowed varnish residues in the recesses of the paint texture and underneath the signature; this latter condition suggests that the painting was signed after the work was varnished. The signature appears to have been compromised in earlier cleanings. There are some cotton fibers and facing tissue residues adhered to the surface of the painting. Fabric strips have been applied to the tacking edges with a thick white adhesive or paint.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame (from at least 1975) is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, nineteenth-century, Salvator Rosa, scotia frame with applied composition ornament of acanthus leaf on the outside edge, laurel and berry above the scotia, and an acanthus-leaf-and-tongue sight molding. The frame is water gilded over yellow bole on gesso and composition. The convex top molding is burnished; all other areas are left matte. The frame retains its original glue size. The frame is made of poplar, with applied mitered back, front, and sight moldings on a half-lapped cassetta base. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ogee with acanthus-leaf composition ornament; scotia side; convex face with treacle back edge; ovolo laurel-and-berry composition ornament; scotia (hollow); ogee with acanthus-leaf-and-tongue composition ornament; and originally a fillet (the fillet edge has been reduced back to the edge of the applied ornament). The independent fillet liner with cove sight is a later addition (fig. 22.27).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from [unknown] by Georges Bernaert.\n\nAcquired by Georges Bernheim, Paris, c. 1907.\n\nAcquired by Marczell de Nemes, Budapest, by 1911.\n\nSold at the Marczell de Nemes Sale, Galerie Manzi-Joyant, Paris, June 18, 1913, lot 113, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, as an agent for an unnamed person, for 9,500 francs.\n\nAcquired by Kleinberger Gallery, Paris, by Nov. 15, 1922.\n\nAcquired by John Levy Galleries, Paris, by Nov. 15, 1922.\n\nSold by John Levy Galleries, Paris, to Charles H.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that is used by the catalogue raisonn\u00e9. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\n\nJune 1911: Strandbild (August L. Mayer, Katalog der aus der Sammlung des Kgl. Rates Marczell von Nemes, Budapest, ausgestellten Gem\u00e4lde, with a preface by V. Tschudi, exh. cat. [F. Bruckmann, 1911], cat. 34 [ill.]).\n\nJune 18, 1913: Plage (see Galerie Manzi-Joyant, Paris, Catalogue des tableaux modernes, collection de M. Marczell de Nemes, sale cat. [Galerie Manzi-Joyant, June 18, 1913], lot 113 [ill.]).\n\nNov. 15, 1922: La Plage \u00e0 Etretat (purchase receipt on John Levy Galleries letterhead, dated Nov. 15, 1922, to Mr. C. H. Worcester; curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nNov. 24, 1922: les Barques \u00e0 Etretat (archival photograph of Boats on the Beach, inscribed by George Bernheim and dated Nov. 24, 1922; curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nThe Art Institute currently uses the date used by Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 386, cat. 1024 (ill.); 388.\n\nA caloge is a retired fishing boat that has been converted into a storehouse by covering the hull with either tarred wooden planks or thatch.\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains lead white, vermilion, emerald green, cobalt blue, and viridian. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Boats\\_47\\_95\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nEarly photographs of the painting indicate that the signature was in place as early as 1911, see preface by V. Tschudi, Katalog der aus der sammlung des kgl. rates Marczell von Nemes \u2013 Budapest. Ausgestellten gem\u00e4lde, exh. cat. (F. Bruckmann A.\u2013G., 1911), cat. 34 (ill.).\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_95\\_Monet\\_analytical report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions are based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet Boats on the Beach at Etretat (W1024/1947.95),\u201d Aug. 2011.\n\nThe more pronounced and irregular cusping on the right edge may correspond to primary cusping related to the commercial priming of the larger roll of canvas from which this canvas was cut (see Ground Application/texture).\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination report, June 4, 1962, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe original canvas back is now obscured by the lining canvas. The stamp was not visible when the painting was viewed with transmitted light.\n\nBased on the observation of more well-preserved stamps on other Monet paintings in the collection, the text probably reads: H. Vieille E. Troisgros [S. . .] / 35 Rue de Laval 35 / Paris / Couleurs Fines / Toiles Panneaux.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThe fabric strips adhered to the tacking margins were removed in only a few places, so only a small section of each tacking edge could be observed.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_95\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_95\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Boats\\_47\\_95\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA caloge is a retired fishing boat that has been converted into a storehouse by covering the hull with either tarred wooden planks or thatch.\n\nAs John House has pointed out, such changes could be a function of the constant movement of the boats or simply the result of aesthetic decisions (John House, Monet: Nature into Art [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988], 188).\n\nIn comparison with The Departure of the Boats, \u00c9tretat (1885; 1922.428 [W1025]) (cat. 23), the brushwork of this painting is looser and the forms are less clearly delineated: for example, the winch and the poles on the left side of the beach are less fully articulated than in the other work. Similarly, the windows on the stone building are less defined than in Departure. Here, the windows almost dissolve into the wall; they are only differentiated from the brushwork of the stones by the colors of the strokes (MAC 18). The vantage point for the two paintings seems essentially the same, although this work was painted on a slightly smaller canvas and the perspective seems slightly lower and closer; for example, the yellow boat on the right side seems larger compared with the same one in Departure. In Boats on the Beach, there is little in the painting of the water to suggest recession into space, with the result that not only the crashing waves, but all of the water, seems to be pushed forward toward the viewer.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, vermilion, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM); cadmium yellow (XRF). Traces of iron detected with XRF in several areas could indicate the use ofiron oxide pigments but further analysis would be required to confirm this. While the presence of viridian was confirmed by PLM, the presence of chrome yellow cannot be excluded in other areas of the painting where chromium was detected with XRF. Paint scrapings taken in 1983 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_95\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 17, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1947\\_95\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Boats\\_47\\_95\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.
