    "description": "<p>Can modern art make you queasy? Throughout the 20th century, artists such as Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Giorgio de Chirico, and Pablo Picasso seemed to very suddenly shift from advanced and highly regarded techniques to styles of painting widely perceived to be derivative, decadent, or in gleefully poor taste. <br><br>In this gallery talk, Jennifer Cohen, research associate in the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, navigates these waters, exploring Magritte\u2019s so-called <em>p\u00e9riode vache</em> or \u201cnasty style.\u201d The long-term loan of Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Le mal de mer (Seasickness) </em>(1947) provides the occasion for this history of modern painting gone rogue.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the image on this page is for reference purposes only and may not be featured during the gallery talk.</p>",
