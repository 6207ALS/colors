The artist\u2019s captivation with the reclining nude and lightly draped female figures stretches back to the very beginning of his career, exemplified by his early etching Venus (fig. 33.1; [K 59]), but his return to lithography also coincided with a revived focus on these types of subjects. In the manner of the Tanagra figurines (see cats. 31\u201332) that were a source of inspiration, Whistler\u2019s models stand, dance, sit, or, as in this case, recline. Here, he shows his model in the environs of his studio in Paris, where he and his wife Beatrice had relocated from London in 1892. In images such as this one, the artist concerned himself with finding ways to indicate the skim of fabric over human form with ever more minimal line and shading.\n\nWhereas in his earlier lithographic campaign of 1878\u201379 he had experimented with using both lithographic stones and transfer paper to create his images, he now principally practiced the transfer-paper method. Using this technique, an artist draws with lithographic crayon or ink on a specially coated paper that can then be used to transfer the image directly onto a lithographic stone for printing, destroying the original sheet of paper in the process. Until 1894, Whistler primarily relied on papier viennois (\u201cViennese paper\u201d) for his transfer drawings. It was available in three different grades with varying surface textures: no. 1 (fine), no. 2 (medium), and no. 3 (coarse). Reclining Draped Figure was drawn on the fine-grained paper that the artist tended to favor in 1893. The paper was probably supplied to him by his printers in London, Thomas Way and son Thomas R. Way, who together spurred on Whistler\u2019s explorations of the medium. The lead white\u2013based coating of Reclining Draped Figure has oxidized over time, causing discoloration. The deterioration of this coating, combined with the fact that the drawing was at some point adhered to a secondary support that restricted its movement, has also led to visible cracking on the surface.\n\nIn addition to the lithographic crayon Whistler employed for the majority of the composition, traces of stumping are also discernible, forming a hazy cloud in the area of the model\u2019s face and hair. The date of the drawing places it among Whistler\u2019s earliest experiments with stump work, and here he does not yet appear to have fully mastered the technique. The line and shading throughout, though characteristically delicate, seems less assured than in other, transferred lithographs from this period. The drawing also shows passages of reworking and indecision. The most conspicuous of these are the alterations made to the positioning of the model\u2019s left arm and shoulder. Judging that Reclining Draped Figure needed more modifications than could be reasonably undertaken, Whistler must have decided to abandon this particular attempt rather than transfer it to a stone. Nevertheless, the drawing reads as a complete thought, bolstered by its dual butterfly signatures.\n\nThe lithograph Nude Model, Reclining (fig. 33.2; [Way 47]), completed in the same year as Reclining Draped Figure, looks to be an effort in the same direction as the Art Institute\u2019s untransferred drawing that Whistler deemed more successful. Indeed, these two images share not only marked similarities of subject, pose, and handling, but likely also the same model, Carmen Ca\u00efra (later Carmen Rossi), who would have been about fourteen years old at the time he drew her. Rossi had begun posing for Whistler the year before, and soon became one of his favorite models. In 1898 she transitioned from artist\u2019s model to proprietress of the short-lived Acad\u00e9mie Carmen (1898\u20131901; first briefly called the Acad\u00e9mie Whistler), a teaching studio where Whistler sporadically instructed. In 1901 she left the art world altogether to run a wine shop. Rossi was, in fact, Reclining Draped Figure\u2019s first documented owner; it was sold by her, along with several other Whistler artworks, shortly after his death in 1903.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Reclining Draped Figure corresponds to Margaret F.

Stratis and Martha Tedeschi (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1998), 1:109.\n\nWhistler did, however, continue to occasionally work on stone during this period. Nicholas Smale notes that in 1893 Whistler produced approximately nineteen lithographs. Of these, sixteen were drawn on transfer paper, and three on stone.

As Smale indicates in his essay, the Ways supplied Whistler with papier viennois from 1887 on; see Smale, \u201cWhistler and Transfer Lithography,\u201d 75.

Whistler\u2019s extensive correspondence with the Ways is also reprinted in this volume. Thomas R. Way later wrote a biography of Whistler that offers useful insights into the artist\u2019s working methods, particularly in lithography. See T. R.
