    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">The left side of this folio is dominated by the torso of a man whose body extends into folio 8C/D. Scratching defines his facial features. In one hand he holds a bowl; in the other he clutches several dead animals and a fish. Despite his respectable attire, he wears glasses, signaling deception or falsity, and has a large ear, then linked with degeneracy. His sores may be syphilitic. With lesions covering his head, a goiter on his neck, a jacket that turns into feathers, and pointed fingers, the man unites various motifs from popular culture, including J. J. Grandville\u2019s satirical merging of animal and human Sc\u00e8nes de la vie priv\u00e9e et publique des animaux (Scenes from the Private and Public Life of Animals). In particular, the textured skin and the jacket sleeve that is transformed into a layer of feathers are drawn from Grandville\u2019s depiction of a banker as a turkey (fig. 1).\n\nThe bourgeois man\u2019s deformed face recalls that of Joseph Carey Merrick, the so-called Elephant Man (see fig. 2, fig. 3, and fig. 4). Poor and unable to work, in 1884 Merrick contacted the owner of a music hall in Leicester, England. Together they established a successful act called \u201cThe Elephant Man, Half-a-Man and Half-an-Elephant,\u201d in which Merrick displayed his increasingly misshapen body. While on an ill-organized tour of Europe, Merrick lost all of his savings to his road manager, who abandoned him in Brussels in 1886. Merrick attempted to return to England via Ostend on the Dover ferry but was refused passage. In the present sheet, Ensor reworked the Judenhut (literally, Jewish hat; see fig. 5 and fig. 6) that originally sat on the man\u2019s head into a top hat. Combined with his pointed fingers, the hat suggests the man possesses a devil-like nature and alludes to contemporary caricatures of Jews (see fig. 7).\n\nAlthough the writing on the man\u2019s sash\u2014VIVE ANTOINE NOTRE SEIGNEUR ET LABRE (Long live Anthony, Our Lord, and Labre; see folio 8G/H and sheet 8I)\u2014implies he is making an offering to Saint Anthony and to Saint Benedict Labre (see fig. 8), various obscene and scatological details impugn the sincerity of the oblation. These include a strange bird-monster who defecates into the bowl and whose erect penis is near the man\u2019s lips. Known for his poverty and good works, Labre was canonized by Pope Leo XIII in 1881 (see sheet 8I for more on this saint). Many people, including Ensor, identified with his rejection of materialism and his role as a healer and holy fool. Indeed, the saint\u2019s feast day is April 16, only three days after Ensor\u2019s own birthday.\n\nA historical restoration is preserved along the center top edge. Artist\u2019s patches were formerly placed in the center of the sheet, covering the bird\u2019s genitals, and at lower center, over the word Labre in the beggar\u2019s sash. SMC/KJN\n\nAppearing in large numbers on the streets of Belgian cities involved in the late-nineteenth-century revolution, banderoles, or banners, were strips of fabric onto which words were printed or painted. Described as \u201cwritten expos\u00e9s,\u201d banderoles were a disposable but indisputable part of street life, where they usually expressed political statements. Ensor used them frequently in his depictions of crowds. In The Temptation, the bourgeoisie are preceded by a figure carrying a banderole that pays tribute to Saint Anthony and Saint Benedict Labre, who was the patron saint of bachelors, the mentally ill, and the homeless. A similar figure marches in the foreground of The Entry of Christ into Brussels (fig. 9); his banderole pays tribute to Jesus, King of the Jews, and to Edward Anseele, a leading figure in the Belgian socialist party who championed universal suffrage within it. In 1881, he founded the first Belgian cooperative, Vooruit, of which he became the first director in 1884. Ensor also alluded to Anseele in his drawing The Lively and Radiant: The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem (fig. 10). ST\n\nfig. 1 J. J. Grandville (pseud.
