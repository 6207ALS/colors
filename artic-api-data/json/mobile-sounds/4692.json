    "transcript": "<p>Gloria Groom: Welcome! My name is Gloria Groom and I\u2019m Chair of the Department of European Painting and Sculpture. We\u2019re really excited to be presenting the Monet exhibition. We have had Monet exhibitions in the past but this is the first time to really focus on the artist and his impact on the city of Chicago and at the Art Institute. We\u2019ll be talking about those important early collectors of Monet\u2014the Palmers, the Ryersons, the Coburns\u2014and, of course, other collectors throughout the 20th century. But we also want to be able to reveal some of the discoveries that have been made in the Conservation Lab with conservators and curators and art historians as we\u2019ve looked very deeply and closely at his paintings. It\u2019s really a celebration of the artist but also the history we\u2019ve had with the artist in the city of Chicago.</p>\n<p>So in the next room what you\u2019ll see are photographs of the three most important collectors of Monet early on\u2014how they lived with his paintings, how they looked, a little biography on them\u2014to really get you into the story that Monet was not necessarily a household name but he was certainly appreciated by the leaders of the Chicago cultural life of that time</p>\n",
