    "description": "<p>Join Michael Seymour, associate curator in the department of Ancient Near Eastern Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as he discusses Assyrian reliefs and the construction of empire.</p><p>From the ninth through seventh centuries BCE, Assyria, centered in today\u2019s northern Iraq, was the dominant imperial power in the Middle East. The empire\u2019s rulers lined the walls of their palaces with carved stone reliefs depicting the king, supernatural figures, royal hunting scenes, and Assyrian military campaigns across an area stretching from Egypt to Iran. The last form a particularly striking category, showing the violence of empire but also employing landscape and narrative in new ways to represent and participate in the construction of a particular image of Assyria and its wider world. This lecture will focus on the dynamic between palace, empire, and imperial vision, and explore some of the ways in which the sculptures can contribute to more complex readings of all three.</p><p>Generously supported by the Mary Soleiman Lecture Fund. </p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.
