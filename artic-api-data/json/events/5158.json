Bryan Chair and Curator of Architecture and Design.</p><p>Koolhaas is the 14th speaker to deliver the Butler-VanderLinden Lecture on Architecture, a public program hosted by the Department of Architecture and Design.<em><br></em></p><h2>ABOUT THE SPEAKER</h2><p>Rem Koolhaas ( born 1944, Rotterdam) founded the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) in 1975 together with Elia and Zoe Zenghelis and Madelon Vriesendorp. He graduated from the Architectural Association in London and in 1978 published <em>Delirious New York: A Retroactive Manifesto for Manhattan</em>. In 1995 he published <em>S,M,L,XL</em>, \"a novel about architecture\" in which he summarized the work of OMA. He co-heads the work of both OMA and AMO, the research branch of OMA, operating in areas beyond the realm of architecture. His built work includes the Axel Springer Campus in Berlin (2020), the Qatar National Library and the Qatar Foundation Headquarters (2018), Fondation Galeries Lafayette in Paris (2018), Fondazione Prada in Milan (2015/2018), Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in Moscow (2015), the headquarters for China Central Television (CCTV) in Beijing (2012), Casa da Musica in Porto (2005), Seattle Central Library (2004), and the Netherlands Embassy in Berlin (2003). Current projects include the Taipei Performing Arts Centre and the renovation of Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. Koolhaas directed the 2014 Venice Architecture Biennale, curated <em>Countryside: The Future\u2014</em>an exhibition about non-urban areas around the globe that opened in February 2020 at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, and is a professor at Harvard University.</p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer, and downloading the latest version of <a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a> to enjoy this program.</p><p>If you have any questions about virtual programming, please reach out to <a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.</p><p>Closed captioning will be available for this program.
