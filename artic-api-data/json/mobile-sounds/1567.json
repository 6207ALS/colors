    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The great Venetian artist Tintoretto painted this dramatic scene around 1580. It tells the story of Lucretia who virtuously resisted the advances of Tarquin, son if the last king of Rome. Curator Martha Wolf.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLF: Lucretia was forced to submit to Tarquin and she was so humiliated and distressed that as a consequence she told her husband what had happened and then she took a dagger and killed herself in order to preserve the virtue of her family. The intertwined figures of Tarquin and Lucretia really sort of encapsulate the whole story, because what we see is not only Tarquin\u2019s attack and Lucretia\u2019s resistance, but we also seem to see her submission at the same time. The violence of the scene is wonderfully expressed in the way Tintoretto has composed it. We see her necklace is broken and the chain of pearls is falling almost in suspended animation down from her figure. And then this richly draped bed, which is actually composed of posts made out of four nude figures, probably intended to be in bronze-- one of the figures is toppling down.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Tintoretto also hints at the stories tragic ending. A dagger at Lucretia\u2019s feet maybe the one with which she will later take her life.</p>\n",
