By September they had settled into their lodgings at the Royal Lion Hotel, overlooking Broad Street and close to the beach. Whistler took a studio at 51 Broad Street and began work on a number of paintings on canvas and on small wooden panels. He also resumed drawing on lithographic transfer paper. On September 27 he sent the Ways the first Lyme Regis images, a group of seven transfer drawings made on sheets of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal he had brought from Paris (letter 141). Six of these sketches were made in the Govier family\u2019s smithy in Broad Street (cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125). The other was The Little Doorway, Lyme Regis, the only subject mentioned specifically in the letter he wrote to accompany the drawings (letter 141). He urged the printers to process the transfer drawings as quickly as possible and cautioned that \u201ca light and rather dainty one of children in a doorway ought perhaps to be rushed on first\u2014as it was a damp evening\u2014and I fear the chalk might soon be affected.\u201d\n\nAfter it was transferred, the image printed unevenly, and some of the lines appear to have lost their original crispness. It is possible that the damp climate of Lyme Regis affected the transfer paper on which Whistler drew the scene. Although the artist hoped that the Ways would \u201cget a lot of colour\u201d from the new drawings, that was not to be the case (letter 141). Impressions vary significantly in intensity. In the letter that T. R. Way sent to Whistler with the first proofs of the seven Lyme Regis images, he explained that the earliest impressions were very pale and that it had been \u201ca sort of guesswork on our part as to how far you would like the strengthening to go\u201d (letter 144). Despite Whistler\u2019s initial disappointment with the proofs, he liked The Little Doorway, Lyme Regis and included it in the exhibition of his lithographs at the Fine Art Society a few months later.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 277 mm), signed; Palmer, cream wove proofing paper (284 \u00d7 222 mm).

The authors are grateful to Mr. Fowles for his identifications of the local sites and customs depicted in Whistler\u2019s Lyme Regis lithographs (esp. cat. 133, cat. 134, and cat. 135).\n\nThe Ways had successfully transferred and printed numerous subjects drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal since the late summer of 1894, so it is curious that they had such trouble in transferring the first group of Lyme Regis images. As T. R. Way explained in his letter of October 1, the drawings appeared so faint that it was difficult for the printers \u201cto see them at all\u201d; letter 144.\n\nWhen Whistler first included the subject on a list of images for the Fine Art Society exhibition, he called it The Old Doorway\u2014Lyme; app. I.1.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 119, only state.
