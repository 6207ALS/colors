Such ghoulish subjects had long been appreciated in Northern Europe for the way they combined a sense of wild, supernatural threat with scientific observation of the natural world\u2014seen here in the detailed moth wings of the howling figure on the right and the deft rendering of the frog\u2019s splayed body. Cornelis Saftleven responded to Dutch buyers\u2019 evolving taste by treating his fantastic subjects with fine brushstrokes and a limited color palette.</p>\n",
