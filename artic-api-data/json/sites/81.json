    "title": "Playing with Pictures: The Art of Victorian Photocollage",
    "description": "Collage is commonly thought of as a modern art form, but the act of \u201cplaying with pictures\u201d has a long, rich, and surprising history. Sixty years ahead of the avant-garde\u2014and more than a century before Photoshop\u2014aristocratic Victorian women were already experimenting with photocollage. This world-premiere exhibition is the first to comprehensively examine this little-known phenomenon, presenting many eye-opening works that have rarely\u2014and in many cases never\u2014before been displayed or reproduced. See Playing with Pictures at the Art Institute before it travels to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto. It might change the way you look at the Victorian age.",
