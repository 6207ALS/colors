    "description": "<p>In <em>Silver Tanks</em>, Arthur Dove juxtaposed contemporary manmade elements with the timeless forces of nature: large industrial tanks, which the artist rendered in metallic paint, are contrasted with a massive, glowing moon. By depicting only an abstracted section of the tanks, Dove accentuated their vertical thrust and downplayed their function. The moon, a shimmering blue circle, is enlarged and surrounded with a dynamic aura. Both moon and tanks are seen in close proximity, making the moon appear equal to the tanks. In doing so, Dove did not unabashedly celebrate the human power implied by such industrial structures. Instead, he presented them as transformed by nature\u2019s strength.</p>\n",
