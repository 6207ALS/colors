Inspired by the Swiss philosopher Johann Kaspar Lavater, the artist believed a person\u2019s character depended on the animal he resembled. As Tischbein wrote in 1796, \u201cI have undertaken another [series of drawings] in order to learn more about man. To make this study easier it is necessary to begin with beasts, since they are easier and their characters more evident.\u201d Traditionally busy animals, these furry beavers exhibit human expressions as they focus diligently on the difficult task of stemming an exuberant waterfall.</p>\n",
