Harrison Collection, 1933.892\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet created Caricature of a Man in a Small Hat with graphite on a smooth, cream wove card, centering the figure on the sheet. The artist worked out the figure with light, quick strokes of graphite, followed by darker, broader lines to more fully establish the form. The face remains delicately rendered with minimal modeling. Dense passages of graphite were used selectively to create darker values in the hat and pant leg and to establish minimal shading behind the neck and below the proper right arm.\n\nClaude Monet (recto, center top edge, in graphite).\n\nCream, very thick, very smooth wove card.\n\nUniform.\n\nEven.\n\nThe corners are rounded irregularly. Pinholes appear on the center top and bottom edges, as well as near the upper left corner. A partial pinhole is visible at the lower right corner.\n\n198 \u00d7 149 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using soft, dark graphite to establish the outline and the form of the figure. The figure\u2019s face was drawn very carefully with light, short strokes for the profile and eyes. The artist reinforced these lines slightly by adding a little pressure to the stroke to create a darker line. This can be most clearly seen in the tip of the nose, lips, and eyes. The artist quickly sketched the body of the figure with faint, quick, short strokes followed by darker, longer strokes to further develop the outline. Not much emphasis was put into the shading of the body; tonal effects were created by using the side of the graphite or the dull tip of the graphite with a back-and-forth motion, as seen in the figure\u2019s hat. The artist used this method of application to shade areas quickly and effectively. The pant legs, collar, and right underarm are the only areas of shading. The shading lines were created with the same back-and-forth motion as that used for the face and hat.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. There is light surface soiling and slight discoloration overall with a few black flyspecks. There are stray graphite markings along the upper left edge and near the bottom left corner. There are several small brown foxing spots throughout the sheet on both the recto and the verso. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, hundreds of foxing spots that are not visible in normal conditions fluoresce yellow. The corners are all rounded irregularly, and there are a few pinholes. The pinhole at the center of the top edge has an associated tear with a small amount of paper loss. The pinholes have rust deposits in and around the cavities. There are several areas of paper abrasion and skinning. The most notable area of skinning is along the edge of the desk, with brown accretions in the paper-fiber interstices. The other areas of skinning are located along a horizontal band near the center of the sheet and at the center, the left edge, and near the figure\u2019s proper right hand. There are two thin scrapes of the paper support near the left corners. These scrapes have abraded paper fibers, and there is a faint accumulation of surface grime embedded in the fibers. There is a crescent-shaped crease behind the figure\u2019s legs. There is a buildup of graphite media along the ridge of the crease. On the verso, there are green paper remnants along the edges, along with residual adhesive. There are old white paper hinges along the edges as well as residual adhesive. There is a small area of paper skinning at the upper right corner.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D496 (ill.); 144, cat. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
