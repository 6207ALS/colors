    "transcript": "<p>LESLIE BAUM:  Hi. My name is Leslie Baum, and I am a painter and an art educator here at the Art Institute. We are looking at a painting called &quot;St. George Killing the Dragon,&quot; and it is a very dramatic painting with a lot of action in it.  First you might notice the very ferocious dragon in the lower corner with his exposed teeth and his curling pink tongue and his long tail. And then you'll see St. George on the white horse and the princess in her pink robes standing outside on top of a cave. So here we have our three major players in the story. Beyond the princess, you'll see a castle and castle walls and gardens and a moat and all the villagers locked up, safe and snug, from the dragon. And way in the top balcony, you'll see the queen and the king looking so worried for their beloved daughter. She's probably no more than 15 or 16 years-old. But look at her face. She's so serene and calm. If you were to meet a dragon, would you be so calm? I think this could be like a Hollywood action film. You have everything you need, but it's just in a single paining.</p>\n<p>Like a lot of Hollywood films, this painted story of St. George had sequels. It was once surrounded by other paintings that told further adventures in the exciting life of the saint.</p>\n",
