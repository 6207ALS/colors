An untransferred lithographic drawing in the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass. (dwg. VIII) bears a striking resemblance to this lithograph, representing a model in a nearly identical pose. The effect of the two images, however, is quite different; the drapery in the lithograph partly obscures the figure, creating a more ethereal form, whereas in the Fogg drawing the contours of the figure are clearly delineated. The model appears to be the same adolescent girl who posed for Harmony in Blue and Violet (M 1076), a pastel acquired directly from Whistler by Charles Lang Freer in 1890, now in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. T. R. Way assigned Model Draping to the year 1890 along with three other lithographs of nude or lightly draped young models (cat. 29, cat. 30, and cat. 33). However, since one of these, The Dancing Girl (cat. 29), must be redated to 1889, an earlier dating seems likely for the entire group of studies.\n\nT. R. Way published an incorrect measurement for the width of the subject in both editions of his catalogue (1896, 1905). That error, coupled with the reproduction of a graphite-signed impression in Edward Kennedy\u2019s revised catalogue (1914), led Burns A. Stubbs, when cataloging the Freer collection, to conclude that there must have been a first state with two butterflies on the stone corresponding to the dimensions provided by Way. In fact, there is only one state of this lithograph, signed only once on the stone. Variations in tone can be found from impression to impression, but these are produced by differences in inking and by the individual characteristics of the papers on which they were printed.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid paper (311 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 206 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (6), ivory laid paper (331 \u00d7 209 mm), signed; cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (249 \u00d7 192 mm), signed; cream laid paper (309\u00d7 203 mm); cream Japanese paper (312 \u00d7 213 mm); ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 207 mm). London: BM (2), grayish white chine (210 \u00d7 138 mm) mounted on white plate paper (366 \u00d7 259 mm); cream laid paper (308 \u00d7 207 mm), signed. Washington: FGA, grayish white chine (209 \u00d7 138 mm) mounted on white plate paper (382 \u00d7 279 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 206 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: A proof touched with graphite in New York, MMA, suggests that Whistler may have considered altering the image, but no changes were ever made to the stone. Other impressions are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA (2); Boston, BPL; and Cleveland, CMA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
