    "description": "<p>Celebrate Mother\u2019s Day and the return of \u201cWhistler\u2019s Mother\u201d to Chicago with this mother-and-son duo performing soulful folk music that spins tall tales about life in the Midwest.</p><p>*Ticketholders for this event may enter the museum with their event ticket beginning at 1:30. To enter earlier, please purchase a separate museum admission ticket.</p><p><strong>About the Artists</strong></p><p>At home, Madisen and Ruth Ward are family members. Onstage, they\u2019re the leading members of Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear, a band of blood relatives whose music started in Kansas City, where Madisen grew up watching his mom perform cover songs at local coffee shops. Before long, he was writing his own tunes, mixing the old-world influence of his family\u2019s folk records with the unchained, energetic stomp of modern-day rock and roll. The two began playing entire shows together, ditching the cover songs in favor of Madisen\u2019s original material. Both sang, both played guitar, and both watched as their band\u2019s audience slowly grew.</p><p>Solemn one minute and electrifying the next, Madisen Ward and Mama Bear command an audience\u2019s attention with little more than two acoustic guitars and Madisen\u2019s super-sized baritone vocals.</p><p>\u201cMost of the musicians I\u2019ve really loved have very unique and slightly awkward voices,\u201d he says, \u201cvoices that stand out among the rest. When we were playing those early shows, I\u2019d think, \u2018Belt out something that makes people set their coffee down and really pay attention. Do something to make them stop in their tracks.'\u201d</p><p>\u2028Madisen Ward and Mama Bear\u2019s songs unfold like short stories, with Madisen\u2014who grew up writing fiction\u2014preferring to cut things off before any sort of ending can be reached. The goal isn\u2019t to paint a concrete picture for the audience; it\u2019s to hand the audience the paintbrush and allow them to finish the design themselves.</p>",
