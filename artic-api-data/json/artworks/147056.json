    "description": "<p>During the winter of 42\u201341 BCE, Cleopatra became pregnant with twins. The following year, however, Antony returned to Rome and prepared a long-awaited campaign against the Parthians. Yet Octavian failed to support the endeavor. Disappointed, Antony left Italy and sailed to Alexandria, where he renewed his relationship with Cleopatra. Meanwhile, the triumvirate disintegrated, and Octavian rose to power in Rome. Eventually Antony broke off relations with Octavian, and in 31 BCE civil war broke out again. The decisive sea battle was fought at Actium, a promontory in northern Greece. As depicted in the tapestry, the Egyptian fleet was destroyed by the Romans, and Antony fled to Egypt in Cleopatra\u2019s boat. In 30 BCE, Octavian invaded Egypt. Rather than surrender to his enemy, Antony committed suicide. A few days later, Cleopatra followed his example. Their tragic deaths are not included in this suite.</p>\n",
