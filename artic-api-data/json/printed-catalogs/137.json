    "copy": " From 1948 through 1952, Yasuhiro Ishimoto studied photography at the Institute of Design in Chicago. Then he returned to Japan, to Tokyo, where he has lived ever since. Because of a continuing attachment to Chicago, however, Ishimoto has often revisited the city, most notably on a photographic fellowship in 1959\u201361. His first book, Someday, Somewhere (1958), contained many pictures from his student days, and in 1969 he published another book\u2014 Chicago, Chicago \u2014devoted solely to his adopted city.   By that time, he had also established himself as a Japanese photographer with an eye for native subjects such as Katsura Villa, on which he published a 1960 book in collaboration with architect Kenzo Tange. In recognition of his achievements in photography, Ishimoto was recently named a \"Person of Cultural Merit\" by the Japanese government. His distinguished career in Japan would, by itself, make him worthy of American attention. But his work has the double fascination that, even at its most Japanese, the influence of his education in America remains obvious.
