    "title": "A Lot of Time in A Lot of Sorrow",
    "copy": " Earlier this year, I took up residence in the Donna and Howard Stone Gallery for Film, Video, and New Media, where A Lot of Sorrow , the collaboration between Ragnar Kjartansson and The National is currently on view. My reasons for doing so were manifold. The work is new to the museum\u2019s permanent collection, and Kjartansson is having a \u201cmoment,\u201d with major exhibitions underway in the United States and abroad. The National is my favorite band working today and their record High Violet is my most faithful running partner. Most importantly, I wanted to say that I\u2019d done it\u2014after months of bugging my colleagues about the opening date and sneaking around in the gallery during installation, experiencing the work in its entirety was very much a grace note to the excitement that had been building for me for quite some time.   As his reputation has grown, a lot of ink has been rightly given to Kjartansson\u2019s practice and his exploration of the spaces where musical performance and visual art come together. Filmed in 2013 at MoMA PS1, A Lot of Sorrow is comprised of The National performing the same song, \u201cSorrow,\u201d on repeat in front of a live audience for more than six hours. Employing multiple vantage points and the occasional hand-held camera, the finished work runs on a continuous loop. Aside from (slight) changes to tempo and instrumentation, the song itself is more or less performed as written: the music never stops, the lyrics don\u2019t change, and there are no alternate versions.   Well-dressed workhorses, the band members interact with each other more or less intuitively, and there\u2019s little banter between them and the audience (although somewhere around hour four or five, the singer loses his words and the other band members step in, along with the audience). Kjartansson makes a series of appearances, first with a set list, comprised of nothing but \u201cSorrow,\u201d then with food and drinks for the band, and finally, at the end, with thanks to audience for their participation in the creation of the work. By the encore, everyone\u2014the band, the artist, and the live audience\u2014is dizzy, exhilarated, and exhausted; having just experienced the whole of the work myself, I could relate.   Research tells us that the average museum visitor spends less than 30 seconds looking at a work of art. What can be said, then, of a piece that is more durational in nature? Experiencing film, video, and new media works isn\u2019t like looking at a painting or sculpture, although some incorporate these more traditional media. This particular work is a lot of things. It\u2019s an idea, a performance, and a testimony to both. For the band, artist, and audience, their participation was about endurance; for me, it was more about patience. Watching people come in and out of the gallery from my perch in the corner became part of my experience\u2014over time, I became keenly aware of those who chose to stay, and for how long (ever competitive, I nonetheless had no concerns that they would outlast me). If so inclined, you could listen to the song 105 times (yes, I counted) over the course of the day, but it\u2019s not the same. In the end, what is so wonderful about A Lot of Sorrow is that it doesn\u2019t set the terms of your engagement, and while you don\u2019t have to view it in its entirety to experience it fully, doing so is a worthy exercise. A Lot of Sorrow has been extended through October 16th, so there\u2019s still time to experience some (or all) of the exhibition for yourself. If you\u2019re interested in joining me among the ranks of those who have seen it in its entirety, you can swing by on a Thursday, around 1:45 p.m., when the work is restarted from the beginning. Look for me in the corner, with the red hair. \u2014Jennifer Oatess, Director, Foundation and Government Grants ",
