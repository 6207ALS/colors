    "description": "<p>The New York World\u2019s Fair, which opened in New York City in 1939, was organized around the theme, \u201cbuilding the world of tomorrow.\u201d In seven zones\u2014Amusement, Food, Communications and Business Systems, Community Interests, International Affairs, Production and Distribution, and Transportation\u2014modern achievements of the 20th century and proposed visions of the future were presented to an international audience. The fair\u2019s avant-garde aesthetic style received particular acclaim, as seen through the work of such architects and designers as Norman Bel Geddes, Delano and Aldrich, Donald Deskey, Harrison and Fouilhoux, Albert Kahn, and Gilbert Rohde. This collection of press releases, published materials, ephemera, and photographs documents many of the exhibitions and activities of the fair.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/New%20York%20World's%20Fair%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/New%20York%20World's%20Fair%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View entirely digitized collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/new%20york%20world%27s%20fair/field/title/mode/all/conn/or/order/title\">Find all New York World\u2019s Fair digital images.</a></p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"\">[page name]</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
