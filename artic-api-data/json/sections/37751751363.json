E. Bensinger, 1969.870R, 1969.870V\n\nIntended as illustrations for \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette,\u201d a story written by his brother Edmond, Renoir made these drawings in the south of France where they traveled together in 1881. Although Renoir claimed to dislike depicting men, preferring to work with female models, these sheets prove his conversance with the visual language of masculinity. In the first of the two drawings, On the Terrace of a Hotel in Bordighera: The Painter Jean Martin Reviews His Bill (cat. 12), the artist depicted his sitter lounging elegantly on a summer chair, dressed in fashionable loose trousers, with his cap balanced perfectly on his proper right leg. Made to accompany the opening passages of the story, the illustration introduces the main character, Jean Martin, and sets the scene by the sea.\n\nThe drawing shows Jean Martin as he tries to make sense of an itemized check. Renoir captures the momentary surprise on his face as he puzzles over a particular item. \u201cWhat could that be? . . . Paper, 3.75 [francs]?\u201d On realizing it was a charge for writing paper, \u201cthe oddity of the invention made him smile.\u201d The image conveys the character\u2019s impeccable manners; money matters do not ruffle his composure. Essentially, \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d is a story of mistaken identity. Jean Martin\u2019s demeanor persuades onlookers of his royal breeding. They assume he is a prince traveling incognito, though he is actually a painter. But the underlying message of the drawing\u2014and of the tale itself\u2014is surely that the Renoir brothers had a high opinion of their artistic vocations.\n\nThe making of this drawing was a case of life imitating art. It was Edmond himself who posed for the work, in the garden of a hotel in Menton, situated on the French Riviera. Over the course of the vacation, Renoir was very taken with the region and enthused about the light and scenery. Nonetheless, however much he garnered from his immediate experience, he depicted almost all of the details in the image in accordance with the details of his brother\u2019s narrative. Edmond had described his protagonist, Jean Martin, as handsome and about thirty years old. His face was \u201copen, intelligent, pleasant, . . . of a beauty quite rare for a man, in that it didn\u2019t render him ridiculous. The shape of his face, a well-drawn oval, framed black eyes topped with rather arched eyebrows, a straight nose, a naturally smiling mouth adorned with a dark brown moustache . . . cared for enough to show that an effort had been made, but neglected enough so as to in no way infer an excess of vanity on the part of its owner.\u201d It is unclear, however, whether Edmond had identified with his creation to the extent that he was the obvious model, or whether (more prosaically), the choice was one of convenience. Perhaps the latter is the more plausible answer; Edmond posed often for his brother. Most famously he sat as the male figure in La loge (fig. 1 [Daulte 119; Dauberville 262]) who assesses the auditorium through a lorgnette.\n\nThe first installment of the serially published \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d appeared in La vie moderne in December 1883.La vie moderne\u2014intended to champion the Impressionists\u2014was funded initially by Renoir\u2019s patrons Georges and Marguerite Charpentier. The Charpentiers\u2019 tastes were broad, and they welcomed young people from the worlds of art and literature into their home each week. They also allowed artists to exhibit their work in the offices of the magazine. It was there that Renoir had his first solo show. At this time Edmond wrote a defense of his brother\u2019s art for the journal, praising the way it captured the softer, more poetic side of contemporary life. Shortly thereafter he became editor-in-chief of the publication.\n\nIn later life, Renoir recalled that Madame Charpentier\u2014a formidable woman\u2014had persuaded her husband to back La vie moderne. It is hard to underestimate the gratitude that the artist felt toward his sponsors at this stage of his career; his large-scale portrait of Madame Charpentier and her children (fig. 2 [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]) had been a resounding success and won him considerable acclaim. The painting hung in a prime spot at the Salon of 1879, reflecting not only its merits but also the influence and popularity of Renoir\u2019s patron. \u201cIf one day I succeed,\u201d Renoir wrote to Georges Charpentier, \u201cit will be entirely thanks to her [Marguerite], because I would certainly have been incapable of doing so on my own.\u201d\n\nThe drawing of Jean Martin, however, has a very different status and function than the grandiose canvas. It was designed for practical use, employing clear tonal contrasts in order to reproduce well in print. The lines that constitute the figure and surroundings are fine and controlled, while a series of loose marks at the bottom of the sheet (including looping circles and haphazard vertical dashes) show how Renoir avoided overloading the nib and brush. He defined most elements of the scene in ink but sporadically added passages of Cont\u00e9 crayon. The resistance provided by the heavy laid paper added character to his shading. As the waxy medium adhered unevenly to the textured support\u2014in areas including the body of Jean Martin\u2019s jacket\u2014it created automatic tonal variation.\n\nThe second of the drawings, The Descent from the Summit: Jean Martin Steadies H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the Banker\u2019s Daughter, was published to illustrate an episode in the next installment of \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette.\u201d Jean Martin accompanies his sweetheart on a country stroll, perhaps steadying her as they walk, although the text does not specify this. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s father disapproves of his daughter\u2019s attachment to a painter, but as a socially ambitious banker, he is charmed when he meets by the supposed prince and encourages the alliance. This misunderstanding makes for a happy\u2014if predictable\u2014conclusion. The young couple gains parental blessing even after the confusion clears. More interesting, however, is the triumph of the princely painter as a reflection of Renoir\u2019s own social ambitions. Paul C\u00e9zanne, for one, had noticed that the artist was moving in all the right circles at this stage of his career.\n\nOn a compositional level, Renoir seems to have based the drawing on a painting he made in 1870, La promenade (fig. 3 [Daulte 55; Dauberville 257]). For the illustration, however, the artist reversed the placement of the figures. Whether intentionally or not, this changed the dynamic of the scene; a satyr-like man leads a reluctant woman into the woods in La promenade, while in the drawing, the female figure may take the lead. Given that nineteenth-century French artists often placed amorous scenes in country settings, as if to distance them from the constraints of bourgeois domesticity, the suggestion that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne encourages Jean Martin would have been risqu\u00e9. That the image appeared as an illustration, however, lessened its potential to cause offense. Readers of popular magazines were relatively tolerant of sous-entendre.\n\nIt is worth noting that in the 1930s critics identified the sitter in On the Terrace as Paul Lhote. Lively and handsome, Lhote was a good friend of the artist and had posed for other works including City Dance (1883; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Dauberville 1000]) and Country Dance (fig. 4 [Dauberville 999]). Paul Lhote and Edmond appear to have been of a similar build, with smooth hair and delicate features, but this confusion may also indicate that, just as Renoir had fixed ideas about female physiognomy, he tended toward a generic type in his depictions of men.\n\nIt is rather curious that, in speaking of his work for La vie moderne, Renoir complained that he had needed to adapt his methods to suit the materials the publishers provided. \u201cThe worst thing of all was that, for our drawings, they made us work on the most disagreeable of papers. You had to use a scraper to produce the whites,\u201d he grumbled to his dealer, Ambroise Vollard. \u201cI never was able to do it.\u201d The paper type is unremarkable in the drawings for \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d (see cat. 12 Support Characteristics and cat. 13 Support Characteristics) so the comment cannot relate to the sheets in the collection of the Art Institute.\n\nOn a financial level, however, La vie moderne generated problems for its contributors. It was hardly a profitable enterprise. \u201cWe all collaborated,\u201d Renoir explained to Vollard. \u201cWe were to be paid out of the profits to come, that\u2019s to say, not one of us got a single sou.\u201d\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">On the Terrace of a Hotel in Bordighera: The Painter Jean Martin Reviews His Bill (Illustration for Edmond Renoir\u2019s \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d) corresponds to Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, with the collaboration of Camille Fr\u00e9montier-Murphy, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vol. 1, 1858\u20131881 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007), p. 621, no. 672 (ill.).\n\nThe Descent from the Summit: Jean Martin Steadies H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, the Banker\u2019s Daughter (Illustration for Edmond Renoir\u2019s \u201cL\u2019\u00e9tiquette\u201d) corresponds to Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, with the collaboration of Camille Fr\u00e9montier-Murphy, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vol. 1, 1858\u20131881 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007), p. 612, no. 658 (ill.).\n\nJean Renoir, My Father, trans.
