During his first months there, he purposefully restrained from executing paintings, intent upon learning as much as he could about the island\u2019s people and topography by drawing incessantly, whether on individual sheets or in sketchbooks. His charcoal heads are studies of figures that interested him, although one (cat. 49) can be regarded as a true portrait, since it relates to a depiction in oil of the young woman Gauguin was living with (cat. 50). For the most part, these images reveal the artist abstracting facial features, generalizing countenances rather than individualizing them.\n\nThe pupil-less eyes, simplified shape of the eyebrows, and the regularized contour of the man in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing contribute to the masklike quality of the image. The head displays a kinship with a bust-length likeness in oil of an unidentified male sitter, whose facial features are somewhat like those of the subject of the drawing (fig. 45.2 [W 422]). The sitter in the painting, his face turned to the left, seems to have dressed up for his sitting; he wears a pink shirt and blue cravat and has decorated himself further with flowers at his left ear (among them a gardenia).\n\nThe head in profile to the left of the charcoal Tahitian male is related to the seated figure in profile depicted in an 1897 oil painting, Te rerioa (The Dream) (fig. 45.3 [W 557]), although the latter faces in the opposite direction. The Chicago drawing brings to mind various depictions of Tahitian male types by Gauguin (see fig. 45.4) and by other artists working in the early twentieth century, such as Walker Evans. Indeed, the title Evans gave to a 1932 photograph of a man\u2014Tahiti\u2014distances the image from the particular individual it represents (fig. 45.5).\n\nThe sheet\u2019s verso (see fig. 45.1) is a figure study for Gauguin\u2019s 1892 oil painting Tahitian Landscape (fig. 45.6 [W 442]).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">This powerful study of a Tahitian male head is virtually unique in Gauguin\u2019s drawn oeuvre. Fascinated by the serene and contemplative Tahitian women, Gauguin created more monumental portrait drawings of them than of native men. This sheet shares the large scale of his female head studies (see cat. 49), but it distinguishes itself from the group in being the only known male portrait head and in displaying a distinctly different handling of materials. Whereas the female head studies are notable for a rich application of charcoal and black chalk with sometimes rigorous stumping, here Gauguin intermingled red chalk with black chalk, selectively stumping the figure\u2019s face and hair. He established preliminary lines with black and red chalk and reinforced the defining lines of the face with black chalk. Touches of red chalk enhance the man\u2019s lips. Pentimenti reveal an adjustment of the figure\u2019s jaw line, and an old fold may reflect a desire to trim the sheet.\n\nThe features of this head have been compared to a relatively early, undated oil portrait ([fig. 45.7 [W 422]) tentatively identified as Anani, Gauguin\u2019s landlord and neighbor in Mataiea, or Jot\u00e9pha, who helped the artist find wood to make sculpture. But neither identification can be confirmed with certainty. The artist seems not to have used this drawing as the basis for any paintings. He might have intended this drawing, with its impressive scale and degree of finish, for exhibition as an independent work of art, although he declared that his drawings were private, for him. Indeed, its commanding presence explains why it was one of four works by Gauguin included in the 1913 Armory Show, which traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago (see fig. 45.8).\n\nLike several of the large charcoal-and-black-chalk female heads, the frontal portrayal here is accompanied by a slight profile to the left (see, for example, fig. 45.9 [Rewald 119] and fig. 45.10). The turned-up nose and receding chin of the profile on the present sheet, so effortlessly and persuasively conveyed with a simple contour line, suggests it is another figure and not a second view of the main protagonist. Gauguin\u2019s effective circumscription of a profile with a few swelling lines can be seen also in a contemporary sheet, Studies of Striding Figures, Costumes, and the Head in Profile of a Tahitian (fig. 45.11).\n\nThe verso of the sheet features studies of two standing figures: a hand and the eyes, brow, and nose of a head turned in a three-quarters view to the right. Although Gauguin seems to have tended to leave eyes undefined (see cat. 32), in this brief sketch, the eyeball is distinctly visible. The two standing Tahitian figures are juxtaposed\u2014one facing forward, the other with her back mostly turned, as they would appear (even closer together) in the 1892 painting Tahitian Landscape (fig. 45.12 [W 442]). A second attempt at the hand of one of the figures reveals Gauguin sensitivity to the accuracy of small details. There are touches of red and blue watercolor on the verso that do not seem to relate to the drawn figures\u2014this color may be off-set from another sheet. Gauguin later turned the sheet over to execute the more finished drawing on the recto. The sheet was folded, just below the chin of the forward facing man. This folding may have been done by Gauguin, or by a later collector, to frame the composition differently or mark where the sheet may be trimmed.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Emily Crane Chadbourne (1871\u20131964), London and Chicago, by 1910.\n\nGiven by Emily Crane Chadbourne to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, no cat. no.\n\nNew York, 69th Regiment Armory, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Feb. 17\u2013Mar. 15, 1913, cat. 177.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Mar. 24\u2013Apr. 16, 1913, cat. 140.\n\nCopley Society of Boston, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Apr. 28\u2013May 19, 1913, cat. 57.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 875.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., A Loan Exhibition of Paul Gauguin, for the Benefit of the New York Infirmary, Apr. 3\u2013May 4, 1946, cat. 49.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Gauguin: Loan Exhibition for the Benefit of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York City, Inc., Apr. 5\u2013May 5, 1956, cat. 62.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture, Feb. 12\u2013Mar. 29, 1959, cat. 98; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Apr. 21\u2013May 31, 1959.\n\nMunich, Haus der Kunst, Paul Gauguin, Apr. 1\u2013May 29, 1960, cat. 108, pl. 65\n\nVienna, \u00d6sterreichische Galerie im Oberen Belvedere, Paul Gauguin, June 7\u2013July 31, 1960, cat. 55, pl. 27.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Master Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago: An Exhibition Held at Wildenstein, Oct. 17\u2013Nov. 30, 1963, cat. 116.\n\nKrannert Art Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Drawings from the Collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 23\u2013May 14, 1972, no cat. no.\n\nPalm Beach, Fla., Society of Four Arts, Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago, Jan. 5\u201327, 1974, cat. 19.\n\nParis, Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Dessins fran\u00e7ais de l\u2019Art Institute de Chicago de Watteau \u00e0 Picasso, Oct. 15, 1976\u2013Jan. 17, 1977, cat. 72 (ill.); Frankfurt am Main, St\u00e4dtische Galerie im St\u00e4delschen Kunstinstitut, Feb. 10\u2013Apr. 10, 1977, cat. 73 (ill.).\n\nWashington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 122 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, as Gauguin, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Washington, D.C., and Chicago only).\n\nStaatsgalerie Stuttgart, Paul Gauguin: Tahiti, Feb. 7\u2013June 1, 1998, cat. 22 (ill.).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, exh. cat.
