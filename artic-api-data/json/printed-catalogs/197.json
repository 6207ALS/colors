    "copy": " This stunning volume includes more than 75 works of traditional African art in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection from regions across the continent and in a wide variety of media. Essays and catalogue entries by leading art historians and anthropologists examine their meanings and materials in addition to fleshing out the original contexts of their production and use. These experts also underscore the ways in which provenance and collection history are important to understanding how we view such objects today. Celebrating the Art Institute\u2019s collection of traditional African art as one of the oldest and most diverse in the United States, this publication offers a fresh and engaging look at current research into the arts of Africa as well as the potential of future scholarship.
