All materials will be provided.</p><p>Drawing is an intimate act. It is linked to the very gestures of the body: the hand as it moves across the paper, the eye as it caresses the subject it observes. Inspired by the exhibition <em>Manet and Modern Beauty</em>, draw from artworks that capture intimate moments and experiment with drawing techniques that help communicate such intimacy.&nbsp;</p><p>About the Instructor<br>Leslie Baum is a painter and a museum educator with 25 years of teaching experience.
