    "description": "<p>Artists Rodney McMillian and Julia Fish join exhibition co-curator Caitlin Haskell, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, in conversation about <em>Cezanne</em>.</p><p>Cezanne sought to develop a visual language that could fully translate his intense feelings into paintings. In doing so, he opened up possibilities that were embraced and elaborated by artists in his time and into the present. Julia Fish and Rodney McMillian, both of whom contributed to the exhibition catalogue, will explore Cezanne's art-making practice and why it continues to resonate.</p><h2>About the Speakers </h2><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong> In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination, though anyone who would like to wear a mask is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 in the week before your visit, we ask that you stay home.&nbsp;We appreciate your help in keeping the museum a healthy and safe place for our staff and visitors.
