    "description": "<p>\u201cWater is Precious Use It Wisely,\u201d declares the headline in a newspaper clipping at the top of this work by Ray Johnson. The line adds a playful if ambiguous twist to the manipulated photograph below it\u2014<a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33885/henri-cartier-bresson\">Henri Cartier-Bresson</a>\u2019s <em>Brussels</em> (1932)\u2014encouraging us to read the two men pressed against a wall as, possibly, urinating. Extending the game of joke by juxtaposition, Johnson situated the upper bodies of these men atop the lower torsos and legs of three men carrying Western-style handgun holsters. Above the men, in the collage\u2019s top right corner, Johnson planted a more oblique reference to water: a fragment of a flyer that he designed with small silhouetted forms he called <em>moticos</em>. Johnson coined this term in 1955 and applied it to a variety of experimental works he was making from complete collages to their component parts. The term is an anagram of the word <em>osmotic</em>, which describes the movement of fluid across a membrane. Johnson\u2019s collaged headline thus slyly references the presence (and preciousness) of water as a central metaphor within his practice.</p>\n",
