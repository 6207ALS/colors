    "copy": " Bishal (Bhaikaji) Manandhar is a Chicago-based multidisciplinary visual artist from Nepal. Through his artwork he elevates mundane objects to a higher level and attempts to appreciate the beauty of these materials. Although painting has been his main artistic medium, he has recently become interested in working with materials that are neglected in daily life. He graduated from the School of the Art Institute (SAIC) in fall 2019 and had two group exhibitions in 2020. During this time, Manandhar also worked for artist Michael Rakowitz as an assistant on a major project. Manandhar is currently working at SAIC in the Instructional Resources and Facilities Management department as a supervisor of the 280 Woodshop. He is also in the planning stages of a large multi-faceted investigative research project about stolen artifacts from Nepal that will examine how sacred objects and important cultural works end up in various museums and private collections around the world.
