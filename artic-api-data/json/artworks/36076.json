    "description": "<p>This sampler commemorates the deaths of Nicholas (1767\u20131797) and Mary Bullock (?-1802). It is likely that is was stitched by either Mary or Louise (Louisa) Winsor, daughters of Mary Bullock Winsor (1767-1816) and Nicholas Winsor (1767-1797). The family connection and style of this piece, and other related works, link it to Mary Balch\u2019s school in Providence. The inclusion of the trumpeting angels indicates that this piece is among the earliest mourning embroideries made at the school. Silk on silk embroidery demonstrated advances needlework skills for a young women. This memorial sampler, along with other types of mourning art, is not a morbid tribute, but rather a beautiful and sophisticated expression of sentiment for the dearly departed.</p>\n",
