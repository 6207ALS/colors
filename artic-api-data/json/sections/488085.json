These Greek portrait types, the majority of which are preserved in examples of Roman date, were later used to adorn the homes of the wealthy, elite Romans. Frequently displayed in lavish villas in galleries of famous Greek cultural and intellectual figures\u2014including Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Menander, Epicurus, and others\u2014Greek philosopher portraits were intended to reflect the patron\u2019s erudition and prestige.\n\nThis life-size portrait head (fig. 19.1 and fig. 19.2), which depicts a bearded, mature man, bears the hallmarks of these popular philosopher portraits: a naturally arranged hairstyle and beard, the latter in wavy, thick locks; a mature but largely unlined visage; and deep-set eyes under heavy lids, giving the subject a remote expression. In this regard, it bears a general similarity to portraits of the philosophers of the Epicurean school, including Epicurus himself (342/341\u2013271/270 B.C.) and his pupils Metrodorus (331/330\u2013278/277 B.C.) and Hermarchus (c. 340\u2013after 270 B.C.). While there are some formal differences among the types associated with each philosopher, which are intended to suggest their individual likenesses, they are nevertheless characterized by a similar overall look that might have signaled the spiritual continuity from Epicurus to his students. The official portraits of the Epicurean philosophers are recognized in part by their elegant, finely groomed appearance, including their wavy, carefully arranged locks of hair over the forehead as well as their well-tended beards, features that were associated with the image of the classical Athenian citizen.\n\nIn particular, this portrait most closely resembles the images of Metrodorus, who was renowned for his serenity and good-natured temperament. His likeness is distinguished by its somewhat youthful face (which is typically unlined aside from a slight furrow over the forehead), placid expression, and neatly groomed hair and beard, as seen in a double portrait herm depicting Metrodorus and Epicurus in Rome (fig. 19.3).\n\nUpon further examination, it is apparent that the Chicago portrait might have suffered some damage in antiquity, as evidenced by numerous lacunae at the back of the head as well as a large crack running over the proper left side of the hairline (fig. 19.4). This damage might have required a phase of ancient reworking to mitigate its effect on the portrait\u2019s appearance. In particular, the sideburns and beard appear as if their volume might have been reduced. The lower relief of the locks is particularly apparent in the facial hair on the proper left side, which still contains traces of brown accretions that were possibly from burial or weathering (fig. 19.5). It is possible that the beard previously might have had a fuller, more generous appearance, similar to what one finds in this profile view of the aforementioned portrait of Metrodorus in Rome (fig. 19.6).\n\nIt is unclear whether this possible phase of ancient intervention also resulted in the updating of the appearance of the eyes with the drilling of the pupils and the incising of the irises. Root marks in the proper left pupil indicate the antiquity of this feature, although signs of modern resharpening are apparent in the inner corners of the eyes and the edges of the eyelids (fig. 19.7). Drilled eyes were a common feature of Roman portraits from A.D. 130 onward, yet they are employed less frequently in portraits of Greek philosophers. As Sheila Dillon argued, the use of such technical features, including drilled eyes and highly polished surfaces representing flesh, were often omitted from portraits of Greek philosophers in order to avoid a contemporary appearance. However, examples that include such technical refinements are attested, as seen in a portrait of Plato in Rome (fig. 19.8). While it is unclear whether the drilled eyes in the Chicago portrait are original to it or part of a later (but still ancient) intervention, they nevertheless indicate that the portrait was in existence at some point after the late Hadrianic period, likely in the second half of the second century.\n\nThe portrait also underwent a more aggressive phase of modern intervention before its acquisition in 1923, which is particularly apparent in the hairstyle, not only in the locks over the forehead and in parts of the crown but also at the sides of the head, particularly behind the ears. While the fringe of hair over the forehead is handled with some subtlety, the locks behind the ears and at the back of the head are very roughly worked (fig. 19.9). In these areas, the marble is much brighter white and is lacking the ocher tonality that one finds in the lower half of the head, as is particularly evident in a view of the proper right side (fig. 19.10). Additionally, the portrait underwent a repair in 1923 to the lower part of the beard at the chin, which is known to have broken off at some point after its arrival, further complicating our understanding of its former appearance.\n\nThus, with its well-tended beard, serene expression, and thoughtful, deep-set eyes, this portrait clearly conveys an image of a mature Greek philosopher. However, it remains to be seen whether it originally depicted a renowned philosopher, such as Metrodorus, or one of the many unidentified intellectuals represented in only a single likeness.  \nKatharine A.

Jane Fejfer suggested that the carving of the iris and pupils \u201cappeared tentatively\u201d during the early part of the Hadrianic period; see Fejfer, Roman Portraits in Context, p. 278. Dillon acknowledged that her argument regarding the use of contemporary Roman sculptural techniques in portraits of Greek philosophers contrasts with that of much contemporary German scholarship on the topic, particularly that of Paul Zanker, who argued instead that sculptors employed the \u201cperiod-face\u201d (Zeitgesicht) of the age in Greek philosopher portraits; see Dillon, Ancient Greek Portrait Sculpture, pp. 2, 173 n. 4; Zanker, Mask of Socrates, pp. 13\u201314.
