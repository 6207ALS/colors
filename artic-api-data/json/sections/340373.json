It is one of two portraits that must have been drawn in a single sitting (see also cat. 110). Portrait of Dr. Whistler, No. 2 is the more elaborately drawn and finished of the two. There is no evidence to suggest which drawing was created first; Whistler\u2019s use of numbers in his titles generally indicates his preference rather than the order in which the works were produced.\n\nBoth portraits were drawn on the same type of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, identifiable by the presence of two parallel lines, spaced 85 mm apart, resulting from creases in a batch of this thin, transparent transfer paper that had recently been prepared for the artist by the Lemercier firm (see also cat. 107, cat. 108, cat. 109, cat. 110, cat. 112, and cat. 115).\n\nAs in the case of The Doctor, the transfer drawing for this image was set aside rather than sent immediately to London for transferring by the Ways. In late October, almost a month after the two portraits were drawn, Beatrix Whistler mailed them to the printers. Whistler was pleased with the first proofs and wished to order additional impressions, although he regretted the fact that they had not been transferred sooner: \u201cAnd for the present 6 more of the Doctor in the finished chair\u2014Of this you seem to have sent me only 2 proofs\u2014you must have meant to send 3 as you did of the other. I like the drawing much\u2014and if I had sent it to you when fresh I think the head would have come out perfectly\u2014The nose is excellent\u2014only the eyes seem not to have taken\u2014The hands would have been charming if the drawing had not been kicking about in neglect, so that some of the sharpness has gone now\u201d (letter 128).\n\nWhen a drawing on lithographic transfer paper is not transferred promptly, the grease from the crayon begins to dry on the surface of the transfer paper and fails to migrate successfully to the stone. As a result, the drawn lines often fail to transfer completely. In Portrait of Dr. Whistler, No. 2, such losses are obvious in the sitter\u2019s face and in the objects on his lap, making these areas difficult to read. Indeed, T. R. Way (1905) mistook the large glass in Dr. Whistler\u2019s hand and the napkin on his lap for \u201ca little white dog on the doctor\u2019s right knee.\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC, grayish ivory laid proofing paper (276 \u00d7 215 mm), signed; MWC, grayish ivory chine (202 \u00d7 160 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (345 \u00d7 251 mm); SC, ivory laid paper (324 \u00d7 205 mm).
