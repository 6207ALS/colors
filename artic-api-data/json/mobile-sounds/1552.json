    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Elegantly silhouetted against a green interior, Comte de Pastoret surveys the world with an air of superiority in this portrait by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: Well, I think it's interesting, when this was exhibited officially right after he painted it, people thought that he looked dead, that he was lifeless, and they made fun not only of the way it was painted, but of the sitter. This is a portrait of a man who thinks he's very important, and you can see that in his kind of swagger pose and the way he's showing off everything. I mean, if you look at his legendenere, [ph?] he's got that cross, and then he's got this wonderful alabaster and gold sword hilt, and then he has these wonderful kid gloves next to him. It's very symbiotic, their relationship, because Ingres painted him at a time when this fellow had helped him get into an important academy, and at the same time, the Count was looking to Ingres to help him confirm his place in the art and literature world, so he was very anxious to be portrayed by an artist who was so well respected.</p>\n",
