    "description": "<p>One of the most exciting designers working today, Max Lamb has received international acclaim for his innovative experiments with\u00a0materials, craft, and technology. Drawn to the form of the chair and its relationship to the human body, Lamb has explored many different\u00a0inventive outcomes in his ever-evolving\u00a0Exercises in Seating\u00a0project.\u00a0 This book investigates over a decade of creative practice with a focus on his interest in seating\u2014from stone thrones to wood chairs and enameled-steel\u00a0stools. In Lamb\u2019s own words, \u201cA seat is very simple in function, but very complex in the many different characters, forms, and ideas it can express.\u201d\u00a0 Both retrospective and forward looking, this volume\u2014created in collaboration with the artist\u2014is the most thorough investigation of Lamb\u2019s work to date and features an exclusive interview with noted artist Ryan\u00a0Gander in which the designer discusses his creative processes and goals.\u00a0</p><p>Softcover, 8 1/4\" x 11 11/16\" x 3/8\", 128 pages with 145 color illustrations</p>",
