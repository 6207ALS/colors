These demands\u2014generally known as the \u201cAlabama Claims\u201d in reference to the most successful of these vessels, the CSS Alabama\u2014ordered Britain to compensate the United States for direct and indirect damages, including the pursuit and destruction of Union ships and the prolongment of the war. The two governments agreed to have the case arbitrated by dignitaries from three neutral countries. The tribunal took place over the course of thirty-two conferences held between 1871 and 1872 in Geneva, Switzerland, and included agents from the United States and Britain, who presented their arguments before the arbitrators: Count Federico Sclopis, Italian Minister of State; Jacques Stampfli, President of the Swiss Confederation; and Marcos Antonio de Araujo, Viscount d\u2019Itajub\u00e1 of Brazil. On September 14, 1872, the tribunal found Britain guilty of direct damages to American ships and cargoes, ordering it to pay reparations in the amount of $15.5 million (over $300 million in today\u2019s terms).\n\nThis suite of presentation silver is one of the three identical sets the U.S. government commissioned in gratitude to the members of the tribunal. The design program is based on a revival style popularized in the mid-nineteenth century, based on myths and symbols from ancient Greece. The handles of the punch bowl represent Dionysus, the god of wine and festivity, depicted as a youthful figure crowned with grape leaves and wearing a lion skin (see fig. 1). A cast band of vines winds around the body of the bowl, and the theme of frenzied celebration carries into the ribbon-tied cymbals and tambourines that encircle the base. The four feet of the bowl, like those of the candelabra, rest on the paws of heroically crowned lions. Both wine coolers, which also stand on lion\u2019s paws, bear a chased plaque of a Greek goddess in flowing drapery. One shows Demeter, the patroness of agriculture, holding a plow in her left hand and a sheaf of wheat in her right (see fig. 2). She is accompanied on the other wine cooler by the personification of Commerce, who holds both an anchor and a globe with signs of the zodiac. Ariadne, the wife of Dionysus, supports each candelabrum (see fig. 3).\n\nAs indicated by the initials EJS appearing on the base to the left of each figure, these garnitures were designed by Eugene J. Soligny, one of Tiffany &amp; Co.\u2019s foremost chasers. Archival documents note that, like the interior of the bowl, the Ariadne figures and the plaques with Commerce and Agriculture were partially gilded, adding to the contrasting surfaces that appear throughout the service. In addition to the gold wash on some areas, a combination of oxidized surfaces and satin finishes creates a rich tapestry of effects throughout the set.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s suite is the first of the Geneva tribunal services produced by Tiffany, attested by the No. 1 stamped on the underside of one foot on each object. Though all three were shipped abroad at the same time, this suite was the only one presented in a formal ceremony; in this case, the U.S. Minister to France, Elihu B. Washburne, offered it to the Viscount d\u2019Itajub\u00e1 in Paris in 1873. The U.S. Secretary of State, Hamilton Fish, instructed Washburne to\n\npresent them to [Viscount d\u2019Itajub\u00e1] in the name of the United States as a mark of their appreciation of the dignity, ability, learning and impartiality with which he discharged his arduous duties at Geneva, and as an expression of the President\u2019s deep sense of the unselfishness with which he devoted his time and his great abilities to the solution of the difficult questions which had then arisen between Her Britannic Majesty and the United States, and which are now so happily laid at rest by the Action of the Tribunal of Arbitration of which the Viscount d\u2019Itajuba was so distinguished a member.\n\nThe viscount accepted the service graciously as a \u201cnever failing remembrance\u201d of his participation in the historical proceedings.\n\nEarlier, one of the silver suites was displayed at the 1873 Vienna International Exposition, where it received widespread attention in the press. In a news report of the extraordinary gifts bestowed upon the arbitrators, the service was deemed a gesture \u201cworthy of our standing as a nation . . . [one that] would reflect credit upon us wherever it went.\u201d The lengthy account praised not only the extraordinary design of each object and the designer\u2019s keen sense of the possibilities for silver, but also the \u201cexquisite workmanship\u201d evident in their execution. According to the writer, \u201cEvery detail of the work is, in fact, as near perfection as it can be brought. Thus whether we compare these services with what Tiffany has done already, or what has come to America from foreign countries, the general verdict will be that in these articles he is unsurpassed.\u201d\n\nCertainly, no expense was spared. Tiffany\u2019s records show that at the time, each of the five-piece services cost over $2,000 (roughly equal to $40,000 in today\u2019s terms) to produce. As remarkable for the circumstances of its commission as for its intricate design and deft execution, the Geneva tribunal service is a tour de force in American silver and one of the most important presentation suites of the nineteenth century.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">For a complete account of the tribunal, see US Department of State (1873\u201374), vol. 4, pp. 1\u2013551.
