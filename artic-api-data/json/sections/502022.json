Politics, domestic drama, and myth come together in a remarkable way on this coin.\n\nAfter the battle of Philippi in 42 B.C., Octavian and Mark Antony divided the empire between them, sidelining the third triumvir, Lepidus. Antony retained command in the East; Octavian held Rome. Tension between them was aggravated by the maneuvers of a remarkable woman: Fulvia, Antony\u2019s wife, who waged war in Italy against Octavian. To complicate matters, Fulvia\u2019s daughter Clodia was Octavian\u2019s wife. Antony and Octavian met to defuse the situation, resulting in the Treaty of Brindisium in 40 B.C. As part of the accord, Octavian divorced Clodia; Antony, free of Fulvia (who had conveniently just died), married Octavian\u2019s sister Octavia. The new happy couple returned to Athens, where Antony assumed the persona of New Dionysos, as had Hellenistic kings before him. Coins struck by Antony in the East present him as the beautiful young god whose death and rebirth was celebrated in the Dionysian Mysteries, and Octavia was his Ariadne. Octavia is probably the first actual Roman woman presented on a coin.\n\nThe obverse shows Antony\u2019s chiseled features crowned by ivy while on the reverse, Octavia\u2019s head floats eerily over the cista mystica\u2014the chest or basket that held snakes for the sacred rituals. The juxtaposition of the proper and decorous Octavia with the Bacchic Mysteries must have shocked Romans and thrilled Greeks. Shortly after this coin was minted, however, Antony resumed his relationship with Cleopatra VII of Egypt, and in 32 B.C. he divorced Octavia and sent agents to evict her from their home in Rome; the insult spurred her brother Octavian to read Antony\u2019s will in public, revealing Antony\u2019s intention to make Cleopatra and her sons his heirs. The battle of Actium would follow in a matter of months.\n\nThe obverse inscription\u2014in Latin, not Greek\u2014advertises Antony as imperator and as consul designate for the second (ITER[um]) and third (TERT[ius]) times. The designated consulships help to date this coin, since they were awarded in the Pact of Misenum (39 B.C.) at which Antony, Octavian, and Sextus Pompeius (see cat. 32, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Pompey the Great) brokered a power-sharing arrangement and agreed on the consulships for the coming years. The lituus below identifies him as augur. The reverse legend proclaims him triumvir rei publicae constituendae, \u201cone of three men for [re]establishing the Republic.\u201d But it was an empty phrase. By this date, Lepidus was out, Octavian had distanced himself from the triumvirate, and none of them had plans to reconstitute the Republic.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Alexander the Great introduced a unified coinage based on the Athenian standard, but his successors tended to reduce the weight of his tetradrachm. The Attalid kings of Pergamum after 166 B.C. used the Ptolemaic standard of three drachms of silver in a new four-drachm denomination, called the \u201ccistophore\u201d because of the image of a cista mystica on the coin. See Kleiner and Noe, Early Cistophoric Coinage, esp. p. 125.\n\nWood, Imperial Women, pp. 43\u201351.\n\nBacchic rites had been outlawed in Rome in 186 B.C. (Livy, History of Rome 39.8\u201319); but by the time of Julius Caesar the mysteries were gaining interest again. See Kraemer, Her Share of the Blessings, esp. pp. 43\u201345.\n\nWood, Imperial Women, pp. 31\u201332. After Antony\u2019s death Octavia raised her own children and those of Antony with Fulvia and with Cleopatra as well.\n\nSee Appian, Civil Wars 5.73. The circumstances, first of Antony\u2019s campaign in Parthia, and then of his war with Octavian, prevented him from taking up the office either time. On the dating of the coin, see Wood, Imperial Women, p. 45.\n\nHe was appointed an augur in 49 B.C. For the importance of this position, see cat. 32, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Pompey the Great.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 33 Cistophoric Tetradrachm (Coin) Portraying Mark Antony, 39/38 B.C.\n\n</section>",
