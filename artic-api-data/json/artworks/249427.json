    "description": "<p>Ellen Emmet Rand worked principally as a portraitist. Yet <em>Woman before the Mirror</em> is instead a dynamic figure study, showcasing her assured brushwork and vibrant palette. Executed in 1925, the painting demonstrates the artist\u2019s interest in elements both old and new: The figure wears 19th-century dress, which Rand rendered in a painterly realism inspired by Spanish Baroque artist Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. The woman\u2019s intense gaze in reflection, however, suggests an assertive self-presentation that is decidedly modern. A trailblazer herself, Rand trained at the Art Students League in New York and then with American sculptor and painter Frederick MacMonnies in Paris in the 1890s. She supported her family with her art from her student years onward, receiving considerable acclaim in her day as a female professional.</p>\n",
