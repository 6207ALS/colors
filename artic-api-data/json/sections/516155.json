In the form of an honorific dedication, it says \u201c[To] the emperor, Caesar Nerva Trajan, the Best, Augustus, [the conqueror of] Germany and Dacia.\u201d The phrase optimus princeps, the Best Prince, had already appeared on coins as early as A.D. 103: see cat. 47, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Emperor Trajan. Here, however, it appears in a formal position as part of the emperor\u2019s name (TRAIANO OPTIMO, in the dative case). This means that the coin must date from 114 at the earliest, when the Senate bestowed this distinctive honor on him.\n\nTrajan left an impressive legacy of social welfare programs and building campaigns in Rome, but his coinage focused on his expansion of the Roman Empire. The majority of the coin types reflect the Dacian campaigns, but this coin reflects Rome\u2019s eager anticipation of yet another addition to Rome\u2019s provincial satellites. Minted in Rome, it imagines the scene as Trajan confirms three unidentified client kings (\u201ckingdoms assigned,\u201d as the reverse inscription declares) in the area of Mesopotamia, as part of his preparations for the great campaign against Parthia. Trajan later received the title Parthicus by decree of the Senate while he was still campaigning in the East, dealing with the backlash of revolts by some of those client kings (Seleucia and Judea). He died in 117 in Selinus in Cilicia, only sixty-four years old but worn out and ill, leaving the volatile situation in Parthia to be dealt with by his successor, Hadrian.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Bennett, Trajan, p. 212.\n\nThis was in early summer 116; this coin predates that, since that title does not appear.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 48 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Trajan, A.D. 114/15\n\n</section>",
