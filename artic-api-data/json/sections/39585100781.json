While five sketchbooks remain bound, others were taken apart, their sheets removed from their bindings and often cut down into smaller sheets. Sketch of Maori Woman and Child is certainly one of these many sheets. In this case, it is likely that Gauguin removed the sheet from a sketchbook and cut it down to follow the contours of the figures. Two additional sheets in the Art Institute\u2019s collection have been similarly cut down into smaller sheets (cats. 36 and 38). On the verso of this sketch there are two small partial figural sketches.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 37.2).\n\nThree drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, Head of a Tahitian Woman (cat. 36), Tahitian Eve (cat. 38), and this sheet, bear a striking similarity to each other. All are drawn on the same type of paper, all have been trimmed to some degree, and all are drawn in ink that was originally purple. This sheet, however, is irregularly cut to conform to the shape of the sketch. Another sketch, Hina (Maori Woman Stylized as an Idol) (fig. 37.3), appears to derive from the same moment; it is cut in a similar manner and was documented early in the twentieth century as being drawn with pen and purple ink. The ink used for the three Chicago sketches is identical, the pigment particles disperse in the same way, and the ink has faded in like manner. In this drawing, lighter passages of ink appear pale yellow under magnification, with flecks of black-pigment particles sparsely dispersed in the drawn lines, while in darker areas, the flecks of black pigment are more prominent and gather together (fig. 37.4).\n\nXRF analysis of the ink has confirmed the presence of chromium, a major component in the manufacture of chrome logwood ink. Bottled chrome logwood inks could be purchased in a variety of tones that ranged from bright purple to reddish mauve, and brownish purple to brownish black, depending upon the amount of metal salts, such as iron, added. Higher metal-salt content would produce darker and blacker inks. The nature of the logwood dye used in the manufacture of the inks would determine the purple hue that could be obtained. However, the inherent instability of chrome logwood inks often results in the complete loss of their purple hues, as has happened in this drawing.\n\nOnly minimal amounts of iron are present here, indicative of an ink formulation that was likely quite purple in tone. Despite the low levels of iron detected, the chromium to iron ratio does vary depending on the intensity of the ink in the analyzed areas. This helps to confirm the presence of two different inks: a pale ink with low levels of chromium and a dark one with higher chromium levels. Early chroniclers of Gauguin\u2019s drawings often referenced a range of colored inks from violette (purple) to bleue (blue) to black. Present-day viewers may find it difficult to imagine what Gauguin\u2019s ink sketches would have looked like as they first emerged from a pen loaded with purple ink. A digital recolorization based on the study of unfaded ink samples provides a hypothetical rendering (fig. 37.5).\n\nTouches of graphite were used to reinforce the Maori woman\u2019s breasts, her proper left shoulder, arm and cupped hand, and proper right forearm. These lines would have been much less prominent when drawn over unfaded purple ink. Today, the graphite lines add a silvery gray tone to the composition that does not harmonize with the warm tones that surround them and detracts from the legibility of the drawing.\n\nOn the verso there is a sketch of a standing male figure in the upper left and a kneeling figure along the bottom. These forms were cropped when the sheet was cut into its present shape.\n\nThe paper is typical of a type that was often bound into Gauguin\u2019s sketchbooks\u2014poor-quality, thin, moderately sized, machine-made stock conducive to working in inks and watercolors, or with charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. This sheet was cut down along all of its edges, yet its physical characteristics, combined with its unusual size, reveal that it too is a page removed from a sketchbook.\n\nThe sheet is identical in type to that used for Head of a Tahitian Woman (cat. 36) and Tahitian Eve (cat. 38), pages that were also likely removed from a disassembled sketchbook dating from Gauguin\u2019s first Tahitian voyage in 1891\u201393. Although the sheets upon which all of the sketches were drawn suffered significant discoloration due to overexposure to light, the sheets of paper are of a similar tone in areas that were protected from light; they have the same surface texture, weight, and wove paper mold characteristics. In them, the paper fibers display the same mesh pattern from the mold and appear evenly dispersed throughout when viewed in transmitted light. Also, under ultraviolet light the sheets fluoresce dull yellow, a characteristic that is common to a number of disbound sketchbook sheets and indicative of the aged gelatin sizing in the paper.\n\n163 \u00d7 43 mm (max.)\n\nExtensive examination and treatment was carried out in 2002. As part of this campaign, a secondary support was removed, which revealed the verso of this fragmentary sketchbook sheet. Even through the secondary support, numerous abrasions were observed and were likely the reason the small, vulnerable sheet was initially mounted to a backing. After the backing was removed, the abraded areas were reinforced with Japanese paper fibers, and small edge tears were mended.\n\nThe drawing is in sound, stable condition. The inks remain much faded and embrittled. Conservation treatment rendered the sheet brighter and increased overall contrast in the composition, making it more legible. In raking light, abraded areas appear more dimensional on the verso and paper deformations more pronounced on the recto. In transmitted light, the uneven paper thickness is visible. Although the presence of these abrasions make it likely that the small sheet was initially mounted to provide structural support, it was decided that a new backing that would obscure the fragmentary sketches on the verso was not necessary.  \nHarriet K.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available the jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nIn the list of illustrations the work is described as \u201cDessin a la plume, a l\u2019encre violette\u201d (\u201cDrawing in pen, in purple ink\u201d). Reproduced in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 sa femme et \u00e0 ses amis, ed. Maurice Malingue (B. Grasset, 1946), opposite p. 176, pl. 22.\n\nThe Chicago drawing, plate 23, opposite page 177, is also listed as \u201cDrawing in pen, in purple ink.\u201d Hina (Woman Stylized as a Maori Idol) also appears in Exposition Gauguin: Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, preface by Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, exh. cat.(Galerie Marcel Guiot, 1942), as no. 56, in which it is also described as drawn in pen and purple ink (\u201cdessin a la plume, a l\u2019encre violette\u201d).\n\nI am grateful to C\u00e9line Daher for her XRF analysis and identification of chrome logwood ink.

To clarify his working practice, the brown and purple inks on forty-two drawings executed by Van Gogh during the period 1878\u201390 were identified using fiber-optic reflectance spectroscopy (FORS). Chrome logwood ink was identified.\n\nA number of works drawn in pen and purple ink are listed in the exhibition catalogue Exposition Gauguin: Aquarelles, monotypes, dessins, preface by Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, exh. cat. (Galerie Marcel Guiot, 1942). Chicago\u2019s Maori Woman and Her Child (cat. 37) is number 55 in the checklist; a second drawing, entitled Hina (Maori Woman Stylized as an Idol), is number 56. The latter is reproduced in Letttres de Gauguin \u00e0 sa femme et \u00e0 ses amis, ed. Maurice Malingue (B.

Field, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, exh. cat. (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), p. 25. This drawing was part of Gauguin\u2019s portfolio, Documents Tahiti: 1891, 1892, 1893, which remained together until it was dispersed at the 1942 Galerie Marcel Guiot sale. Due to the contents of the portfolio, which contained many of Gauguin\u2019s later monotypes from 1899 or 1900, Field assumes this was part of the artist\u2019s estate at the time of his death.
