    "description": "<p>John Singer Sargent (1856-1925), was one of the most sought-after portraitists of his generation on both sides of the Atlantic, creating powerful vibrant likenesses of his sitters. Best known for his portraits,<br>Sargent nevertheless excelled in a variety of genres, including landscapes, watercolors, and murals. This talk explores the artist\u2019s controversial and international career focusing on his relationship with Chicago and his undisputed influence in art history. </p><p>After lunch in the Chicago Stock Exchange Trading Room, you have several options to fill out your day. You may choose to hear Kathy Cummings discuss <a href=\"/exhibition/georg-jensen-scandinavian-design-living\"><em >Georg Jensen: Scandinavian Design for Living</em></a>. This exhibit is the first major American presentation of Jensen\u2019s silver tableware and products for the home as it traces the changing ideals for modern living in the 20th century.
