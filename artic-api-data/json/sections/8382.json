This occurred after Commodore Matthew Perry opened up trade routes between Japan and the West in 1853, resulting in an influx of Japanese objects into Western markets. While Japanese-inspired American production began slowly, it exploded after the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial International Exhibition, where many witnessed the breadth of Japanese art and designs at that nation\u2019s pavilion and dwelling.\n\nTiffany &amp; Co. was at the forefront of this craze, producing Japanesque silver as early as 1870. In 1876 the firm sent English craftsman Christopher Dresser to Japan to collect examples of metalware that could provide more direct technological and aesthetic inspiration to its designers. A newspaper account of Dresser\u2019s voyage states, \u201cMessrs. Tiffany &amp; Co. gave Dr. Dresser carte blanche to select the vast quantity of goods they now offer for sale and he has brought to them every variety of Japanese works, from the most splendid and costly to the simplest and cheapest.\u201d Edward C. Moore, Tiffany\u2019s chief designer from 1868 to 1891, amassed a personal collection of non-Western objects, including Japanese wares; he led the firm\u2019s production of Japanesque silver using foreign examples as points of departure for unique designs. This shift in the company\u2019s aesthetic received international acclaim at the 1878 Paris Exposition Universelle, where Tiffany took home the grand prize for silver ware and Charles L. Tiffany was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s teakettle and pitcher were two of the contributions that garnered high praise at the exhibition. A French account of Tiffany\u2019s presence illustrates the same pitcher design and a similarly shaped kettle as emblematic of the firm\u2019s new aesthetic (although whether the article is featuring the present objects or similar models on display is unknown). The kettle, which was designed and executed in 1877 (the stand was a later, custom addition from 1889), is listed in the Tiffany archives as a \u201cTete a Tete Sake form Enamel,\u201d indicating that the source was a Japanese vessel used to serve rice wine. Kettles of this type, known as choshi, share the squat design and flattened spout seen on the Tiffany example, and often employ the same distinct handle form. The applied copper clouds are an amalgam of conventionalized motifs found in Japanese decorative arts, paintings, and woodblock prints, reflecting Tiffany\u2019s early foray into the adoption of Japanese aesthetics. By the following year, when the pitcher was executed, the firm\u2019s Japanesque wares had shifted toward more organic, naturalistic designs that unified form and decoration.\n\nWrapping around the body of the pitcher is an asymmetrical water scene with carp, dragonflies, and irises, realized through a combination of hammering, engraving, and applied elements. The vignette was almost certainly inspired by the work of Katsushika Hokusai, the Japanese artist best known for his dynamic woodblock prints of the natural world (see fig. 1). The Tiffany design library included three volumes of Hokusai\u2019s widely published works, many featuring the same graceful irises, enlivened dragonflies, and splashing carp. One of the pitcher\u2019s distinct features, exemplifying the company\u2019s evolving aesthetic, is the way the decorative scheme carries through the form and ornament. The base of the pitcher flares slightly at the water level, allowing the elegantly engraved ripples of the sea to flow outward, enveloping the plant and animal life rather than simply serving as a backdrop to the scene. The irises also shape the design, curving delicately off the body and up the handle.\n\nTiffany\u2019s mastery of mixed-metal techniques, here expressed by the scrolling copper clouds on the kettle and the flora and fauna appliqu\u00e9s on the pitcher, charted new terrain in the American silver industry. One reviewer went so far as to characterize it as \u201cthe most important step in artistic metal work which our country has taken.\u201d The coloristic effects that could be achieved by introducing different alloys gave silversmiths a painterly palette previously absent from their vocabulary, aside from the addition of enamels and gemstones. Such works typify Tiffany\u2019s remarkable advancements in domestic silver production, rightly forecasted by one account as markers of an American Renaissance likely to \u201cstand out boldly in the history of industrial art in this century.\u201d  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See C.
