The work was unveiled on Thanksgiving Day 1887, underlining the importance of visualizing settler origin stories for some members of the local community. Striding purposefully forward with a knotty walking stick and a hefty Bible, the figure embodies perseverance, resilience, and stern morality\u2014qualities expressed with both admiration and a degree of humor. Saint-Gaudens created this smaller, generalized version and sold it in multiples entitled <em>The Puritan</em> after the statue proved immensely popular amid the growing interest in a Colonial Revival at the turn of the 20th century.</p>\n",
