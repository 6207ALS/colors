    "description": "<p>Henri Matisse\u2019s Jazz is often considered the pinnacle of livres d\u2019artiste. Livres d\u2019artiste, or artist\u2019s books, are typically collaborations between artists and authors resulting in limited edition, fine-crafted, beautifully printed books with original graphic work. The tradition was particularly strong in France in the beginning-to-mid 20th century.Like many of his contemporaries, Matisse was part of this movement; Jazz was by far his most ambitious and beautiful book. He composed the copy and then hand-wrote the curvy, playful calligraphic text in addition to creating all of the images. The images are the primary focus, and as Matisse himself explains at the beginning of the book, the role of the text \u201cis purely visual.\u201dThe publisher T\u00e9riade produced only 270 complete copies of this book of loose folio sheets, which include 20 color pochoirs\u2014prints hand-colored using a stenciling technique. A variety of motifs\u2014the circus, the sea, algae, leaves\u2014runs throughout the book, displaying Matisse\u2019s famous technique of brightly colored cut-outs. The end result is a lush, lively creation that feels as fresh today as at its conception.</p>\n",
