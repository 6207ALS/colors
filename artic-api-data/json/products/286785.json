    "description": "<p>Acanthus leaves are a popular motif in William Morris' work. His associate, John Henry Dearle, took them and added a vertical element in the fruit tree trunks to create the pattern Orchard. It is reminiscent of wall hangings designed by Dearle and Morris' younger daughter, May, in the late 1890's. Ships nicely boxed and ready for gifting.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 2 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> solid brass, electro-plated with non-tarnishing silver finish, giclee print, domed, ear wires are hypo-allergenic<strong><br></strong></li></ul>",
