    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Here\u2019s curator Mary Greuel recorded in the gallery.</p>\n<p>MARY GREUGEL:  This figure is a Roman copy of the second century A.D. The original was created in the fifth century B.C. by one of the great Greek sculptures Phidias. This figure is taken from the shield of Athena Parthenos. There was the great cult statute that Phidias created in the fifth century to honor the goddess Athena. And the shield was carved with a battle scene of the Amazons, a fight between the Amazons and the Greeks. This piece does show the capturing of the classical feeling and the elegance of the figure in the calmness of this warrior who has been wounded. His arm is behind him. And yet, he has this very graceful elegance to his face and to his figure.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR::  In this Roman copy, the figure of the fallen Greek warrior was taken out of its original context and used alone as a decorative architectural element. To the left of the figure, you\u2019ll see a straight border carved into the stone a remnant of the architecture to which it once belonged.</p>\n<p>MARY GREUGEL:  This figure was found in the port outside of Athens. So we know that it was a shipment of several of these which were found and they were meant for clients in Rome who had ordered them from Greek sculptors. And the shipment never made it to Rome, sunk. So this particular slab shows the evidence of its long, long time that it spent in the sea with all of the pitting areas worn into the surface of the marble.</p>\n",
