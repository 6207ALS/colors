The rim, rounded by reheating, has faint spiral ribbing from tooling below the rim on the body. A bell-shaped beaker form with the long, flared upper body tapering inward to a short, squat globular bottom. Below, the wall tapers, bending down and in sharply, then is tooled to form a short solid stem. The base was applied to the stem with a kicked underside and an edge rounded by reheating. There is a pontil mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 122.1.\n\nThe beaker is intact, the surface is extensively pitted with some patches of creamy weathering product on the base with overall brilliant and silvery iridescence.\n\nThe fabrication of this vessel is quite unusual and appears to have no close parallel. It does relate to a metal lamp form with a very similar profile found in a first- or second-century-A.D. settlement at Naaldwijk in the Netherlands.\n\nThe curvilinear profile of this beaker is a variation on a Roman chalice. There are several later footed beakers in the Corning Museum of Glass that relate to the form but have a less sharply attenuated profile. Related to the Corning examples is a footed beaker in the Toledo Museum of Art with spiral ribbing.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Boeselager, \u201cZur Datierung der Gl\u00e4ser,\u201d p. 33, fig. 19.\n\nIsings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, pp. 50\u201352, form 36c.\n\nWhitehouse, Roman Glass 2, p. 156, no. 674, an amethyst goblet; p. 215, no. 782, a goblet on a short stem with tooled and marvered trail decoration on the body.\n\nToledo Museum of Art, acc. no. 1923.560.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 122 Beaker or Goblet, 2nd/3rd century A.D.\n\nfig. 122.1 Beaker or Goblet (2nd/3rd century A.D.).
