    "description": "<p>Since the late 1960s, William Leavitt has produced sculptural tableaux, works on paper, and performances that draw upon and embrace the blurred lines between real and fake that characterizes much of Southern California culture. The artist\u2019s installations evoke a \u201ctheater of the ordinary,\u201d quoting strangely familiar locations such as soap-opera sets, furniture showrooms, and suburban interiors. These constructions\u2014always empty and pur- posefully incomplete\u2014summon recognizable spaces but are also evidently artificial. The objects in <em>Manta Ray</em> are like characters in a play, ripe with potential. Leavitt has explained that in these works he is \u201ctrying to frame some story through an object or a painting or a situation that would lend itself to further narrative.</p>\n",
