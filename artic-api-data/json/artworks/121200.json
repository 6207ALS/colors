    "description": "<p>An interest in the social habits that shape our perceptions of one another and our built environment marks Dan Graham's interdisciplinary practice, which encompasses photography, film and video, performance, and site-specific installations. <em>New Row Houses</em> was taken as part of his pivotal Conceptual work Homes for America. First presented in 1966 as a slideshow, the project comprised photographs of housing developments that Graham captured during his frequent commute between New York City and his parents' home in Westfield, New Jersey. Graham emphasized the repetitive, reductive nature of a mass-produced suburban landscape in a way that suggested that Minimal Art might be found and interpreted to greater effect in the real world. The project appeared in multiple forms, including an illustrated article in <em>Arts Magazine</em>. Graham continued to take photographs of these structures well into the 1970s, even as he developed his own architectural forms.</p>\n",
