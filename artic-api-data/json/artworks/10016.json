    "description": "<p>The purpose of the first portrait coins was to identify the ruler. The front side became a mirror of the sovereign\u2019s self-image. The back was often used to communicate the ruler\u2019s accomplishments or intentions. The profile portrait was used because it suited the very shallow depth and limited surface of the coin. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how modern coins are created today.</p>\n<p><em>Portraits Celebrate</em><br>Coins were an excellent way for leaders to advertise their victories whether in battle or at the Olympic Games.  Emperor Trajan\u2019s (r. A.D. 98\u2013117) conquest of the kingdom of Dacia is symbolized by the defeated figure crouching before Trajan\u2019s victory trophy.</p>\n",
