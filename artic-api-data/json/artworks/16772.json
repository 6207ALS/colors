    "description": "<p><em>Adirondacks Guide</em> is a sensitive portrait of the guide Rufus Wallace, shown returning from duck hunting in his canoe.  Although the background of lake and sky are only loosely suggested, the details of the old man\u2019s face, beard, and still-strong body are carefully rendered with brushstrokes of diluted color.  His gaze, forward and slightly elevated, is evocative; one senses that the old man is at once alert to nature and lost in his own contemplations.</p>\n",
