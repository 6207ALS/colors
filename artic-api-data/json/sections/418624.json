Caillebotte (lower right, in light blue ink)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, restricted gift of Janet and William Jentes, 1995.189\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">The age at which Caillebotte made this intense self-portrait is unclear. Art historian Kirk Varnedoe published it in relation to two late self-portraits by the artist made in 1888/89 and 1892 but did not determine the exact moment of its production. Its resemblance to a self-portrait dated circa 1892 in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay\u2014which, like the Art Institute\u2019s drawing, has a plain background\u2014counts among the most compelling comparisons (fig. 5.1 [Berhaut 1978, no. 411; Berhaut 1994, no. 436]). In that image, the artist seems solemn, perhaps an indication of the painful life events he had suffered in recent years. By the time he made the Orsay picture, Caillebotte had experienced loss and illness; if the expression he wears is in marked contrast to a jovial self-portrait of 1873/74 (fig. 5.2 [Berhaut 1994, no. 509]), it is perhaps unsurprising. More prosaically, the artist\u2019s appearance in certain photographs supports a later date for the Art Institute\u2019s drawing (for example, fig. 5.3 and fig. 5.4). These suggest that his face was fuller in youth than it was in middle age.\n\nExpanding the argument further, more recently, art historian Michael Marrinan has suggested that the work could date to around 1879. The artist had received harsh criticism that year and made his Self- Portrait at an Easel of circa 1879 (fig. 5.5 [Berhaut 1978, no. 118; Berhaut 1994, no. 132]) as an apparent act of reassertion. The air of defiance with which Caillebotte meets the viewer in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing might connect it with the same moment. Both images exude self-confidence. In the drawing, the artist peers out from beneath the brim of a hat, his features largely in shadow. As in the painting, his mouth is closed firmly, and his jawline tapers to a similarly light beard.\n\nThe drawing and Self-Portrait at an Easel may also share a working method that could support a late 1870s date for Self-Portrait with a Hat. Art historian Michael Fried has argued convincingly that Caillebotte made the painting with the help of a mirror, since a reversed version of a work in the artist\u2019s collection\u2014Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2019s famous Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (fig. 5.6)\u2014features in its background. It is possible that, if Caillebotte used a mirror to draw the Art Institute\u2019s work, the downward tilt of his head resulted from looking to his reflected image and the paper in turn. This angled glance at the viewer became a leitmotif of his self-portraiture. Sometimes the artist positioned his body to the left (fig. 5.7 [Berhaut 1994, no. 26]), sometimes to the right (fig. 5.8 [Berhaut 1978, no. 366; Berhaut 1994, no. 404]), but the sideways presentation appeared repeatedly.\n\nCaillebotte\u2019s costume in the work\u2014a brimmed hat with jacket and perhaps a tie or cravat\u2014suggests that the work was made during the summer. Marrinan has noted its similarity to the outfits worn by participants in, and spectators of, the regattas along the Seine that were sponsored by the Paris Yacht Club. Since Caillebotte\u2019s involvement with sailing became more intense in the late 1870s, in some small way this too might support a revised date for the image.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This self-portrait is executed in a medium-to-hard graphite pencil that imparted fine, thin, and rather faint lines onto the paper. The graphite is concentrated in the face and used sparingly elsewhere. As a carbon-based material, graphite absorbs strongly in the infrared region. The infrared image makes it possible to see the changes the artist made to the top of the hat (fig. 5.9) and to distinguish the line of Caillebotte\u2019s chin, which is covered by what appears to be a youthful, scruffy goatee. Notably, the non-carbon-based stamp disappears in the infrared image.\n\nThe support is a handmade sheet of laid paper. The top, bottom, and right side of the sheet have deckle edges; the left edge appears cut, which suggests that the artist used a half sheet. Transmitted-light imaging (fig. 5.10) reveals the laid and chain pattern of the paper. There are nine laid lines per 10 mm, and the chain lines are spaced 28\u201329 mm apart. The fiber distribution is uneven along the horizontal laid lines, causing many areas to appear darker in transmitted light. There are numerous tiny shives and undigested fibers in the paper that create scattered dark specks within the formed sheet.\n\n490 \u00d7 315 mm\n\nA light blue ink stamp, G. Caillebotte, appears in the lower right. Under high magnification it seems that tiny portions of the letters in the stamp may have been intensified with a darker color (fig. 5.11). In a 1987 illustration of the drawing, the stamp does not appear (fig. 5.12). In a 1988 illustration, it clearly has been stamped (fig. 5.13). In the opinion of Kirk Varnedoe, the blue ink stamp appears only on works given by the artist to his brother Martial and by Martial to his descendants. According to Sylvie Brame of Galerie Brame et Lorenceau, which exhibited the drawing in 1989 and sold it to the Art Institute in 1995, the stamp was applied in 1988 in preparation for the gallery\u2019s 1989 Gustave Caillebotte exhibition.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition. There is a small tear, now repaired, in the right edge, 26 mm from the bottom edge. There are a few tiny splatters of oil paint, unrelated to this image and probably a result of the drawing\u2019s presence in the artist\u2019s studio. There are two tiny losses in the paper, one located 17 mm from the bottom edge and 115 mm from the right edge, and the other located 350 mm from the bottom edge and 185 mm from the right edge.\n\nTransmitted light was used to detect and document the laid and chain pattern of the sheet formation. A Leica 6E microscope with 6.3\u201340\u00d7 magnification was employed to examine graphite lines and the ink stamp. Infrared reflectography (Fuji, 1.0\u20131.1 \u00b5m) was employed to enhance fainter graphite lines.  \nAntoinette Owen\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Estate of the artist to a private collector, France, c. 1985.\n\nBy descent from the artist (died 1894) to his brother Martial Caillebotte (1853\u20131910) and Marie Minoret (Martial\u2019s wife), Paris, 1894.\n\nAquired by a private collector, France, c. 1985\n\nPrivate collector, France, to Galerie Brame et Lorenceau, Paris, by 1995.\n\nSold by Galerie Brame et Lorenceau, Paris, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1995.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Brame et Lorenceau, Gustave Caillebotte, 1848\u20131894: Dessins, \u00e9tudes, peintures, Feb. 28\u2013Mar, 24, 1989, cat.
