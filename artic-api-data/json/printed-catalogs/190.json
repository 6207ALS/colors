    "copy": " This stunning book unites the pioneering work of six artists and designers: Clara Porset, Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo, Anni Albers, Ruth Asawa, Cynthia Sargent, and Sheila Hicks. Inspired by both local traditions and modern methods, these women made art that reflected and contributed to Mexico\u2019s rich artistic landscape at the height of the modern period. Their work\u2014which includes furniture design, jewelry, photography, photomurals, prints, sculpture, and textiles\u2014was rooted in modernism and grounded in abstraction. This constellation of like-minded practitioners shared an affinity for Mexico, a country all lived in or visited between the 1940s and the 1970s. In bringing their works together for the first time, this book offers an entirely new lens on modernism in Mexico. Exploring the artistic culture of the country\u2019s postrevolutionary period, In a Cloud, in a Wall, in a Chair contains reproductions from the exhibition catalogue\u2014no longer in print\u2014that accompanied Clara Porset\u2019s groundbreaking 1952 Mexico City exhibition Art in Daily Life as well as vivid reproductions of each artist\u2019s work. Essays written by an international team of esteemed scholars tell a more complete and nuanced story of Mexico\u2019s role as a center of modern art and design.
