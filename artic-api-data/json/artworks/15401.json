    "description": "<p>In this vivid painting, William Glackens portrayed the members of his circle at their favorite meeting place, the New York restaurant Mouquin\u2019s. Jeanne Mouquin, the proprietor\u2019s wife, shares a drink with James B. Moore, a wealthy playboy and restaurateur, while the artist\u2019s wife, Edith, and art critic Charles Fitzgerald are reflected in the mirror behind them. Glackens used vivid brushwork to describe Jeanne Mouquin\u2019s dress, while depicting her with an intent gaze that imbues the scene with tension and mystery. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.</p>\n",
