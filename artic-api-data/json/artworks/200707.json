    "description": "<p>This hen was modeled somewhat simply, but very effectively. Comb marks along her body suggest feathers, and the features of her face and comb were made with simple tools or by hand. The hen\u2019s body is actually one slab of clay that was folded to form the tail section. Many other haniwa in the shape of birds\u2014such as waterfowl, swans, and hens\u2014with similar simple execution but great sensitivity and expressiveness have been excavated, largely in the Kant\u00f4 region. This piece was unearthed in Tochigi prefecture and was once in the well-known private collection of Okura Hisashi (1892\u20131960).</p>\n",
