Disappointed with the extent of Westernization, he sought out rural areas that satisfied his fantasy of Tahiti as a \u201cpre-modern\u201d or \u201cprimitive\u201d society. The indigenous figures depicted on this sheet relate to his idealistic painted scenes of \u201cunspoiled\u201d Tahiti, though\u2014as the apparent spontaneity of the sketches suggests\u2014firsthand observation played a key part in their genesis.\n\nThis sheet consists primarily of images of people and profiles. These include three individual portraits that the artist worked over in watercolor. The heads of two of the portraits, one of a girl and one of a boy, are surrounded by washes of vibrant blue. It appears that Gauguin aimed to distinguish their forms from the background, since the blue washes isolate the heads and lend a sense of flatness to the drawing. This sheet was once joined with another from the same sketchbook. The two were likely adhered together after the volume was disbound in order to make a more impressive, and therefore more salable, presentation. They have since been separated to reflect their original format.\n\nIn sketchbooks and sketches, such as this one, Gauguin would often use a watercolor wash around his figures, possibly to distinguish their situation on the page, as in an alternative example from his Tahitian sketchbook (see fig. 33.2). In Sketches of Children, a Woman, and Profiles and Sketches of Horses and Child, in particular, it seems as if Gauguin worked quickly. Often he drew only the outline of forms but, occasionally, he used hatching to indicate shadow, as in the ear of the female portrait on the right. In addition, the crouching woman in the lower half of the sheet became a recurring motif in many later paintings and drawings, such as Crouching Tahitian Woman (related to the painting Nafea faa ipoipo [When Will You Marry?]) (fig. 33.3 [cat. 46]) and the painting (fig. 33.4 [W 454]).  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This sheet was removed from a rather large ledger book, the size of which was more conducive to record keeping than to extemporaneous plein air sketching. The sheet was likely still bound in the sketchbook when Gauguin left it with Francesco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio before returning to Tahiti in 1895. By the time the sheet was sold to Walther Geiser in 1931, it had been removed from its binding and paired with and adhered to a companion sheet of studies from the same volume (cat. 34), then framed (see Provenance). Two distinctive hands have inscribed their numbers to this sheet and its companion as well as to twelve additional works in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. These numbers correspond to the list presented in the Salon d\u2019Automne\u2019s 1906 4me exposition: Catalogue d\u2019ouvrages, in which \u201ctrois albums avec croquis\u201d (\u201cthree albums with sketches\u201d) from the Durrio collection are prominently listed.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the sheets may have been consecutive pages when bound, and, once disbound, were stacked on top of the other. There is a large area of accumulated surface dirt on the verso along the left edge of this sheet (fig. 33.5). When a loss in the companion sheet is placed on top of this area of accumulated surface dirt, the soiling pattern corresponds in size, shape, and orientation to the area of loss in the companion sheet (fig. 33.6). The diagonal creases in both sheets match exactly when this sheet is skewed diagonally 4 mm counterclockwise and placed beneath the companion sheet to align the creases (fig. 33.7). It appears that as the pages were removed from the sketchbook, their order was retained in a stack, one in which one sheet was placed atop and askew of the other for a significant period of time during which surface dirt settled on the exposed area of the underlying sheet.\n\nOn the recto of this sketchbook page, Gauguin drew five distinct portraits of four children and a crouching adolescent. It appears that he did so in two stages, beginning with light touches of graphite and pen and ink, over which he applied watercolors. He further reinforced ink lines with graphite and added a bright ultramarine blue behind two of the children. He used a pen with a metal nib, and as he drew, the nib incised parallel lines into the paper at the edges of each drawn line (fig. 33.8).\n\nGauguin loosely divided the composition on the recto into quadrants and, using graphite and pen and ink, populated each quadrant with a figure. On the verso a single child is depicted in the top half of the sheet while two horses drawn only in graphite appear in the bottom half. Watercolors were applied over the graphite and ink. At some point the artist then reinforced the ink lines with additional graphite (fig. 33.9), at first using a soft touch and then with enough pressure to incise the paper.\n\nA limited range of pigments was identified using XRF and Raman microspectroscopy. Ultramarine blue predominates on the recto. The red present throughout is vermilion. Pale shades of lilac are a mixture of vermilion and blue pigments, likely a combination of ultramarine with some Prussian blue. The different shades of brown, from a yellowish brown to a cooler brown, are a mixture of an iron oxide\u2013based pigment such as ocher, combined with strontium yellow and vermilion. Lesser amounts of lead white are also present.\n\nThe paper is typical of a type that was often bound into Gauguin\u2019s sketchbooks\u2014poor-quality, thin, smooth, moderately sized, machine-made wove stock conducive to working in inks and watercolors or with charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. Under ultraviolet light, the sheet fluoresces a dull yellow. This fluorescence is common among the various sketchbook sheets examined and is likely attributable to the aged gelatin sizing used in the manufacture of the papers. The paper fibers appear evenly distributed when the sheet is viewed in transmitted light. As a result of overexposure to light, the once-cream paper has now discolored to tan.\n\n320 \u00d7 217 mm\n\nWhen this sheet was joined to another sheet from the same sketchbook (see cat. 34), it was mounted along the left edge, framed\u2014perhaps in anticipation of the 1928 Basel exhibition (see Exhibition History)\u2014and exposed to light on the recto. This exposure contributed to the significant darkening of the sheet tone on one side and likely contributed to ink fading as well, although the ink is equally degraded on the verso where light exposure was negligible. Today, several passages on the recto are barely discernible to the unaided eye.\n\nWhile significant fading and color change of inks and watercolors are primarily the result of overexposure to light, it is also possible for materials to alter with changes in the pH of their environment. Gauguin\u2019s ink, one that was possibly aniline purple when he picked up his pen to draw with it, has changed considerably. As the poor-quality paper became more and more acidic with age, the acidic environment that developed caused the ink to alter to the pale-yellow tone seen today. Before 1916, when Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Vizzavona photographed the sheet, the inked lines were still robust and maintained a significant compositional presence in the drawing (fig. 33.10).\n\nAs noted above, at some time after 1906 this and another sheet from the same sketchbook were adhered together along a vertical edge to form a single sheet that measured 320 \u00d7 437 mm. Reports written in 1995 and 2002 address this large, paired sheet. In 2015, the sheets were separated. This was done by brush applying a minimal amount of water to the one-eighth-inch area of overlapping paper to soften the adhesive and release the sheets. Further treatment followed to stabilize the sheet and its companion.\n\nIt was not until in-depth examination and extensive research were undertaken for this study that it was determined that the two sheets that originally formed one larger paired support were not intended to be joined together. Each is a sheet in its own right removed from the same sketchbook, although their exact placement within the bound volume cannot be definitively determined. It appears that the sheets were adhered together some time after Durrio acquired them. He had at least this one photographed individually by Vizzavona (fig. 33.10). Archival records provided by the Geiser family indicate the sheets were joined by the time they were listed in his inventory in 1931.\n\nThis sheet was once folded in half through the center on the short side, and an old crease remains. It is in fact this crease that first led to a reexamination of the larger combined sheet. When compared with its companion, the crease in that sheet should have appeared as a mirror image of the crease in this sheet if indeed they had once been folded in four as previously assumed. Instead the creasing was identical, indicating that one sheet had been placed atop the other and the pair folded together along the short side.  \nHarriet K.

Hatje, 1988).\n\nSee Technical Study.\n\nSome time before Eugene Druet\u2019s death in 1916, Galerie Druet commissioned the photographer Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Vizzavona of the firm of the same name to photograph works from the Druet collection as well as those in the collections of others in his circle. This circle included Francisco Durrio, and the group of images Vizzavona photographed from Durrio\u2019s collection has aided recent provenance, authentication, and technical studies. Among Durrio\u2019s group of works by Gauguin, Vizzavona photographed this drawing documenting the single sheet without its companion.\n\nFor a reproduction and the entry that cites Vizzavona, see John Rewald, Gauguin Drawings, Bittner Art Book (T. Yoseloff, 1958), p. 27 and fig. 35. It should be noted that scholars, among them Richard S. Field (\u201cGauguin Monotypes,\u201d Print Collector\u2019s Newsletter 3, no. 5 [Nov.\u2013Dec. 1972], p. 97), believe the works were photographed by Vizzavona in 1910.\n\nIn Walther Geiser\u2019s unpublished inventory no. 300 is a double-sided drawing that measured 315 \u00d7 426 mm. He refers to the sheet variously as studies of children and animals (Tahiti . . .) and Kinder, T, and cross-references his entries to the Kunsthalle Basel exhibition catalogue, in which it is no. 143 and entitled Tahiti-Kinder. He likely measured the work in its frame given the difference in dimensions by 5 mm and 8 mm, respectively.\n\nSee also cats. 51.2, 51.3, 52.1, 53.4, 54.2, 54.3, 55.2, 56.1, 57.1, 58.1, 59.2, and 82.3.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Salon d\u2019Automne, 4me exposition: Catalogue des ouvrages, exh. cat.

I am grateful to Mel Becker Solomon for collaborating on these inscriptions and for deducing their connection to this 1906 exhibition. The significance of the second set of inscriptions has yet to be determined, but they undoubtedly have a relationship to the first.\n\nOrder of application is ascertained when the graphite is examined under magnification. Where watercolor was applied over graphite, the particulate medium loses its distinctive silvery appearance. In areas where graphite was applied over watercolor, it maintains its characteristic silvery appearance.\n\nXRF was complemented with Raman microspectroscopy to confirm the presence of ultramarine and Prussian blue. All other pigments could be confirmed with XRF alone. Additionally, the paper was found to contain calcium, potassium, and iron with other trace elements (titanium, copper, zinc, and lead). I am grateful to C\u00e9line Daher for her analysis of these pigments. Celine Daher, XRF analytical results summary, Oct. 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ink was analyzed in several areas and they did not show any particular elements using XRF, which suggests that an organic dye such as the popular aniline purple was used.\n\nFor a reproduction and the entry that cites Vizzavona, see John Rewald, Gauguin Drawings, Bittner Art Book (T.

This was done by brush applying a minimal amount of water to the one-eighth-inch area of overlapping paper to soften the adhesive and release the sheets. The work was conserved at that time.

I am grateful to Dr. Rudolf Reber for generously sharing his archival documentation with me and for providing photocopies to aid in our research for this publication.\n\nA number of early-state impressions on pink paper from Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite have soft, yet clearly visible, folds across the short sides of the sheets (for example, impressions of Noa Noa in a private collection [see cat. 51], and Nave nave fenua [Delightful Land] in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris [see cat. 56]).\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitions in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
