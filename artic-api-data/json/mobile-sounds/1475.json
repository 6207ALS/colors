    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This basalt sculpture of Vishnu made in central India in the tenth century illustrates the Hindu god\u2019s role as preserver and guardian. According to legend the earth, weighed down by evil, begins to sink into the cosmic oceans.<br>Madhuvanti Ghose:  What you\u2019re seeing is a scene where the earth goddess had been submerged under the cosmic oceans and the god Vishnu takes the form of the boar and jumps in through the cosmic oceans to rescue her. And when he is coming up she is clinging for dear life to his tusks. The earth goddess is regarded as the consort of Vishnu. Vishnu has two consorts. One is Bhu-Devi or the earth goddess and the other is Lakshmi, the goddess of fertility and wealth.<br>Narrator:  The serpent or naga you see beneath the boar\u2019s snout symbolizes the cosmic oceans as does the seated figure near the boar\u2019s belly. A carved lotus blossom decorates the boar\u2019s head and an umbrella probably once shaded the entire scene though only a stump on the boar\u2019s back remains. Sculptures like this boar incarnation of Vishnu being both in the round and fully theriomorphic or in animal form would usually have their own small side temple facing the Vishnu temple. The body of the boar is sculpted with rows of gods, demi-gods and animals symbolizing the entire cosmos. It is the only one of its kind in the United States and something well worth seeing.</p>\n",
