The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. The technical examination revealed that a different composition was started on the canvas. This was partially obliterated by a layer of white paint that was applied before the final composition was painted. It is difficult to tell precisely what the subject of the earlier composition was, but it seems to have included a prominent hill in the background on the left side. The stack does not appear to have been part of the earlier composition, based on the relatively dense buildup of the paint layers underneath the stack. Brushwork unrelated to the final composition is difficult to interpret due to interference from both the brushwork of the intermediate layer and the final painting. Breaks in the upper paint layers show that the earlier painting included bright green paint in areas underneath the field, the stack, and the hills, bright red paint in the foreground, and brighter shades of blue throughout the sky. This palette may indicate that the earlier composition was not a winter scene. The final painting consists largely of a wet-in-wet buildup of the brushwork. Final touches include the blue strokes dragged lightly over dry paint layers of the field and some finishing strokes applied at the lower corners. The stack appears to have been enlarged slightly on the left and right sides, with the brushstrokes at the edges extending over the field.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 31.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 91 (lower left, in brownish paint) (fig. 31.2). Some of the underlying paint was dry when the painting was signed, but other areas, specifically the thick pale-blue strokes along the bottom edge were still wet. This pale-blue paint appears to be related to some finishing touches added at the lower left and lower right corners (fig. 31.3).\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 92 cm. This corresponds to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 26.2V (0.8) \u00d7 20.5H (0.8) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave or thread count matches were detected with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is strong cusping along the left and top edges, moderate cusping along the right edge, and mild cusping on the bottom edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: The original canvas was mounted onto a one-sixteenth-inch solid metal support (the tacking margins were probably removed at this time); the metal support was then mounted onto a canvas and stretched onto the current stretcher before entering the Art Institute in 1983 (see Conservation History); tacks spaced 2\u20133 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Unknown; original tacking edges removed in previous treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-membered wood stretcher with vertical crossbar, and keyable, mitered mortise and tenon joints (six of ten keys inserted). Depth: 1.8 cm (outer edge).\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded, not documented. Depth: Unknown.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nBecause the original tacking margins have been removed (see Conservation History), it is not possible to know whether the ground extended to the edges of all of the tacking margins. The ground does, however, appear to continue onto the tacking edges, parts of which are visible around the edges of the painting (fig. 31.4, fig. 31.5), thus suggesting that this was a pre-primed canvas. The ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 10 to 80 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 31.6).\n\nThe ground is off-white, with dark particles visible under magnification (fig. 31.7).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following components: lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of iron oxide, alumina, various silicates, and silica. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting has a rich textural surface that incorporates both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint application, using a variety of brushwork. Technical imaging and close examination of the paint surface reveal the presence of brushwork and underlying layers of bright hues that are unrelated to the final composition. This is especially apparent at the edges of the painting where strokes of bright green and red paint are visible in the foreground area (fig. 31.8; fig. 31.9, fig. 31.10); in addition, shades of pale and bright blue can be seen in the sky (fig. 31.11; fig. 31.12). It appears that the artist used a broadly applied layer of white paint to cover the earlier, more colorful painting before beginning the final composition (fig. 31.13). This intermediate layer has a strong brushmarked surface that corresponds to the diagonal strokes (upper left to lower right) seen in the X-ray, especially in the sky and the stack areas (fig. 31.14). The white layer is visible at the edges of the painting (fig. 31.15) and at small areas of loss and breaks in the brushwork of the final composition (fig. 31.16, fig. 31.17, fig. 31.18). The white layer is not continuous but rather consists of open brushwork that often reveals glimpses of the underlying painting (fig. 31.19, fig. 31.20). Localized areas of interlayer cleavage between the earlier painting campaign and the intermediate white layer indicate that the earlier painting was already surface dry when it was painted over, resulting in poor adhesion between it and the layers applied on top (fig. 31.21). The relatively bright color scheme of the earlier painting may indicate that it was not a winter scene.\n\nIt is difficult to tell whether the earlier composition was also a wheat stack scene because the thick buildup of paint and the brushwork from the intermediate white layer make the X-ray difficult to read (fig. 31.22). However, there are brushstrokes unrelated to the final composition to the left of the stack, in the area of the trees. Toward the center of the painting, additional brushwork suggests a sloping landmass running through the upper center of the composition. The infrared reflectogram shows a form in the area above the trees on the left side (fig. 31.23). At breaks in the upper, pale pinkish-gray paint of the sky and the intermediate white layer in the area of this pentimento, dark and bright green paint is visible (fig. 31.24, fig. 31.25). Further areas of green paint were also observed at localized areas of abrasion along the horizon line (fig. 31.26), and down into the distant hills (fig. 31.27). The green paint of the earlier composition suggests that this was some kind of landform, which could relate to the sloping diagonal observed in the X-ray (i.e., a hill in the upper left third of the painting sloping down through the middle of the canvas to the midright edge).\n\nThe relative radio-opacity of the paint in the area of the stack suggests that the stack was not part of the original composition (fig. 31.28). The underlying paint layers were built up relatively densely underneath it; this includes bright green paint similar to that observed elsewhere in the foreground of the painting, which is visible microscopically through the open brushwork of the stack (fig. 31.29). The infrared reflectogram indicates that minor adjustments were made to the dimensions of the stack, particularly along the left and right edges where they were extended slightly over the field. Along the left edge of the stack, the intermediate white layer as well as some faint color strokes, is visible, suggesting that the snow-covered field was not worked up very far before the stack was expanded (fig. 31.30).\n\nIn the final composition, the paint application includes both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry buildup of the layers. Through gaps in the upper paint layers, it appears that the stack was laid in with thinly applied strokes of dull reddish-brown and green-brown paint (fig. 31.31), and then built up with thicker, more textural strokes of deeper reds, purples, and greens. Lead white\u2013rich strokes of pale blue and pale pink were used to indicate the snow-covered areas. The sky was built up wet-in-wet using undulating zigzag strokes in varying shades of gray with localized touches of pale blue, pink, and green added sporadically (fig. 31.32). The hills were reinforced along the upper edge, with long undulating strokes of blue paint, drawn along the horizon. These strokes pass over dry paint from the sky in some places, for example, near the center (fig. 31.33), with some final pinkish-gray strokes from the sky coming down over the hilltop, wet-in-wet. The dull purple trees were painted wet-in-wet over the sky and the hills in some places, and wet-over-dry in others. These observations indicate that the artist worked back and forth between the compositional elements to some extent. Some of the more fluid, thinly applied paint over the intermediate white layer (e.g., the dark blues and purples of the field and the hills and the dark browns, purples, and reds of the wheat stack) exhibits fine but extensive drying cracks, which appear to be caused by leaner, quicker-drying paint applied over slower-drying layers (fig. 31.34). Some of the final touches to the painting include the colorful strokes that were dragged across the peaks of the dried underlayers in the stack and the field, as well as finishing touches of pale-blue paint applied at the lower left and lower right corners, also over dry paint (fig. 31.35). The pale-blue paint was still wet when the painting was signed.\n\nThere are areas of disturbed paint in a narrow band approximately 1.5\u20132 cm from the top edge. It appears that something was pressed against the painting and then pulled away from the surface while the paint was still wet (fig. 31.36); this could relate to an easel cleat or transporting device. A few strokes of impasto, just above and to the right of the M in the signature, and in the lower right corner, are flattened and seem to have a canvas or board texture impressed into the surface (fig. 31.37, fig. 31.38). This could also be related to transport or stacking of paintings while the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes including 0.5 cm and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, iron oxide, vermilion, red lake, viridian, emerald green, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence suggests the use of red lake throughout the landscape.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1997 and left unvarnished. The origin of the varnish layer that was removed is not known (see ). The painting has a relatively dry, matte surface in most areas, with some subtle variations in gloss depending on the qualities of the paint.\n\nA receipt of object report in the conservation file indicates that the work was submitted to the Art Institute in 1943 for \u201ccleaning and repair.\u201d There is no documentation of what work was carried out.\n\nPrior to acquisition, the painting was mounted onto a one-sixteenth-inch metal panel composed of zinc and copper, backed with a second canvas, and mounted on a five-membered wood stretcher. The tacking margins were probably removed at this time. A synthetic varnish was probably also applied at this time.\n\nIn 1997, the varnish was removed, and the painting was left unvarnished. Wax residues were removed mechanically. Minor inpainting was carried out.\n\nThe painting is in good condition overall but suffers from past conservation treatment: the canvas has been mounted onto a one-sixteenth-inch solid-metal (zinc/copper) support; the metal support was then mounted onto a canvas and stretched onto the current stretcher. The original tacking margins were removed, probably at the time of this treatment. The painting does not appear to have been cut down in the process, as a border of unpainted ground is visible on all four sides. There is some flattening and moating of impasto, probably caused by the lining procedure. There are a few small losses in the upper paint layers, apparently the result of interlayer cleavage between the earlier painting campaign and the intermediate white layer applied before the final painting was executed. There is a general network of fine mechanical cracks, as well as localized areas of drying cracks throughout the painting. There is localized retouching in the sky and intermittently around the edges of the painting. The painting is currently unvarnished and has a generally matte appearance.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame with carved running acanthus leaves, plain hollow, and leaf-tip sight molding (Paul Mitchell Ltd., London 1995). The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso. The hollow is burnished, while selective burnishing and a heavier rub were applied to the carved ornament. The frame is heavily toned with final washes of umber and gray with dark flecking. The carved jelutong molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetail splines. The molding from perimeter to interior, is cove side; convex face with carved running acanthus leaves; fillet with rocked recutting; hollow; fillet with rocked recutting; and ogee with carved leaf-tip sight (fig. 31.39).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1980; removed in 1995): The work was previously housed in a stylized, American, mid-twentieth-century frame based on a Louis XV reverse ogee profile (fig. 31.40).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Isidore Montaignac, Paris, May 1899.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Potter (Bertha Honor\u00e9) Palmer, Chicago.\n\nBy descent from Mrs. Potter (Bertha Honor\u00e9) Palmer (died 1918), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nBy descent in the Palmer family to Mrs. Arthur M.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that resulted from the research for the exhibition 1995 exhibition Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) and from consulting several Monet scholars. See Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, Mar. 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. The painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nPossibly May 1891: Meule. (Hiver.) (Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Claude Monet, exh. cat. [Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1891], p. 16, cat. 11; according to Richard R. Brettell, \u201cMonet\u2019s Haystacks Reconsidered,\u201d Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 11, 1 [Fall 1984], p. 7. This identification is not presented by Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 [Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996], pp. 495, cat. 1283 [ill.]; 501).\n\nThe painting was dated 1890/91 by James N. Wood and Douglas Druick; see Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, March 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. This range includes the inscribed date of 1891 and allows for the possibility that Monet began the painting in 1890.\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (normal light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe paint mixture, which includes reddish-brown, green, and yellow paint, is incompletely mixed and varies across the signature and date. XRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination, indicates that the paint mixtures include vermilion, lead white, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, and viridian; other pigments may also be present in the mixture. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings examined for this project, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a more sketchy state, with areas of ground left exposed. John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171, notes that \u201cMonet\u2019s stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 . . . insisted on several occasions that, in the studio, \u2018[Monet] signed his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe tacking edges were removed in a conservation treatment carried out prior to the acquisition of the paintng. The canvas fibers were not sampled.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were estimated from the edges of the painted composition.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet Stack of Wheat (W1283/1983.29),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThe metal panel was found by XRF to contain zinc and copper, possibly brass or a zinc-plated copper; see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. &gt;The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1983\\_29\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 19, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe intermediate white layer was found to contain a mixture of zinc white and lead white; see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Since the brushstrokes related to the intermediate layer appear somewhat opaque in the X-ray, this may indicate that the paint used was a mixture of zinc white and lead white.\n\nThe bright reds and greens in the foreground of Stack of Wheat are reminiscent of the palette used in Poppy Field (Giverny) (cat. 26 [W1253], inv. 1922.4465). A similar change in palette was observed in Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFurthermore, it was not possible to study the painting with transmitted light or transmitted infrared because it has been mounted onto a metal panel (see Conservation History).\n\nZinc white appears to be limited to the intermediate layer applied over the earlier composition. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1983\\_29\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 19, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, zinc white, cadmium yellow, iron oxide, vermilion, viridian, emerald green, and cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, XRF), chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (SEM/EDX). SEM/EDX analysis indicates that the red lake was precipitated on a substrate that contains aluminum and possibly sulfur. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1983\\_29\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 19, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_29\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 72\u201375.\n\nSee receipt of object report, May 21, 1943, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Faye Wrubel, treatment report, Mar. 1997, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nKirk Vuillemot, \u201cMonet Frame Descriptions Final,\u201d Dec. 3, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAccording to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 495, cat. 1283 (ill.); 501, the painting may have been sold as Meule, temps gris.
