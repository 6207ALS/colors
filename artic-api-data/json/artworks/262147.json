    "description": "<p>The Art Alliance of America was concerned with the state of industrial arts in America and was established to raise public awareness of the lack of artistic creativity in manufactured goods and to bring artists and craftsmen to the attention of industry. The AAA also proposed a new educational system to support improved product design and advertising. The scrapbook is a compilation of various newspaper clippings, pamphlets, and invitations regarding the establishment of the Art Alliance of America in the Midwest, as well as a catalog of an AAA exhibition in New York featuring twenty-six industrial arts schools. The clippings span the years 1918, when the first hearing on the creation of a Central States chapter took place, to 1919, when the first exhibition exemplifying the ideals of the group was opened.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Art%20Alliance%20of%20America%20Scrapbook/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
