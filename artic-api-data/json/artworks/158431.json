    "description": "<p>Much like the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93957\">Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition Quilt</a> in our collection, this quilt features a promotional handkerchief. Here the handkerchief, which is placed at the center of a four-pointed star, highlights the 1880 presidential ticket of James A. Garfield and Chester B. Arthur, who did indeed win the election (although Garfield was assassinated a mere six months after taking office). The pattern and color of the design appear celebratory, but in the late nineteenth century, campaigns and elections were beset by problems similar to those of the present day, including factionalized parties, close election results, and discussion and debate comparing the popular vote to the Electoral College, as well as uncompelling and scandalous candidates.</p>\n",
