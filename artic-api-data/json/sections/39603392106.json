Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as in this fourth-state impression. The group spans the entire Noa Noa Suite, with representative impressions printed with the same combination of materials and techniques from each of the ten blocks. After satisfactorily arriving at this composition on the block, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color on paper using oil-based media, some that contain beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them. Previously thought to be a third-state impression, the print is instead a fourth-state impression with additional work on the block described in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9; however, this work is obscured by the various media applied to the block or hand-applied to the paper after printing.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 58.3.2).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 58.3.3).\n\nFive different layers of media are present in this print. Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from a piece of glass. The printing ink used for this layer has a rather fluid appearance, and it was applied to specific areas. The second layer is an oil-based medium, and combines chrome yellow, vermilion, and orange (chrome yellow and vermilion) (see fig. 58.3.4 and fig. 58.3.5). It, too, was applied to the paper site specifically by means of transfer from the glass. However, in this layer the minute particles of media have a thick, dimensional appearance indicative of the wax and resin they contain. Atop these two layers of colored media, the block was printed twice, first in a golden-brown printing ink that contains carbon black, chrome yellow or chrome orange, and some clay, then in black printing ink (a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue). The artist completed the print with touches of hand-applied dark-yellow and brown gouache.\n\nThe paper is a good-quality, medium-weight Japanese paper that has a uniform distribution of long paper fibers visible under magnification and in transmitted light. Also visible are the remnants of a secondary support with mottled blue wove paper fibers that is recognizable as one of the artist\u2019s presentation mounts. The sheet was trimmed slightly into the image area on all sides. Smooth and hard sized, the surface is robust enough to withstand the artist\u2019s media transfer and printing methods.\n\nFor the verso of this sheet, see fig. 58.3.1.\n\n357 \u00d7 205 mm (image/sheet)\n\nIn this impression of Te faruru (Here We Make Love), five layers of media are present. To fully assess these layers, surface shape studies were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the topography of the various media as they sit on the surface of the paper (see fig. 58.3.3). The first layer of media applied to the paper was chrome yellow. It was selectively applied by means of transfer from a tone block used to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper or another wood block; however, because of Gauguin\u2019s site-specific intentions, it is more likely that he used a piece of glass for this purpose. The medium appears to have been applied in a semifluid consistency. Its even appearance and uniform dispersion onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. Application of the yellow printing ink is site specific; the glass was used so that the artist could see where he wished to place the ink to achieve this degree of specificity. By positioning the glass over the block, Gauguin could accurately locate the yellow in the areas in which he wanted it to appear. In this impression it is most obvious behind the figures to the right, where diagonal contours separate light from dark (fig. 58.3.6); however, under magnification yellow particles are visible throughout much of the sheet.\n\nIn a second layer of media transferred from glass, orange and red predominate. Here, minute particles of transferred media sit on the surface of the paper atop the more fluid yellow layer below. The dimensionality of the medium is more pronounced in raking light. Examination under magnification and gentle probing with a needle reveal that the medium has a waxy consistency, and indeed, the oil-based medium was found to contain some beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin). It is possible that Gauguin took advantage of the properties of the wax-and-resin-containing medium by applying it to the glass while warm and then allowing it to cool and partially harden before transferring it to paper. When the artist placed the sheet of paper that now carried the yellow tone back on top of the glass and rubbed it, he transferred seemingly random dispersions of islands of encrusted media onto the sheet. Examination under magnification reveals that there is a significant amount of red media in the foreground (fig. 58.3.7), while orange predominates in the background (fig. 58.3.8). The absence of this waxy medium, on the most part, from the upper right is clearly intentional and provides evidence that glass was used not only as a support to carry the media but also as a means to achieve site-specificity.\n\nWith the second layer of media now on the paper, Gauguin positioned the sheet on top of the wood block, which he had inked with golden brown, and pulled an impression. Following this, he reinked the block in black, modifying the composition manually by wiping black ink from the block so that much of the golden-brown and transferred red ink below would remain visible when printed. The deep velvety-black background is punctuated by a broad sweep of golden brown to the left of the figures, achieved by wiping some of the black ink from the block to reveal that passage. Here, more so than in any other block in the Noa Noa Suite, the artist worked to subtract media from very specific areas to articulate the contours of the forms in the foreground. He established a consistent visual vocabulary in many first- and second-state impressions by simply wiping ink from the block to define the locations of arms, legs, and the contour of the male figure\u2019s back. In later states, as here, these locations are fixed by incisions into the wood block. The contour of the back, however, remains a form that is constantly changed by the artist, never fixed with a deeply incised stroke to articulate its length (fig. 58.3.9).\n\nGauguin deliberately repositioned the paper so that the black-ink impression would be printed askew of the golden-brown impression (fig. 58.3.10), and in a final gesture, he hand applied deep-yellow and brown gouache blended with not-yet-dry ink into uninked areas of the figure\u2019s leg to cast it into shadow (fig. 58.3.11). The artist\u2019s approach here was deliberate; his materials and their application were well thought-out to achieve the desired tonal and textural variations evident in the work. What at first glance appears to be a spontaneously executed production is instead a well-considered methodology borne of an sessment of the materials, their diverse mechanical properties, and their distinctive appearance when transferred onto a paper surface.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103\n\nOn the states documented in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints, see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), cat. 15.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon. To return to the original view, click on the return icon (semicircle with arrow).\n\nThis method of transfer is clearly the precursor to the watercolor and oil transfer methods that Gauguin adopted moving forward (see, for example, cat. 68 and cat. 124).

In this impression, because the bright-yellow medium appears to be of a semifluid consistency, it could not have been transferred from a paper carrier. The paper itself would have absorbed much more media than it would have released in the transfer process and the resulting transfer would not have been as distinct and media rich.\n\nThe organic media in the paint were analyzed using THM-Py-GCMS and found to be an oil-based medium, some with beeswax and Pinaceae resin present in varying amounts in different prints.
