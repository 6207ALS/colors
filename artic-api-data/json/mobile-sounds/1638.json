    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This extraordinary evocation of the crucifixion is by the Spanish 17th century artist Zurbaran.  Christ's body is depicted with an incredible realism, intended to inspire a profound spiritual response.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: Within Spanish devotional painting of this period, there's a great religious fervor.  This scene has been pared down to a dark background, and the focus really is on the agony and suffering of the crucified Christ.<br />\nNarrator:  This altarpiece was painted for a monastery in the southern Spanish city of Seville.  Zurbaran designed it to hang above an altar in the tiny sacristy which was screened by an iron grille.  This space for preparations before the mass was lit by windows to the right, whose illumination Zurbaran mimics and intensifies in the painting.  A later 17th century art historian and painter, Antonio Palomino, was deeply impressed with its astonishingly convincing depiction of Christ's dying body.  He wrote: &quot;There is a crucifix from his, Zurbaran's, hand, which is shown behind a grille of the chapel, which has little light, and everyone who sees it and does not know believes it to be sculpture.&quot;</p>\n",
