For once the army seemed contrite; instead of acclaiming yet another of themselves as ruler of Rome, they asked the Senate to choose. After an interregnum of nearly half a year, during which Aurelian\u2019s widow Severina may have ruled, the Senate approved Tacitus, who immediately got to work on the borders of Germania and in Gaul. He did not arrive in Rome until December 275, after which the mint engravers in Rome and then in Ticinum (Pavia) were able to show not the youthful warrior they first imagined, but a genuine portrait of the jowly and mature general. That portrait is seen on this coin.\n\nThe silver content and overall weight of this aurelianus, as the reformed antoninianus is known, is still quite low, indicating the severe inflation that devastated the third century. Aurelian\u2019s reform of the coinage was slow to take hold, and many mints especially in the West neglected to mark the new coins with XX/I, which would have differentiated them from the unreformed coin in circulation (this coin does not have that mark); the actual silver content and weight vary wildly (this one is on the low side). However, the relative care in striking and the wide variety of reverse types during the few short months of Tacitus\u2019s reign indicate a resolve on the part of Rome to keep up appearances as well as keep the troops paid. Reverse inscriptions of Tacitus\u2019s reign include \u201cLoyalty of the troops,\u201d \u201cEternal peace,\u201d \u201cRestorer of the world,\u201d and \u201cHappy times,\u201d as well as wishes that the aged emperor would live twenty years\u2014all of which sound rather optimistic under the circumstances. The reverse of this coin proclaims the providentia augusta, \u201cprovidence (foresight) of the emperor,\u201d or perhaps of the gods, in directing the affairs of the world. The obverse inscription reads \u201cImp[erator] C[aesar] M[arcus] Cl[audius] Tacitus Aug[ustus].\u201d The imperial titles added to his own personal names (Marcus Claudius) handily evoked both the Julio-Claudian and the Antonine dynasties of the golden past, though he was of course descended from neither of them.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Estiot, Catalogue des monnaies de l\u2019Empire romain; see also Estiot and Mairat, \u201cRIC Temp #3434.\u201d\n\nSee an extended exploration of the coinage reforms at Estiot and Mairat, \u201cMonetary System.\u201d\n\nThe Q in the reverse inscription is most likely the mint mark.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 68 Aurelianus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Tacitus, A.D. 276\n\n</section>",
