    "description": "<p>As of\ufb01cial painter of the Apostolic Apartments, Bernardino Nocchi produced large fresco decorations for the papal residences at the Vatican. However, this painting is a re\ufb02ection of his association with the great Neoclassical sculptor <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33858/antonio-canova\">Antonio Canova</a>\u2014and of Canova\u2019s exacting working process, which involved two-dimensional preparatory works as well as studies in terracotta and plaster. The plaster model was a key element in Canova\u2019s design process, serving as the basis for adjustments before the \ufb01nal execution in marble. In a few instances, as here, Canova also commissioned paintings based on the plaster model, both to show to the patron and to anticipate the effects of light on the three-dimensional work. The plaster model for this tomb design survives in the Gipsoteca Canoviana, Possagno, Italy, but a large marble was never made. A <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25221/deposition\">reduced replica</a> made for a Venetian patron by Antonio d\u2019Este, the head of Canova\u2019s workshop, is also in the collection of the Art Institute.</p>\n",
