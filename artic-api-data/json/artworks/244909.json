The drawing\u2019s most finished side is divided into three scenes. The dead Christ is mourned by his followers at center. His tomb is prepared for his burial at left, and the bodies of the good and bad thieves\u2014the two thieves who were crucified alongside Christ\u2014are carried away at upper right. The sheet\u2019s less-finished side contains a variation on the lamentation scene on the drawing\u2019s front.</p>\n<p>Although he was influenced by his master, Raphael, Polidoro later adopted a style of drawing in pen and ink characterized by reduced forms made of agitated strokes and rapid hatching, as seen here.</p>\n",
