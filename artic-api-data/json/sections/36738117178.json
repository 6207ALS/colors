Braude Memorial Collection, 2013.986\n\nThe year 1890 marked significant milestones for Claude Monet\u2019s personal and professional career. In November he purchased the house in Giverny he had rented since 1883; the property and gardens there, which he went on to manicure and expand, would be a life-long source of inspiration. It was also in 1890 that the established leader of the Impressionists began work on his Stacks of Wheat. Although the concept of painting in series had occupied him for some time, this group marked a pivotal shift in his practice. Moreover, he established a new way of presenting his pictures when, in May 1891, fifteen Stacks featured in an exhibition at Durand-Ruel.\n\nMonet executed the approximately twenty-five canvases that make up the series proper\u2014six of which are now in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago\u2014likely between late August or early September 1890 and February 1891. As his work on the paintings drew to a close he made two drawings on the theme. He found his motif, with its hilly, tree-dotted backdrop, in a field adjacent to his property (fig. 1). The compositional placement of the stacks was of interest to Monet, as was his concern for getting their shapes just right. But perhaps more importantly, their form in the landscape served as a vehicle for formal experimentation: a chance to explore the enveloppe, the ephemeral and constantly changing atmospheric conditions that transformed his chosen scene.\n\nIn what may be Monet\u2019s earliest account of his work on the Stacks of Wheat, he touched on key points that distinguished the series from his previous efforts. \u201cI\u2019m working away at a series of different effects (of stacks), but at this time of year, the sun sets so quickly that I can\u2019t keep up with it,\u201d Monet explained to his friend Gustave Geffroy on October 7, 1890. \u201cI\u2019m becoming so slow in my work that it makes me despair, but the further I go, the better I see that it takes a great deal of work to succeed in rendering what I want to render: \u2018instantaneity,\u2019 above all the enveloppe, the same light diffused over everything, and I\u2019m more than ever disgusted at things that come easily, at the first attempt.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Monet called his new paintings a \u201cseries\u201d appears to be a tantalizing self-reflection as he embarked on what would be a transformation in his practice, yet this was by no means the first time he had applied the label to his work. In fact, by the mid-1870s, Monet used it regularly to describe his versions of paintings on the same motif, such as his views of the Gare Saint-Lazare (see cat. 16 [W440]). A more significant point lies instead in his confession that his recent paintings did not come quickly or easily to him\u2014and that he welcomed the challenge. If he hoped to depict \u201cinstantaneity,\u201d somewhat ironically, it would take time. Tellingly, too, he worked up the Stacks of Wheat as a group, partially en plein air, partially in his studio. Soon this novel methodology\u2014selecting isolated motifs to paint repeatedly under different atmospheric conditions\u2014would become his typical working method.\n\nAs early as 1892, Monet reflected on this change in his practice, stating that his new aim was to explore \u201cmore serious qualities\u201d in his art. But, as many art historians have noted, Monet\u2019s choice of wheat stacks and other motifs, while formal exercises, often resonated deeply with the social context in which he lived and worked. After a period of extensive travel in the 1880s, Monet\u2019s age, financial security and home ownership, seem to have reinvigorated his interest in depicting nearby rural themes. In picking the stacks of wheat as a subject, however, as Impressionist scholar Robert Herbert has argued, Monet tapped into the motif\u2019s nuanced meaning within the local community at the time. \u201cIt is not a \u2018haystack\u2019 at all, but a grain stack,\u201d Herbert clarified. \u201cHaystacks . . . have slightly irregular, less architectural shapes. Grain stacks are built more carefully, their shocks first tied together and then actually thatched to keep the rain out . . . We are therefore not looking at ordinary hay, but at Stacks of Wheat (to give them their real title), wheat which was literally the wealth of its owners.\u201d Later, Paul Tucker noted that Monet also connected with the patriotism and nostalgia that endeared images of the fertile and abundant French countryside to French society in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nMonet worked to promote the Stacks of Wheat in advance of the exhibition. Early in 1891, he agreed to provide Octave Mirbeau with illustrations for an article in L\u2019art dans les deux mondes. Mirbeau had been deeply affected by his experience of the works: \"We couldn\u2019t tear ourselves away from contemplation of your Stacks, whose fair dream seems to expand, deepen to infinity.\u201d He assured his friend that he would stay true to his subject: \u201cDo believe me that in this article, in prophesizing the Monet you will become, I\u2019ll be careful not to forget the one you are.\u201d After the text appeared in print, however, Mirbeau reproached the publishers (who had held back proofs he wanted to amend). Nonetheless, this does not detract from the fact that the article marked an important moment in the critical reception of the works; the drawing that accompanied the text (see fig. 2, now in the National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo) is remarkably similar to the Art Institute\u2019s sheet.\n\nMonet based the Tokyo drawing on a painting of 1890 (now in the Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Conn. [fig. 3]). The Hill-Stead painting may well have prompted the Art Institute sheet, too, though it is difficult to establish which of the drawings came first. They are remarkably similar in detail, but it seems logical that the Chicago sheet was the earlier attempt, given that Monet\u2014who made very few drawings at this stage of his career\u2014would probably have been loath to make two studies if he had been satisfied with the first. Furthermore, in the Tokyo work the more abstract background lends prominence to the stacks. This simplification would have suited the purposes of reproduction, although Monet\u2019s rendition of trees and buildings is perhaps more faithful to the painted composition.\n\nThat Monet was challenged by the task of creating a representative image of Stacks of Wheat for print purposes is perhaps unsurprising. Monet\u2019s painted images are characterized by their subtle variations of tone and their complex, textured surfaces, whereas black-and-white illustrations with distinct, clearly defined contrasts of light and dark tend to reproduce best. Monet adopted a monochrome palette but, by using soft black chalk in his drawing, avoided harsh contours. To mimic his distinctive stippled brushwork, he used a technique called frottage whereby the sheet is placed on an object and then rubbed to register the object\u2019s textured surface. He outlined the stacks with wavering strokes and used stumping to work the chalk into the paper, creating an image with its own unique appeal.\n\nFor most commenters on the first exhibition of the Stacks of Wheat paintings at Durand-Ruel in May 1891, it was the installation that garnered discussion. In the preface to the accompanying catalogue, Gustave Geffroy noted that \u201cthe grouping together of fifteen canvases of haystacks, each representing the same subject, with a rendition of the same landscape, is an extraordinarily victorious artistic demonstration . . . [Monet] conveys the sensation of the ephemeral instant that comes into existence and never again returns, and at the same time, he constantly evokes in each of his canvases\u2014through the weight, the power that comes out from the curve of the horizon, the roundness of the terrestrial globe\u2014the course of the earth through space.\u201d Dutch critic Willem G. C. Byvanck noted that the individual paintings \u201cacquire their full value by comparison [to the others] and in the succession of the full series.\u201d Little is known about the exact arrangement of the canvases in the show, for there are no extant photographs to confirm whether the works were hung sequentially by season, by size, or by another ordering principle. But what is known, from these accounts and others, is that fifteen Stacks of Wheat were shown together at Durand-Ruel\u2019s gallery in one small room, a new strategy for the exhibition of Monet\u2019s works. In addition, two of Monet\u2019s 1886 figure paintings of a woman holding a parasol were reportedly hung above the row of Stacks; elsewhere in the room, Monet included four field pictures from 1890 and one painting from the Creuse series (see cat. 25).\n\nThe Art Institute holds the world\u2019s largest number of Stacks, which offers an unprecedented opportunity to compare technical findings and thereby rethink long-standing assessments of the series. Scholars have sought to identify an underlying logic to the Stacks of Wheat series. This is a particularly difficult task since, as the art historian Paul Tucker has noted, Monet often manipulated public accounts of his working method\u2014and nowhere more so than with regard to the Stacks of Wheat. Tucker has written that Monet \u201cclearly wanted to establish the fact that he was not a programmatic artist, that he operated on instinct rather than intellect, and that he simply applied those instincts to the dictates of nature.\u201d\n\nGeffroy\u2019s preface in the Durand-Ruel exhibition catalogue, together with Monet\u2019s atmospherically and seasonally precise titles for the works in the show, has led to the misconception that the paintings \u201cchart the passage of the sun across the stacks with such specificity that they collectively form a kind of chronometer.\u201d As mentioned above, art historians noted long ago that Monet\u2019s Stacks of Wheat were not executed quickly and on the spot but were rather the result of multiple sessions, with the artist making calculated and careful changes in his studio. Scholars have noted that underlying brushwork does not match up to forms on the surface, and pentimenti in numerous paintings reveal that Monet even moved the locations of his stacks within compositions.\n\nRecent technical examinations of the Art Institute\u2019s six Stacks paintings support these contentions. All show evidence that Monet made changes to the paintings over the course of multiple working sessions. In Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269]), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270]), and Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284]), for example, Monet adjusted the shapes and sizes of the stacks and the placement of the horizon and houses in the background. Of these three, Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) shows the most dramatic change: X-ray and transmitted-infrared imaging reveal that Monet radically reduced the width of the stack (fig. 4). In some canvases, like Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (fig. 5) (cat. 29 [W1278]), Monet changed the placement of the stacks significantly, while in others, like Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281]), he removed one whole stack entirely (fig. 6).\n\nPerhaps even more significantly, two of the Art Institute\u2019s paintings, Stacks of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) and Stack of Wheat (cat. 31 [W1283]), both executed on no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvases, may have initially featured stacks in a different season or may have been painted over different compositions altogether. The two paintings reveal that, in initial layers, the landscape was at least partially green in places (fig. 7 and fig. 8), suggesting that the scenes did not originate as snowy ones from the winter of 1890\u201391 but rather from an earlier time in the year when the grass was still green. Losses in Stack of Wheat also reveal areas in which a vibrant red color appears. In each of these paintings, Monet covered the earlier composition with white paint that obscured the forms and textures of the painting underneath. The palette of the earlier layers suggests that these paintings could have begun as one of the paintings from summer 1890, featuring the oats, hay, or poppies that surrounded Monet\u2019s property at Giverny (see cat. 26 [W1253]), that were put aside by the end of August when Monet began his Stacks of Wheat canvases. The similarity in palette and canvas size indicates that Stacks of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) and Stack of Wheat may have begun in a fashion that was more analogous to works like Monet\u2019s Prairie \u00e0 Giverny (Prairie at Giverny) (fig. 9 [W1247]) or Champ d\u2019avoine (Oat Field) (fig. 10 [W1259]).\n\nRecognizing that Monet made such extensive changes to his paintings seems to have discouraged some art historians from theorizing any internal logic to the Stacks paintings. In his groundbreaking catalogue of Monet\u2019s series paintings from the 1890s, Paul Tucker noted that the Stacks of Wheat paintings \u201care not all the same dimensions\u201d and that \u201cMonet clearly did not feel obliged to choose a particular-size canvas for a particular effect, season, or stack configuration.\u201d New technical evidence from the Art Institute\u2019s paintings, however, suggest that we revisit this theory as possible patterns in Monet\u2019s Stacks of Wheat may, in fact, be discerned.\n\nMonet consistently used four canvas sizes for his Stacks of Wheat paintings. Five paintings are executed on a non-standard-size format (60 \u00d7 100 cm; fig. 11); seven are painted on standard-size no. 40 marine format canvases (65 \u00d7 100 cm; fig. 12); nine are on standard-size no. 30 paysage format canvases; (65 \u00d7 92 cm; fig. 13) and four are executed on standard-size no. 30 figure format canvases (73 \u00d7 92 cm; fig. 14). Notwithstanding some exceptions, basic patterns emerge at first glance: four out of the five non-standard-size canvases (60 \u00d7 100 cm) feature two separated stacks of different sizes; six out of the seven works on no. 40 marine size canvases feature two stacks, although their placement is not consistent; the majority of the paintings on no. 30 paysage canvases depict single stacks; and finally, the standard no. 30 figure format canvases were reserved for those paintings depicting extremely close-up views of stacks that extend beyond the right or left edges of the picture plane.\n\nWhile certain anomalies to these patterns are visible on the final canvases, features underneath the surfaces of these paintings must be further explored to advance the possibility that Monet might have started the Stacks more programmatically. For example, the Art Institute\u2019s Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) complicates the suggestion that the no. 30 paysage canvases could have been primarily reserved for single-stack compositions. While infrared reflectography shows that Monet did at one time have a second stack located to the right of the stack in the final canvas, it is not clear that that second stack was included from the very beginning. X-ray shows that the landscape once extended beneath the stack, possibly indicating that the work started as a single-stack work before a second stack was added and later painted out.\n\nWhile most of the no. 40 marine size canvases feature two stacks, those in Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) [cat. 29] as well as Grainstacks in the Sunlight, Midday ([W1271]) are positioned differently from the others. Technical analysis of the former, however, shows that originally Monet did have the two stacks placed much more in line with those in the other pictures in this group. Research has also shown that the stack extending past the edge of the left side of the canvas in Grainstacks in the Sunlight, Midday had also been moved from a position that looked more like the other pictures in the group.\n\nMuch has been written about the Stacks of Wheat as a unified group, and rightly so, for, as John House argues, \u201cIn exhibiting his series, Monet explored the possibilities of large pictorial ensembles, with the individual canvas an integral part of a larger entity . . . the cumulative effect he sought in his exhibitions began to affect the ways in which he executed his canvases, whereas before he had finished them piecemeal and without thought of establishing such an inner coherence. As much as the individual paintings themselves, the ensembles of his exhibitions became the end product towards which he worked.\u201d While it is important\u2014as House notes\u2014that we consider Monet\u2019s execution of the series as a group, the Art Institute\u2019s analysis of its six Stacks of Wheat suggests that we should not ignore the complexities of the individual paintings. The techniques Monet used are tremendously varied and reveal the extent to which he labored over each work.\n\nAll of the Art Institute\u2019s Stacks began on canvases that were probably commercially prepared and primed with an off-white ground. Technical examination shows that Monet exploited the tone of the ground to different extents. In Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer), for example, Monet used open brushwork throughout the painting, allowing areas of the ground to be exposed (fig. 15); in Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) and Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) the paint layers are more densely built up, and even in areas that are very thinly painted, the color of the ground is mostly obscured (fig. 16 and fig. 17). Also of particular note are canvases like Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn), and Stack of Wheat, in which Monet built up the sky using undulating zigzag strokes, much like those that he would also use to execute his Sandvika (cat. 34); in other Stacks, these distinctive strokes in the sky are not visible. Paintings like Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) juxtapose thick impasto with very thinly painted passages and sometimes use paint that appears to have been manipulated by the artist to increase the fluidity (see Technical Report), while others like Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) incorporate very little impasto, resulting in a brushmarked but relatively flat surface. Stacks of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) is significantly different from the other Stacks paintings since Monet built up the surface of the foreground from dark to light. Whereas the other works were typically laid in with subdued tones and then built up using more intense color, in this canvas the artist also wiped or scraped areas of the canvas in an effort to expose underlying paint layers. This sample of the varying techniques Monet employed in the Art Institute\u2019s Stacks. The Art Institute\u2019s technical studies of its Stacks paintings pose more questions than answers, but one thing is clear: the varying techniques Monet employed in the works illustrate their incredibly experimental quality. The complex surface of each canvas suggests that the paintings in the series are not as homogeneous as is often assumed.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (W 1269) corresponds to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 483; 485, cat. 1269 (ill.).

Monet had included haystacks in a number of paintings between 1884 and 1887 as well as stacks of wheat in about five paintings of 1888\u201389. The paintings from 1884 and 1887 are Haystacks, Night Effect (1884; Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow [W900]); Haystacks, Hazy Sun (1884; private collection, Switzerland [W901]); Haystacks at Giverny (1884; Tsuneshi Suzuki, Japan [W902]); The Haystacks at Giverny (1885; private collection [W993]); The Haystack (1885; Ohara Museum of Art, Kurashiki, Okayama, Japan [W994]); Field at Giverny (1885; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston [W995]); A Haystack (1886; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W1073]); View of Giverny (1886; private collection, France [W1074]); Landscape at Giverny (1886\u201387; sale, Christie\u2019s, New York, Nov. 11, 1992, no. 39 [W1123]); and Field at Giverny (1887; sale, Sotheby\u2019s, New York, May 2, 2012, no. 35 [W1124]). The 1888\u201389 paintings are Grainstacks at Giverny, Sunset (1888; Saitama Museum of Modern Art, Urawa-shi, Japan [W1213]); Grainstacks at Giverny, Morning Effect (1889; sale, Sotheby\u2019s, New York, May 1, 1996, no. 23 [W1214]); Grainstacks, White Frost Effect (1889; Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Conn.

(Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1989), pp. 71, 74, 77. The dating of when Monet began the Stacks of Wheat is based on the letter Monet wrote to Gustave Geffroy on October 7, 1890. John House, for example, believes the first Stacks of Wheat canvases presumably date to late September or early October 1890 See John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 199. Assessing four of Monet\u2019s letters from the last week of August 1890, in which the artist describes his preoccupation with his work, Tucker (p. 74) concludes that Stacks of Wheat were begun at least a month or two earlier than the October 7, 1890, letter to Geffroy.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), pp. 220\u201321.\n\nMonet to Gustave Geffroy, Oct. 7, 1890, quoted in John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 198; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 3, Peintures, 1887\u20131898 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 258, letter 1076.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 193.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 201.

As Jim Ganz noted in James A. Ganz and Richard Kendall, The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings, exh. cat. (Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 2007), pp. 207\u201308, the Tokyo drawing was somewhat compromised in its gillotage printed form, being cropped in the upper and lower registers, which compressed the image into an oblong rectangle.\n\nGustave Geffroy, Exposition Claude Monet, exh. cat.

Seiberling (p. 100) has noted that while Monet had shown groups of related works (the Gare Saint-Lazare paintings, for example) in a single exhibition, there is no evidence that they were hung together. The installation of Stacks of Wheat at Durand-Ruel in May 1891 was likely also informed by the dealer, who employed novel exhibition installations to remain competitive in the increasingly diverse and developed Paris art market. See Martha Ward, \u201cImpressionist Installations and Private Exhibitions,\u201d Art Bulletin 73, 4 (Dec. 1991), pp. 616\u201318.\n\nPaul Tucker identifies Le Bloc, Creuse (1889; Royal Collection, Britain [W1228]) as the Creuse painting that was exhibited.

The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nStacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29) and Grainstack, Sun in the Mist (1891; Minneapolis Institute of Arts [W1286]) are aberrations in this group. Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) features two unseparated stacks and Grainstack, Sun in the Mist only depicts one stack.

Both depict two stacks, one large one overlapping a smaller one behind it. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nWith one exception: Grainstack, Sun in the Mist (1891; Minneapolis Institute of Arts [W1286]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\n\"The extent to which Monet made changes in some of the Haystacks is made clear by close examination of the surface of Grainstacks in the Sunlight, Midday (1890; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra [W1271]). Pentimenti reveal that the smaller haystack was moved from a position between the two haystacks as they appear now; furthermore, the contours of the larger stack were enlarged twice, almost doubling its original size.\u201d In Charles S. Moffett, \u201cMonet\u2019s Haystacks,\u201d in Aspects of Monet: A Symposium on the Artist\u2019s Life and Times, ed. John Rewald and Frances Weitzenhoffer (Abrams, 1984), p. 146. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996). While these may not be the only anomalies to the groupings proposed here, this evidence calls for the owners of those exceptional cases to contribute to these theories through their own technical examinations to see if it is possible to determine another facet of just how \u201cprogrammatic\u201d or not Monet was with this series.\n\nJohn House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 216.\n\nThis is a difficult concept to assess across all of the Art Institute\u2019s canvases. As mentioned above, in two of the Stacks paintings, Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30) and Stack of Wheat (cat. 31), Monet blocked out evidence of an earlier composition by applying a layer of white. This layer would certainly have contributed to the amount of ground (or lack thereof) showing through in the final composition. At some point in its conservation history, the canvas on which Stack of Wheat was painted was mounted to a solid metal support; as such, analysis of the painting with transmitted light is futile.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Paintings and drawing by Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926), starting from top left: Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer), 1890/91 (cat. 27); Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn), 1890/91 (cat. 28); Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect), 1890/91 (cat. 29); Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day), 1890/91 (cat. 30); Stack of Wheat, 1890/91 (cat. 31); Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset), 1890/91 (cat. 32); Stacks of Wheat, 1891 (cat. 33).\n\nfig. 1 Photograph of the view from Monet\u2019s second studio, c. 1905, from L\u2019art et les artistes, Dec. 1905, p. 90.\n\nfig. 2 Claude Monet (French, 1840\u20131926).
