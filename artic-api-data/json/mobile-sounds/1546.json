    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the foreground of this serene landscape, St. John the Evangelist sits writing the Book of Revelation, the visionary last book of the New Testament in the Christian Bible. An eagle, St. John's traditional symbol, stands behind him. The saint himself represents the advent of the new Christian faith which will replace the fallen pagan beliefs alluded to by the classical ruins around him. The painting was made by the great 17th century French artist Nicolas Poussin in Rome, where he spent much of his working life. This is a perfect example of Poussin's idealized classical landscapes, which he constructs with a sense of clarity and geometry. Notice how the path behind St. John zigzags its way back into the middle distance, the trees diminishing in size to help create a sense of depth. Meanwhile, the upright form of the classical pedestal near the saint is echoed by that of the tall tree behind it, and again by the ancient temple columns and obelisks in the distance. Poussin's work was highly appreciated by cultivated classically educated collectors among the Roman and French aristocracy. Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: He and his admirers were very much drawn to a stoic philosophy, and so the rationality of the landscape and the calmness of it were probably very appealing.</p>\n",
