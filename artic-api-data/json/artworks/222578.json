    "description": "<p>Johann Elias Ridinger, a prolific Augsburg etcher of animals, set up his own printing house in the 1720s, eventually creating a market for his realistic portraits and allegories that stretched across Europe and into Britain. Hunting scenes, including both animals and aristocratic figures, were one of his specialties. This drawing, <em>Spring</em>, and its pendant <em><a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/222581\">Winter</a></em>, come from a series depicting hunters across the four seasons. The hunter portrayed here holds a heron and a rifle as he contentedly gazes at his bounty of deer, rabbits, and other birds.</p>\n",
