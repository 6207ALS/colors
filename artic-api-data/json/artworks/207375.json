    "description": "<p>In 1969, at the invitation of Munich gallery owner Heiner Friedrich, sculptor Michael Heizer drove a backhoe to dig a pit more than 30 meters in diameter: geometry writ large on the landscape. As an extension of the work, called <em>Munich Depression,</em> Heizer took 360-degree photographs of the 7,000-square-foot pit and used them to prepare a gigantic slide piece, called <em>Actual Size</em>\u2014a 1:1 virtual recreation of <em>Munich Depression</em> that brought his outdoor intervention into an exhibition space. \u201cI think certain photographs offer a precise way of seeing works,\u201d he said as he was preparing this photo work. \u201cYou can take a photograph into a clean white room, with no sound, no noise. You can . . . possibly experience to a greater depth whatever view you have been presented with.\u201d</p>\n",
