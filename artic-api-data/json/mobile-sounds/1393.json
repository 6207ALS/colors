    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The two figures in this case show some of the foreign influences brought along the Silk Road into China. On the left here, two women look into small hand mirrors. They may be applying makeup which was colored by imported pigments including indigo from Persia, today\u2019s Iran. Notice their garments, fragments of Tang dynasty silks that have been found along the Silk Road display intricate brocaded, printed, embroidered, woven, stenciled and tie-dyed designs. Here rather than reproducing those complex patterns the artist allowed the glazes to flow freely. To the right, you\u2019ll find a pair of Chinese men. One of them holds a small bird. The other may also have held a bird now lost. They may be engaged in falconry a form of hunting that was most popular in Persia. Tang aristocrats imported flocks of falcons and other birds from many areas for pure pleasure, as well as for the hunt. On the far right side of the case, six female musicians play Chinese instruments.  In the front row, from right to left are a Pan pipe, a vertical flute, and symbols. In the backrow, the musician on the right holds a small harp. We don\u2019t know whether the two other women hold instruments or vessels. Their garments which drape like silk are empire-waisted [ph?] with low cut bodices and tight sleeves. This foreign fashion was quite daring compared with traditional Chinese dress which concealed the body under loose heavy robes.</p>\n",
