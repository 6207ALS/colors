    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Conservator, Rachel Sabino.</p>\n<p>Rachel: So here we have this ovid, ivory colored jar. And it has these blue spots, and those are dabs of cobalt oxide that are applied under the glaze and the object is interesting because it foreshadows a moment, which you\u2019ll see around the corner, when cobalt comes into play in a pretty spectacular way.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Practicing ceramic artist, Michael Kaysen.<br>Michael: Interestingly enough, it\u2019s actually a clear glaze. The way to tell that the color is coming mostly from the clay body is, look at where the layer of glaze ends, and it goes-- and you just see the unglazed clay, suddenly the color of the clay pops a little bit.</p>\n<p>Rachel: But the jar is also interesting because it\u2019s such a departure from form the rest of the objects in this case. So these objects, as well as the ones to the right, are pure white and it\u2019s the first time in ceramic history that we see this. And what\u2019s interesting about that is that to meet the eastern definition of porcelain clay has to include two very specific ingredients: The first of those is kaolin, it comes from the mineral kaolinite, and there are huge veins of this in China. And the Chinese were the first to grasp it\u2019s potential in producing a very fine, white clay. You know, you\u2019ll notice that the walls on these vessels are very thin, but if you were to hold them up to the light they wouldn\u2019t be translucent, and that\u2019s because they\u2019re made of almost 100% kaolin. So to get that famous translucency you\u2019ll need something else, which you\u2019ll also see around the corner.</p>\n",
