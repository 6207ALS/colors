Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges or knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis hand-colored, third-state impression of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) is an example of a number that were printed in a later phase of the carving and compositional development of the block, for which the artist adhered two sheets of absorbent Japanese paper together to obtain a surface that accommodated applications of transparent watercolor brushed over printing ink. It is very similar in palette and execution to impressions of Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.2), Te po (The Night) (cat. 52.1), and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.2) in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. Overall, the hand-colored impressions have a more luminous quality that is enhanced by the translucency of the Japanese papers. And it is this very quality that likely appealed to Gauguin when he worked with delicate washes of color. The end results are certainly aesthetically quite different from those impressions in which transferred media predominate. By comparison, impressions colored by the transfer of waxy, resinous media were instead printed on much sturdier papers.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 54.2.2).\n\nThe wood block was printed twice, first in brown ink and then in black ink. The brown ink is a mixture of carbon black, vermilion, chrome orange, and barium white. The artist\u2019s use of the frisket and selective wiping of the block to develop the composition are outlined below (see Compositional Development). Once satisfied with his printed impression, Gauguin washed orange, yellow, red, two tones of green, two tones of blue, silver-gray, and black transparent watercolors onto it (see fig. 54.2.3). The fish in the immediate foreground was brightly colored in vermilion, Prussian blue, silver-gray, and opaque orange (a mixture of vermilion and cadmium yellow) (fig. 54.2.4). This bright orange predominates in the fish, which has a strong presence in the composition as a whole. The figure directly behind the fish was toned with a thicker application of the same silvery gray found in the fish and in numerous other impressions in the Noa Noa Suite. The female figure to the left was toned with washes of red watercolor. Behind her, the sea is Prussian blue, and once-pale-blue waves have now faded almost completely. Plantlike forms at top center are toned with a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow. The assorted forms that dominate the right side of the composition were toned in a variety of colors that include an iron oxide red, cerulean blue, a mixture of cobalt blue and cadmium yellow to make green, and a much-faded yellow. Under ultraviolet light the three waves exhibit a bluish-white fluorescence. There is slight yellow fluorescence in the body of the fish in the foreground. In both of these areas much of the original color is lost. Throughout the print, zinc white is present and was likely used as an extender.\n\nGauguin adhered two sheets of thin Japanese paper together to make a laminate. A thinner wove paper layer lies on top of a slightly heavier laid sheet. The paper mold characteristics of the laid and wove Japanese papers are readily apparent in transmitted light. Homogeneous distribution of long Japanese paper fibers is visible in both sheets. The paper fibers are distributed evenly, and the papers are of a uniform color. The edges of the laminated sheet are straight cut although slightly irregular. The paper has been trimmed close to the printed image; approximately 1\u20132 mm of paper margin remains around the image on all sides.\n\nGauguin selected fibrous, cream-toned Japanese papers for this and a number of other hand-colored impressions, but not without modifying the papers in some way. Often Gauguin would laminate together two distinctly different Japanese papers, one laid and the other wove. Fine vertical creases are visible in all of the laminated sheets examined for this study. The creases formed as a result of sheet expansion and manipulation as the artist wetted the papers and perhaps brush applied a dilute, water-soluble adhesive (possibly starch-based) onto the sheets to adhere them to each other. In this laminate, there is barely any adhesion between the two paper layers, and it is possible that Gauguin relied upon the pressure he exerted upon the sheets before or during printing rather than on an adhesive to assure adhesion. The fine creases appear throughout but predominate vertically toward the center.\n\nOn the verso of the print, fiber disruption and brush marks resulting from the lamination process are readily visible (fig. 54.2.1). Where Gauguin applied pressure to the papers with a coarse brush to assure adhesion between them, he pulled and distorted the long Japanese-paper fibers. Likewise, the artist must have exerted a great deal of pressure with his brush during printing. This has resulted in a pronounced pattern of fiber disruption and lifting through the center of the composition running in the horizontal direction on the recto. Also, in areas where the paper fibers are skinned, it is likely that the paper was not as damp as it should have been when it was positioned on the wood block. As a result, the paper selectively stuck to the block. When Gauguin lifted the sheet from the block, some paper fibers remained adhered to it.\n\nThe minimal adhesion between the paper layers presented the opportunity to gently separate them for further study. This allowed fabrication characteristics of both papers to be more accurately identified in transmitted light. With the verso of the primary support accessible, the lack of any fiber disruption is striking, as is the way heavily applied watercolor passages have partially bled through to the verso. These passages, protected from light exposure, remain unfaded (fig. 54.2.5).\n\nThe chain line interval found in the laid paper bottom sheet runs vertically and is 35 mm wide, with one irregular interval of 32 mm on the right side of the sheet. The Art Institute collection includes two more hand-colored impressions created on laminated sheets, Maruru (cat. 55.2) and Te po (cat. 52.1). In L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 and Maruru, the laid paper is pasted beneath the wove paper, while in Te po the opposite is true, yet the overall visual effect remains the same in all cases. The chain line intervals in Maruru and Te po are identical to those in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9\u2014all are 35 mm wide with the exception of one in the center or on the right side of the sheet, which is 32 mm wide. Visually, the weight, color, and surface texture of the sheets are nearly identical. However, in Te po, the wove paper used as the underlying sheet is of a lighter weight and tone than the wove paper used in the other impressions.\n\n204 \u00d7 354 mm (image); 206 \u00d7 356 mm (sheets)\n\nIn this impression Gauguin made use of a frisket to selectively ink and manipulate the roller to deposit varying amounts of ink on the block. Brown ink, applied first, appears only in the bottom half of the print, indicating that the artist wiped it away from the top half of the block. Whether this ink layer was residue from a previous printing or unique to this printing is difficult to ascertain, although we do know that Gauguin would quite often reprint blocks with ink residue on them (see, for example, cat. 53.3).\n\nHere the brown ink follows the contours of the matrix. To protect the brown ink layer, a frisket was used to cover it while Gauguin rolled a layer of black ink onto the top half of the block. The black ink layer is ever so slightly askew from the brown when examined under magnification. Evidence of the hard line of the frisket is visible at the center left and center right edges where the transition occurs. It would not be unusual for Gauguin to use a frisket in printing the block. The technique bears great similarity to the use of a stencil and was a straightforward way for the artist to isolate a broad swath of the composition.\n\nAfter he printed the brown and black inks, the frisket was removed, and Gauguin rolled another layer of black ink onto the block. Here his virtuosity as a printer is evident, as he varied the pressure he applied to the roller. To deposit a thin layer of ink onto the bottom half of the block and a thicker layer onto the top half, he exerted less pressure on the lower end of the roller than on the upper end. Under magnification this is readily apparent. Once inked to his satisfaction, Gauguin wiped ink very selectively from the block in and around the figure on the left and to ease the transition from black to brown through the center of the composition (fig. 54.2.6).\n\nIt appears that when at last Gauguin placed a sheet of paper on the inked block to print it, the paper was no longer as damp as it should have been, and the inks had dried out slightly as well. This resulted in selective adhesion of paper fibers to the block. In removing the sheet from the block, Gauguin abraded the paper fibers, leaving, for example, large areas of white paper visible below the waves at left (fig. 54.2.7). In other areas where Gauguin brushed the paper from left to right to set the disrupted fibers back down, fine crescent-shaped areas of pulled paper fibers are visible through the center of the composition (fig. 54.2.8). In a final nod to Gauguin\u2019s hands-on approach to printing his block, a large fingerprint appears in the lower right where black and brown inks intersect to the right of the artist\u2019s monogram. On the verso there are two black fingerprints along the left and right edges of the sheet\u2014perhaps one set transferred when the paper was put down on the block and another transferred when the paper was lifted from the block. Seemingly undeterred, and perhaps quite delighted with the random outcome of his printing of the block, Gauguin washed watercolors over the printed impression.\n\nGauguin\u2019s choice of a fibrous ivory-toned Japanese paper to print this impression of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 was quite intentional; he knew that the fibrous paper was absorbent and would readily accept the watercolor medium. Against the light paper tone the colors would have appeared quite vibrant. Over time, with exposure to light, the watercolor passages on the front of the print have faded significantly. The vibrancy of the colors selected by the artist is still evident on the verso where the watercolor remains less faded in some areas and totally unfaded in others (see fig. 54.2.2).\n\nThe hand-colored print was conserved in anticipation of this publication. When discoloration was removed from the sheet, its tone brightened significantly, and the colors now appear more vibrant. Comparison with watercolor passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape [Women at the River] [cat. 59.2]), and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with an ivory hue rather than a golden tone (fig. 54.2.9 and fig. 54.2.10).\n\nOverall, this print bears the hallmarks of a sheet that was kept close at hand by the artist. There are stray marks of white pigment on the surface, especially along the right edge at center and below the central fish. There are also splotches and drips of a translucent material that appears to be wax.\n\nThe thin, supple, laminated sheet displayed significant undulation, especially vertically through the center. The undulations were more concentrated on the right side of the sheetthan on the left. It is likely that the sheet was rubbed from left to right in the printing process, with the block and paper oriented vertically. There are several pronounced creases that appear to have formed during printing. These include three strong irregular vertical creases the run from the top to the bottom of the sheet through the center, approximately 145 mm, 168 mm, and 180 mm in from the left edge. The remaining fine vertical creases throughout are a result of sheet expansion and manipulation during the lamination process. Additionally, the sheet has residual adhesive on the edges from a previous mount that may also have contributed to the creasing.\n\nDirectly to the right of the central figure there is a small passage of white that corresponds to a very deliberate gouge in the block, the purpose of which is unclear. It is visible in the second-state impression cited above, which indicates that the gouge was added early on in the development of the block.\n\nIn the lower right there are two small losses and four abrasions that do not penetrate through to the verso. The hard-edged sharpness of these losses may indicate that glass once broke on the surface of the print. There is a small printing flaw in the upper right, 23 mm down from the upper right corner. The sheet was foxed throughout with golden-yellow fox spots. On the recto the foxing is mostly obscured in normal light, although it is faintly visible in the lower right quadrant, in the waves and below them, and along the top at center. Under ultraviolet light, the spots fluoresce golden yellow. In raking light the numerous creases and undulations are visible. The appearance of disrupted fibers in both the top and bottom sheets is enhanced in raking light.  \nHarriet K.

This brings the total number of states to three.\n\nThe locations of eight blocks from the Noa Noa Suite are known. Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF, macro-XRF, Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTime and time again the silvery medium appears in Gauguin\u2019s hand-colored impressions from the Noa Noa Suite. And in each instance where the same medium is visible on the verso it is an intense black tone (see also Te po [The Night] [cat. 52.1] and Nave nave fenua [Delightful Land] [cat. 56.1]). Identification by means of XRF and Raman microspectroscopy proved inconclusive.

This may indicate that the blue pigment was mixed with zinc white to obtain a lighter tone.\n\nGiven that the two paper layers separate so easily, it is possible that the artist did not use any adhesive at all. Instead he could have taken the two sheets, dampened them, and simply pounded and pressed them together to achieve adhesion between them. The long Japanese paper fibers would have responded readily to this manner of adhesion.\n\nIn the upper left corner of the print, the two papers are solidly adhered to each other and cannot be separated. Possibly in the past the sheets were separated and readhered with a modern adhesive. The area of readhesion on the verso takes the form of a triangle with flattened paper fibers and a noticeable crease.\n\nNote that papers formed on traditional paper molds of Eastern origin often do not display pronounced laid line patterns from which frequencies can be readily measured, as is the case here.\n\nMary Broadway, conservation report and treatment record, Mar. 2015; Harriet K.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

This print is inscribed with the number 9, the ninth print in the \u201cGravures sur bois\u201d section of the exhibition, which corresponds to entry no. 144, \u201cL\u2019Univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9.\u201d\n\nThere are two editions of this exhibition catalogue.
