    "description": "<p><strong>This program has been cancelled. </strong></p><p>Dara Birnbaum (born 1946) emerged as a pioneer of video art in the mid-1970s, when many women artists challenged the gender biases of mass media and popular culture. Early on she disrupted and deconstructed the language of television, revealing embedded stereotypes and expectations. For four decades Birnbaum has remained highly active in media arts internationally, exhibiting provocative single-channel and installation works at major institutions, on screen, and in public spaces. Her works are among the most influential and innovative contributions to the contemporary discourse on art and television.</p><p>Presented by the <a href=\"https://scaaic.org/\">Society for Contemporary Art</a></p>",
