    "description": "<p>Join Kristen French, Tours Specialist in Gallery Activation, for a discussion of the exhibition&nbsp;<a href=\"/exhibitions/9713/salvador-dali-the-image-disappears\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" draggable=\"false\"><em>Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears</em></a><em> </em>and a look at how the artist has become a household name in the United States.</p><p>Bringing together more than 30 paintings, drawings, photos, and surrealist objects, as well as a rich selection of printed matter, books, and artists ephemera to explore this critical period, the exhibition considers Dal\u00ed\u2019s work in light of two defining, if contradictory, impulses: an immense desire for visibility and the urge to disappear.</p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p><strong>Kristen French</strong> is the Tours Specialist in Gallery&nbsp;Activation, Interpretation. At the museum, she is part of a team that produces public programs for adults as well as multi-generational audiences, and facilitates gallery talks and conversations.
