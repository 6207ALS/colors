Characteristic of the artist\u2019s earliest output, this type of drawing allowed him to experiment with pose, technique, and expression. Throughout the early and mid-1850s, Whistler made numerous pencil and pen drawings of soldiers and other figures, sometimes incorporating titles and other narrative text. Military figures also comprise the subject of his first published work; a lithograph based on one of his drawings was used to illustrate the cover for a piece of sheet music, \u201cSong of the Graduates,\u201d while he was a student at West Point Military Academy (fig. 1\u20135.1).\n\nThe five Art Institute sketches are products of the brief period when Whistler served as a draftsman for the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey office in Washington, DC, from November 1854 to February 1855, although in style they also resemble earlier works done while he was a cadet at West Point (1851\u201354). John Ross Key, the drawings\u2019 first owner and Whistler\u2019s friend in the Coast Survey, wrote in 1908 that the artist \u201cwas preoccupied in those days with producing the soldiers and heads of his fancy, and when he had completed a bit that pleased him, he signed it with the initials J. W.\u201d Two of the Art Institute drawings, Gendarme (cat. 3) and Lancer (cat. 4), include this early style of signature.\n\nThe drawings are lively and spontaneous in feel and were likely quick, improvisational sketches rather than studies for larger compositions. Indeed, Key later recalled that at the time, \u201cevery drawing board, sheet or bit of paper that he [Whistler] could find he embellished with heads and figures.\u201d Hussar (cat. 5) unites both of these early pictorial interests; in addition to the figure depicted on the sheet\u2019s recto, two light and unfinished drawings in graphite appear on the verso, one of a man wearing a top hat and another of a head wrapped in a bandage (fig. 1\u20135.2). Some figures from the group, such as the Hussar and the Gendarme (cat. 3), are described in detail, while others, among them the Policeman and Citizen (cat. 2) are more suggestion than substance. In each case, Whistler relied heavily on loose crosshatching to convey texture and shadow. His early graphic style reflects the types of caricatures and illustrations that appeared in abundance in such nineteenth-century periodicals as Punch and Le Charivari; scholars often cite the French artist and illustrator Paul Gavarni, in particular, as an early inspiration for Whistler (fig. 1\u20135.3).\n\nThough Whistler\u2019s technique would change significantly in later years, certain features of his early drawings anticipate later approaches. The highly energetic, irregular scribble that predominates in these compositions would continue to be a defining feature of the artist\u2019s graphic style, and a burgeoning interest in tonality is evinced by his combined use of pencil and pen to bring out a wider range of gray and black shades. When the drawings were reproduced in the Chicago Times-Herald (see fig. 1\u20135.4), the author of the corresponding article remarked of the Hussar in particular, \u201cNote the graceful pose, and the flowing lines . . . and you will observe that he has ever been a student of the combination of definite lines, and of picturesque juxtapositions of shadow and light.\u201d The drawings also bespeak an early interest in costume; the careful attention to the detail of the soldiers\u2019 uniforms typifies the painstaking emphasis Whistler would later place on dress in his portraiture.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Soldier with Lance corresponds to Margaret F.

MacDonald, James McNeill Whistler: Drawings, Pastels, and Watercolours; A Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1995), hereafter MacDonald (1995), 33 (cat. 108). However, the design of the cover bears a distinct resemblance to another early drawing, West Point Cadets (1852/54; [MacDonald (1995), 32\u201333 (cat. 106r)]). Katharine Lochnan posits that this drawing was actually the basis for the sheet-music cover; see Katharine Lochnan, \u201c1852\u20131855: First Lithographs,\u201d in The Lithographs of James McNeill Whistler, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Martha Tedeschi (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1998), 1:32. In either case, it is likely that Whistler\u2019s original drawing was greatly altered in the translation from drawing to lithograph, as Lochnan notes.\n\nThe dating of the five drawings to Whistler\u2019s time in the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey office is firmly established in \u201cWhistler\u2019s First Plate Found: Most Important of Recent Discoveries in the Art World,\u201d Chicago Times-Herald, Mar. 8, 1896, 30, where all five of the drawings are reproduced (see fig. 3): \u201cThe fortunate owner of Whistler\u2019s coast survey plate [John Ross Key, Whistler\u2019s friend in the Coast Survey] also possesses five fascinating pen and ink drawings, which illustrate this article, from the great master\u2019s hand, made during the months he was in the employ of the United States government.\u201d Key also noted that Whistler made the drawings during his time in the Coast Survey in a letter to Charles Lang Freer; see John Ross Key to Charles Lang Freer, Feb. 15, 1896, repr. in University of Glasgow, The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed.
