    "description": "<p>Vaginal Davis is a key figure in the history of queer music, performance, and video art. Naming herself after the activist Angela Davis, she emerged in the queer and punk club performance scene of Los Angeles in the late 1970s. The artist created her own mythology during the live performances of her \u201cmultiracial, maxi-gendered\u201d bands\u2014an interplay between identify, fiction, and critique that also informs her influential xeroxed print publications, or zines, and later video work. Davis is a founding figure in the \u201chomocore\u201d movement that reinterpreted hardcore punk through queer cultures, as well as the art and music networks of the 1990s that influenced the emergence of the feminist punk Riot Grrrl movement.</p><p>Presented by the Society for Contemporary Art</p>",
