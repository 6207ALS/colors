Their procession continues across and below to folios 7C/D and 8A/B. The top-hatted men are transformed into strutting birds similar to J. J. Grandville\u2019s illustrations in Sc\u00e8nes de la vie priv\u00e9e et publique des animaux (Scenes from the Private and Public Life of Animals; see fig. 1) and Les m\u00e9tamorphoses du jour (The Metamorphoses of the Day; see fig. 2). Signs in their hats refer to food: the words for petits fours, green beans, and prunes are all legible. Their ranks include a man with the red-circled eye and sharp beak of a chicken. Others have blotched skin and weak chins, possible indicators of disease and degeneracy. They follow the man at lower right, whose face extends into folio 7C/D and whose rooster body appears in folio 8A/B. The band on his hat (visible at far right) proclaims VIVE LE SAINT L\u2019ORGUEIL. . . (Long live Saint Pride). The last three letters, TUE, seem to belong to another, illegible, word.\n\nAbove this group on the right looms a grinning monster whose head explodes, perhaps from a nearby bomb. He may be wearing a restraining garment\u2014a possible reference to Ensor\u2019s father\u2019s mental troubles. The XX on the left side of the garment may allude to the artists\u2019 collective Les XX (Les Vingt, 1883\u201393) and Ensor\u2019s ongoing struggles with the group (see \u201cThe Trials of \u2018The Temptation\u2019\u201d). Behind and next to this monster is a large, balloon-like creature whose open mouth, seen in profile, reveals sharp teeth, broad lips, and a tongue; it extends into sheet 6A.\n\nOn the left side of the sheet, two legs with bright-red shoes hang down. Originally, they may have belonged to a religious figure whose upper body no longer exists. Historical restorations are preserved at the top left edge and along the right edge, and the sites of removed artist\u2019s patches appear as lighter areas of paper. The patches once masked an area in the upper left corner and the red shoes at center left, possibly to obscure any religious reference. SMC/KJN\n\nBrass bands, processions, the Ostend carnival, and strikes were part of everyday life for Ensor, and the artist developed a particular interest in the behavior of groups and crowds. When visiting Brussels, he would often stay with the Rousseau family at 20, rue Vautier, or in the area around Boulevard Anspach (one of Brussels\u2019s main arteries in the late nineteenth century), where he would watch the city\u2019s bourgeoisie file past as they ran errands. Interested in social justice, Ensor liked to ridicule the ruling classes, as he does here with the bourgeois figures wearing top hats. The parade is reminiscent of the crowd on Boulevard Anspach, as shown in the related print, House on Boulevard Anspach (fig. 3). It also recalls Ensor\u2019s other crowd compositions, such as The Cathedral (fig. 4) and The Entry of Christ into Brussels (fig. 5), in which the artist scrutinized and judged the behavior of politicians, the military, the church, the bourgeoisie, and Belgians at large.
