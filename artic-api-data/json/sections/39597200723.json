Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as in this third\u2014and final\u2014state impression of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude). The group spans the entire Noa Noa Suite, with representative impressions printed with the same combination of materials and techniques from each of the ten blocks. After satisfactorily arriving at final compositions on the blocks, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color using oil-based media, some that contained beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 55.4.2).\n\nFour different layers of media are present in this print. Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from a piece of glass. The printing ink used for this layer has a fluid appearance, and was applied evenly over much of the block. Oil-based media containing some beeswax was then transferred on top of it. Chrome yellow, vermilion, emerald green, and orange (a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow or chrome orange) were applied to specific areas by means of transfer from the glass (see fig. 55.4.3 and fig. 55.4.4). Atop these two layers of colored media, the block was printed twice, first in an iron oxide\u2013containing printing ink that is likely deep yellow ocher, then in carbon black printing ink that contains some Prussian blue.\n\nThe good-quality, medium-weight Japanese paper is well sized with a slight sheen overall that is visible in raking light. Long paper fibers are visible under magnification and in transmitted light an irregular shu (mold) impression can be seen. The left edge is deckled. The right and bottom edges are irregularly hand torn, although at first glance they appear to be deckled as well. The top of the sheet has a hard straight-cut edge. There is a significant amount of paper remaining around the printed image. The sheet has a slightly warm gray cast due to discoloration and embedded surface dirt. It is identical to the paper used to print an impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56.3). In both impressions the blocks were printed twice over a bright yellow tone block, and additional media were added by means of transfer.\n\nFor the verso of this sheet, see fig. 55.4.1.\n\n206 \u00d7 357 mm (image); 235 \u00d7 394 mm (sheet)\n\nThis impression was printed in three layers. The first layer of media applied to the paper was bright chrome yellow, and it was applied overall by means of transfer from another source, traditionally called a tone block, used to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper, or another wood block; however, it is more likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. The use of a tone block is confirmed by the presence of yellow in the distant sky, in the tree behind the idol, and in the foreground forms; all have been applied site specifically to the paper. The second layer of transferred media is oil based and may contain some beeswax. It has a waxy consistency and its deposition is also loosely site specific. There are passages of emerald green in the tree (fig. 55.4.5), orange in the distant sky, background and idol, and yellow in the kapok seeds in the foreground. Using glass to transfer the media, the artist achieved site specificity. By placing the glass over the block he accurately located where he wanted to deposit media.\n\nOcher and black inks were printed successively over the transferred media. One printing is deliberately off register from the other by 1 mm in the horizontal direction. Much of the ocher printing that underlies the black is obscured by it. The black ink was rolled onto the block in two passes. Ink deposition in some areas is intensely black while in others it is uneven and spotty. Gauguin rolled the ink onto the block moving from right to left, lifting the roller prematurely as he approached the left edge, inadvertently creating a 10 mm vertical band of irregularly deposited ink (fig. 55.4.6). Elsewhere, thin areas of ink deposition appear in the background to the right of the palm tree and extend across the sheet to the idol\u2019s head and feet. In his final touches, the artist took a rag and deliberately wiped black ink from the block in these same areas (fig. 55.4.7).\n\nOnce printed, Gauguin reworked the impression with brush and black wash. Today this wash has a silvery appearance, perhaps due to fading of some component of the ink (fig. 55.4.8). He applied it with a dry brush in wispy curved strokes to cast into shadow the large lobe of the tree to the left of the idol (fig. 55.4.9), and he added emphatic lines to the three figures in the foreground. Examination of passages where black ink bled through to the verso reveals that the artist reworked all of the forms in the foreground to cast them further into darkness. In an unusual step in his process, Gauguin hand applied touches of yellow media, presumed to be thinned printing ink, with his finger, and where the black ink was not yet dry, he blended the yellow with it (fig. 55.4.10). Because the black ink passages read as silver, the yellow areas feature much more prominently than originally intended by the artist. It is likely that when Gauguin completed his work on this impression, he had established extreme contrasts of light and dark by thrusting the middle ground into darkness and illuminating the rest with yellow light emanating from over the distant mountains (fig. 55.4.11). Whether this change was intended or a way to repair an unintended printing flaw along the left side of the sheet is not known.\n\nIn anticipation of exhibition in 2002, the print underwent conservation treatment. Surface dirt, old hinges, paper tapes, and adhesive residues were removed.\n\nThe print is in good condition. There are vertical printing creases approximately 30 mm long along the right edge of the image and two longer creases 90 mm long in the center of the sheet. All edges have darkened slightly, and the margins have grayed with embedded surface dirt. Intermittent foxing is visible in the margins and on the verso of the sheet.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThis method of transfer is clearly the precursor to the watercolor and oil transfer methods that Gauguin adopted moving forward (see, for example, cat. 68 and cat. 124).
