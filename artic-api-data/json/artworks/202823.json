    "description": "<p>In 1956 Gorham Manufacturing Company, the country\u2019s leading maker and retailer of fashionable silver, recruited Donald Colflesh to bring a \u201ccontemporary dimension\u201d to its traditional products. Colflesh\u2019s most popular and successful design for the firm was the <em>Circa \u201970</em> series, in which he brilliantly captured America\u2019s ambition to go the moon. In this coffee service, the intersecting angles epitomize the era of space-age design, and the curving, upright thrust of the handles and spouts conveys the aerodynamics of the jet age. Gorham reinforced the coffee service\u2019s space-age associations in accompanying pamphlets, noting its \u201cfeeling of vertical motion . . . the upward look to space.\u201d The company\u2019s name for the line, <em>Circa \u201970</em>, also confidently alludes to the future and its possibilities. The sleek contours and elongated ebony finials and handles, however, were exceptional for mid-century hollowware and recall similar embellishments on early-20th-century Scandinavian silver.</p>\n",
