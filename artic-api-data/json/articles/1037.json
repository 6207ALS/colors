    "copy": " The everyday experiences of being sexually objectified collect in a woman\u2019s psyche over time. She becomes so accustomed to being looked at by others, so used to having her physical appearance under constant scrutiny, that she eventually turns that gaze inward. Day in and day out, she must ask herself: Am I thin enough? Am I curvy enough? Am I pretty enough? Am I anything if I am not beautiful? Men see her as nothing more than a body. She begins to see herself that way.   Here\u2019s what decades of psychological theory and research tell us. That shift\u2014from being surveyed to being the surveyor\u2014changes everything. It opens the door to an unrelenting stream of appearance anxieties. It alienates you from yourself and invites depression to take root. It transforms eating from a source of nourishment and pleasure to a battlefield where no one wins. When I wander the hushed hallways of the Art Institute of Chicago, I find no shortage of women frozen forever under the gaze of the men who painted them. Some of these women are named; some are anonymous. Some never existed at all, having been produced whole cloth from the fantasies of the men who brought them to life on canvas. Some of these women sit at a vanity like Ivan Albright\u2019s Ida , looking at themselves while we look at them.   Some, like John Singer Sargent\u2019s Mrs. George Swinton , return our stare. Shoulders back, chest forward, neck long, sucking in their abdomens to assist their stifling corsets, shaping themselves into something appealing, something worthy.   Today, women who want to be objects of visual pleasure don\u2019t need to capture the attention of a man who can wield a paintbrush. They can do it on their own with a smartphone. They capture themselves. They click. They post. They monitor the gaze of others in real time. But the game and its rules have changed little since Elizabeth Swinton posed for Sargent in the waning years of the 19th century. When a man paints a woman, it is art and it is beautiful. When a woman poses for and posts a photo of herself, it is greeted with a mixture of greed and disgust. The audience says, \u201cGive me more, but never make me admit I want it.\u201d The online commenters have a message for this woman:   Imagine if Jozsef Rippl-Ronai\u2019s Slender Woman with Vase posted this image on Instagram.   \u201cMy waist trainer is really working!\u201d she says. #littleblackdress. She creates a paid post for a company that peddles appetite suppressant lollipops to teenage girls. #youtoocanlooklikethis #finallyfits. Her commenters say, \u201cSo jealous!\u201d They say, \u201cHot!\u201d A colleague comments, \u201cMake it stop. #downwithdietculture.\u201d Ten minutes after she posts, a man she doesn\u2019t know writes, \u201c#butterface.\u201d Slender Woman googles butterface. She deletes the post. Jules Joseph Lefebvre\u2019s Odalisque posts on a Friday evening. #bodypositive #loveyourcurves.   \u201cJust a quiet Friday night,\u201d she says. The first few comments are nothing but \"slay.\" Sometime overnight, a man with whom she went on one date writes, \u201cShould have stayed in the drafts.\u201d A woman she went to high school with comments, \u201cTotally photoshopped waist. You edited the hell out of that pic.\u201d (It was. She did.) Next time she\u2019ll make it less obvious so no one will know. (They\u2019ll still know.)   If the feeds of Instagram are the halls of infinite art museums, the patrons are awful. They want their art for free. They want to hate it and love it at the same time. They want you to love them back when they love you and love them even more when they tell you how ugly you are. They want you to beg for their adoration while wallowing in shame for needing it. They comment #pickme when they think you\u2019re trying too hard to look good. They comment #tryagain when they think you\u2019re not trying hard enough.   They don\u2019t want you to be human. They want you to be the women on the gallery walls. Always inviting the gaze, impervious to the onslaught of criticism, blind to the hypocrisy that drives it. They want you to be an object. The psychological cost does not concern them. Maybe you\u2019re no longer sure if it concerns you. \u2014Renee Engeln, professor of instruction, Department of Psychology, Northwestern University, with hashtags by members of Northwestern's Body and Media Lab   Outside Voices articles feature creative thinkers and makers from Chicago and the Midwest\u2019s rich cultural community engaging with artwork in the collection.
