    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: 200 years ago, the owners of this dressing table would have valued it for being both beautiful and practical. With drawers in various sizes, and a cabinet tucked underneath where they could have kept a wig stand. A visitor would have noticed the expensive use of mahogany, especially in the deeply curved front drawers, where so much wood was carved away. To historians, it's also valuable because of who made it.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS:  It's not actually signed, there's no label left, which is typical of much 18th century furniture.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS:  In this case though, because of construction details, and actually also details of the motifs on the front, you can tell that it is by John Townsend, who was one of the leading furniture manufacturers in Newport in the late 18th century. In particular, you see the three shell forms across the front, carved in this very bold way. But in the center of each shell is a basket, which is made with crosshatches and petals. And those are motifs that are found really only in Townsend's late work, so that's partly how we can tell that it's by him.</p>\n",
