    "description": "<p>Join renowned architect Michael Maltzan and Maurice Cox, Chicago\u2019s Commissioner of the Department of Planning and Development (DPD), as they discuss the civic capacity of architecture and design in urban contexts. This conversation is moderated by Irene Sunwoo, John H. Bryan Chair and Curator of Architecture and Design.&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-be2f7443-7fff-28fd-f9e8-0e2d25ddbbb2\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br><br></span>Michael Maltzan is interested in architecture\u2019s ability to expand the context, types, and forms of its work. Within the complex social, political, and physical contexts of contemporary cities, he has come to believe that architecture possesses a broad range of capacities that allow it to impact not only a building being made, but also the field itself.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-be2f7443-7fff-28fd-f9e8-0e2d25ddbbb2\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br><br></span>Celebrated for his experience merging architecture, design and politics through public, private and elected positions, Commissioner Maurice Cox leads DPD's economic development, planning and zoning projects. He also fosters community-improvement initiatives across Chicago, especially in under-invested neighborhoods in the South and West sides. </p><p><em>Presented by the Butler-VanderLinden Lecture on Architecture.</em></p><h2><strong>About the Speaker</strong></h2><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
