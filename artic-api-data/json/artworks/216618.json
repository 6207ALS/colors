    "description": "<p>Conor &amp; David, an Irish graphic design studio, developed<br>this poster for Curate and Design\u2019s exhibition Less But Better: The Design Ethos of Dieter Rams. The poster ET 66: 5,537 depicts one of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams\u2019s most iconic products, which embodies his simple aesthetic and functional approach: the ET 66 calculator. One of the most notable design elements in the calculator is the replacement of the once-standard sliding on/off switch with circular, colored buttons. Conor &amp; David emphasized this innovation in their illustration of the calculator by depicting only three colored buttons within a black form, thus distilling the design and highlighting the primary characteristics of the iconic object. This approach echoes Rams\u2019s own notion that good design incorporates as little design as possible, a message reinforced by the number that appears in the LCD display of the calculator in the illustration: 5,537, which when viewed upside down spells the word \u201cless.\u201d</p>\n",
