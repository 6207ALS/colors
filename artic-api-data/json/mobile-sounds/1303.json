    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  No fashionable 18th Century dining table was without its elegant decorations.  At the highest level of society, these consisted of silver or porcelain or a combination of the two.  A formal dinner of three courses culminated in a spectacular array of sweet meats, often dramatically arranged around special decorations.  These monkey musicians made at the Meissen Porcelain Factor in Germany were dessert ornaments designed to delight the eye as the elaborate sweet meats pleased the palate.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: So imagine the dessert course of a dinner with this wonderful silver gilt and mirrored plateau and the porcelain figures laid out on the top of them with candlelight flickering and animating the figures as well as reflecting on the mirrored surface.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: Now why monkeys dressed as orchestra players?  It was a fashion in France in the early 18th Century for painted rooms and painted paddles with the monkey playing and sometimes dressed in European costume.<br>Narrator:  These musicians literally ape human activities but despite their fashionable and gentile attire, the monkeys show their hairy legs and sharp teeth with a little too much abandon.  Free from the human obligations of decorous behavior, the monkeys are at liberty to amuse and entertain the dinner guests, whose dessert course they decorated.</p>\n",
