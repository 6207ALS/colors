It shows a typical Renaissance subject\u2014the Annunciation, when the archangel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would bear the son of God\u2014and is executed in a technique common in Germany in the early 16th century. However, recent analysis has proven that this work is a forgery. An unknown draftsperson drew the composition on a sheet of old German paper datable to around 1500 but employed a blue pigment that was invented only in 1709. Created with the intent to deceive, the drawing passed through the art market and several private collections as an authentic 16th-century work.</p>\n",
