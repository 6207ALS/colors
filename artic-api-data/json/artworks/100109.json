    "description": "<p>Robert MacPherson moved to Rome in 1840, working as a landscape painter and art dealer until he began practicing photography in 1851. A new class of tourists\u2014beyond the coterie of aristocrats who had initially popularized the Grand Tour\u2014had begun traveling to Italy, and MacPherson quickly opened a photography studio to sell his high-quality prints of famous sculptures and architectural sites. For this view, he aimed his camera toward the southeast from the ruins of the Palace of the Caesars on Palatine Hill in Rome. Visible to the right are the Circus Maximus and the crenellated tower of the Santa Balbina church and monastery. In 1863 MacPherson wrote, \u201cI remain a photographer to this day, without any feeling that by doing so I have . . . forfeited my claim to the title of artist.\u201d</p>\n",
