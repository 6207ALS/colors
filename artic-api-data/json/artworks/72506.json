This image of a humble porch was included in the latter work, alongside photographs of residents, industry, vernacular architecture, and rolling landscapes to form a portrait of the state at 100. He wrote that he had \u201ctried to show the land and its people and their work . . . to give a lively and an honest sense of what the place is really like.\u201d Szarkowski\u2019s unvarnished depiction of a home that is aging, yet preserved with dignity, hints at the character of its inhabitants.</p>\n",
