    "description": "<p>This large and impressive drawing depicts the election of Oddone Colonna as Pope Martin V in 1417, an event that ended the Western Schism in the Catholic Church, when multiple parties claimed the title of pope. A highly finished study for a painting installed on a ceiling in the Palazzo Colonna in Rome, it depicts Colonna receiving the keys of Saint Peter from a kneeling figure while allegorical figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity, among others, look on.</p>\n<p>Highly theatrical and emotionally expressive, the drawing epitomizes late Baroque virtuoso design and draftsmanship.</p>\n",
