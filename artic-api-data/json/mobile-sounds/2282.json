    "transcript": "<p>ORIANNA CACCHIONE: Throughout the 1980s, there was an emergent pro-democracy movement in China. This really came to a head in 1989, when students began protesting in Tian\u2019anmen square. On June 4th, 1989, the Chinese government violently suppressed these protests to establish order and to also reestablish their authority in China.</p>\n<p>ZHANG PEILI: We suddenly realized that we as artists and intellectuals thought we were powerful but were in fact very small; we couldn\u2019t change life.</p>\n<p>ORIANNA CACCHIONE: At this moment, Zhang Peili starts making a series of paintings that reference Pop Culture. So he makes a painting appropriating pop culture from the National News Broadcasts. Document on Hygiene, where he\u2019s washing a chicken for three hours, is really different. It stands out against this painterly practice that he has at the moment.</p>\n<p>ZHANG PEILI: There are three reasons why I wanted to wash a chicken. First, chicken don\u2019t use water when they wash themselves; they use sand and dirt. Secondly, at the time I lived in a community where there were a lot of \u201chygiene campaigns\u201d. When a hygiene campaign was initiated, there would be new \u201cdocuments\u201d and people working for the community would come to your apartment patrolling your domestic hygiene. To me, these sorts of hygiene campaigns had less to do with hygiene but more to do with the intention to control...Lastly, I was very inspired by a tale from Daoist philosophy.</p>\n<p>ORIANNA CACCHIONE: There is a Daoist story about Zhuangzi, the Daoist master, walking with his student by a river and the student looks down and he looks at the fish and he asks Zhuangzi if he thinks the fish are happy and Zhuangzi\u2019s response is \u201chow can we know?\u201d So it becomes this question provoking how we know someone else\u2019s consciousness.</p>\n<p>ZHANG PEILI:  What the work  implies is that we, as humans, assume that chicken do not use water to wash themselves. However, that\u2019s just our human\u2019s perspective. If we use water to wash the chicken, we don\u2019t actually know whether the chicken would be content or not! It may be happy about it; it may be not. So, I used this as a metaphor to imply the difficulty between interpersonal communication.</p>\n",
