    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This scene from classical mythology shows Apollo, god of music and of the sun standing in a grove of cypress trees. His muscular body is bathed in the sun\u2019s golden light, and he holds his lyre at his side. Nearby stands the satyr, Marsyas. Apollo had challenged him to a musical contest angered by the Satyr\u2019s pride in his flute playing. The story has a dark ending where the muses judge Apollo the winner, and Marsyas is flayed alive. The painting was made by the German artist Hans Thoma. It may seem strange that such a classical, seemingly traditional image was made in 1888. By then, French realists and impressionist paintings of modern life and radical new techniques had transformed the way art was made, and their influence had spread throughout Europe. Thoma and his circle wished to find a way to move beyond these new artistic conventions. To do so they drew on Greek and Roman mythology, and Germanic legends for subject matter. Thoma also looked for stylistic inspiration to the classicizing paintings of the preeminent French artist Purvis de Chavannes, whose work you can see in this gallery.</p>\n",
