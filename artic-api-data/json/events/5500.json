She discusses the process of cultural transmission and adaptation that occurred in East Asian countries and the ceremonial significance of large-scale folding screens in Joseon court art. Through comparisons of various versions of <em>Banquet of Guo Ziyi</em>, she presents insights into Joseon court painting style and its broader cultural influence.</p><p><em>This program is generously funded by the National&nbsp;Museum of Korea.</em></p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p>Yoonjug Seo is an assistant professor in the Department of Art History, Myongji University, Seoul.
