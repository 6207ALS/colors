She appears to be almost asleep, a newspaper or magazine abandoned on her lap. Beatrix\u2019s lassitude, recorded in several lithographs drawn in August and September 1894, may signal the onset of her fatal illness, diagnosed as cancer at the end of the year. Nevertheless, the theme of the recumbent female, posed casually either on a chair, a sofa, or in bed, was a recurrent one in Whistler\u2019s work, from early drawings of Helen Ionides (M 336\u201338), drawings and etchings of Joanna Hiffernan (M 309, 310; K 92), and images of Maud Franklin in a variety of media (M 866, 867, 901\u201303; YMSM 254), to the late, intimate lithographs of Beatrix and members of her family (cat. 107, cat. 108, cat. 109, cat. 159, cat. 160, and cat. 175).\n\nBefore starting to draw this image, Whistler tried out his crayons\u2014both pointed and blunt\u2014on the right and left sides of the sheet of transfer paper. These small marks were allowed to remain on the stone after the image was transferred and apparently troubled neither the artist nor his printers. Close examination of impressions of the lithograph reveals evidence of an irregular texture in the surface of the transfer drawing. This can probably be attributed to uneven brush marks left on the papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal when its surface was coated with gum at Lemercier\u2019s shop, where Whistler had recently been reintroduced to the transparent transfer paper.\n\nAs he waited impatiently for the Ways to send him the first proofs of Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97), Whistler sent off \u201canother drawing\u201d on the same transfer paper with a letter dated 17 August 1894 (letter 106). This drawing must have been La Belle Dame paresseuse. The artist subsequently referred to the two images together in letters to his dealers and printers, expressing his enthusiasm for the effects he had achieved with the French paper. In a letter he sent to the Ways on September 14, for example, he explained: \u201cThe newest and most beautiful quality I have reached is in \u2018La Belle Dame Paresseuse.\u2019 . . . Take a fine proof of this and put it beside any one of the old lithographs out of your portfolio\u2014and then see how this \u2018belle dame\u2019 looks fair and silvery, and beautiful in the quality of blacks! Indeed far and away more like the charcoal drawing itself the painter\u2014than anything that had ever been printed!\u2014It is really also quite velvety\u2014like . . . the burr in a dry-point!\u2014Now even the little Rue de Furstenberg has also this same \u2018fusain\u2019 look\u2014and no other paper has ever given it!\u201d (letter 118).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove Japanese vellum (311 \u00d7 231 mm), signed.

By August 22, proofs of three new lithographs (cat. 98, cat. 99, and cat. 100) had been printed by the Ways in London and sent to Whistler in Paris. On that date the artist wrote to tell the printers how pleased he was with the latest impressions, describing this drawing as \u201cthe other seated lady\u201d to differentiate it from La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99); letter 109.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 98, only state.
