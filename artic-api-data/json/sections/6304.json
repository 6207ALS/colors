The procedure damaged his abdominal muscles, leaving him physically weak and unable to stand for long periods of time. Matisse would work for the next several years mostly from the confines of his bed (see fig. 48\u201349.1). The artist\u2019s output of drawings during this time was tremendous, and on April 3, 1942, he wrote to his son Pierre in New York, reporting that \u201cfor a year now I\u2019ve been making an enormous effort in drawing. I say effort, but that\u2019s a mistake, because what has occurred is a floraison [flowering] after fifty years of effort . . .\u201d\n\nThe two drawings titled Head of a Woman now in the Art Institute\u2019s collection date to this period of intense production. The one from 1941 depicts Janie Michels (see fig. 48\u201349.2), a Belgian artist who was visiting family in Nice in the summer of that year. Matisse presents her with her left hand raised as she pulls her wavy hair back from her face, causing her bracelet to fall down her arm. To create this image, the artist used long, fluid marks, which are enhanced by his choice of a dip pen. The simplicity of the lines is evident in her face: Michels\u2019s eyelids are formed with a few short dashes and her eyes accented with a scribbled mass of black ink. In contrast, Matisse added some detail to the floral motif that adorns her neckline, even reloading his pen with more ink in order to continue drawing when it dried out in the middle of making the flowers.\n\nMany of Matisse\u2019s sketches from 1941 and 1942, with their elegant, clean lines, became the series Themes and Variations, which was published by Martin Fabiani in 1943. The series contains seventeen theme drawings, each designated by a letter and with numbered variations. Matisse described the suite as a \u201cmotion picture film of the feelings of an artist. A suite of successive images resulting from the realization of a given theme on the part of the creator.\u201d\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s Head of a Woman from 1942 is related to group O from Themes and Variations (see fig. 48\u201349.3, fig. 48\u201349.4, fig. 48\u201349.5, fig. 48\u201349.6, and fig. 48\u201349.7). Here the artist\u2019s assistant, Lydia Delectorskaya, is shown wearing a ring, a watch, and a dress with puffy sleeves. Rather than focus on his model\u2019s face, Matisse depended on her accessories\u2014rendered in a simple line\u2014to serve as an anchor for the theme. When describing her experience posing for Themes and Variations and related drawings, Delectorskaya noted that the variations were drawn in a matter of hours, during which Matisse rarely looked at his model and worked in absolute silence. She referred to them as \u201cinspired drawings\u201d and said he was \u201clike a medium in a trance.\u201d The same is likely true of the Art Institute\u2019s related work, which comprises several continuous, firmly placed crayon lines, as if Matisse was quickly executing his image of Delectorskaya from memory. One long, continuous mark defines her chin, cheek, eyebrow, and nose. The lines are hurried and few and, again, only scribbled dots represent her eyes. Matisse drew her fingers as simple, curved lines, leaving them open and anatomically incomplete.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\nApr. 1952: Head of a Girl (Art Institute of Chicago, 1952 addendum to Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse, exh. cat.
