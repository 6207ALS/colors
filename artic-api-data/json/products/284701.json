    "description": "<p>This book features 31 objects from Constance R. Caplan's noted collection of 20th- and 21st-century art, including works in a variety of media by artists such as Hans Arp, Lydia Benglis, Liz Deschens, Claes Oldenberg, and Cy Twombly. Rather than specialize in one medium, artist, or movement, Caplan has instead assembled paintings, photographs, drawings, sculptures, and examples of decorative art that include voices from both the school and the museum of the Art Institute of Chicago.\u00a0 Yve-Alain Bois provides a historical overview of the collection's genesis, with a particular focus on the dialogue among works from different artistic disciplines. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hardcover: 160 pages with 72 color illustrations</p><p>8 1/4 x 10 x 1 in.</p>",
