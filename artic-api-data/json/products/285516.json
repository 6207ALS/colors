    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>The Oyster Dishy Gold Earrings are hand carved in wax and cast in recycled sterling silver, then plated in heavy 18K gold and finished with a high polished edge. Sarah Richardson&rsquo;s collection ranges from everyday simple to extraordinary. The organic nature of her jewelry finds balance and symmetry through replication. Each piece is finely crafted in California using traditional metalsmithing techniques in precious metals. </span></p><p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Size:&nbsp; 0.5 in.
