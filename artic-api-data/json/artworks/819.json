    "description": "<p>Horatio Greenough lived in Italy for most of his adult life and is recognized as the first American to pursue marble sculpting as a profession. This bust is one of two sculptures he produced depicting Abdiel, an angel from John Milton\u2019s epic poem <em>Paradise Lost</em>. With his finely chiseled features, pronounced profile, and elaborately carved Greek warrior\u2019s helmet, Abdiel resembles the Classical statue <em>Apollo Belvedere</em>. Through his production of idealist works such as <em>Abdiel</em> and his writings on aesthetics, Greenough sought to educate Americans about art and culture, and to inspire them to produce a national art that reflected democratic values.</p>\n",
