    "description": "<p>Rocks can\u2019t talk, but the Golden Rock of Burma certainly has a story to tell. For centuries, devotees have placed thin strips of gold leaf on the rock, celebrating the power of the relic buried deep inside of it, which keeps it from toppling over the edge of the cliff from its precarious perch. In this lecture by Donald Stadtner, the myth and legends surrounding the Golden Rock of Burma are illuminated.</p><p>Donald Stadtner was for many years associate professor at the University of Texas, Austin, after completely his PhD in Indian art at the University of California, Berkeley. He is presently preparing <em>Sacred Sites of Sri Lanka</em> for River Books.</p><p>This lecture is presented by the Asian Art Council.</p>",
