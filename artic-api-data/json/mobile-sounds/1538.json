    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This Pieta, or lamentation of the Virgin Mary over the dead Christ, is by the 17th century Italian sculptor Filippo Parodi. It is a wonderful example of Baroque art, whose dramatic forms aim to engage both the heart and mind of the viewer. Curator of European sculpture, Bruce Boucher.</p>\n<p>BRUCE BOUCHER: What we see is the body of Christ taken down from the cross, spent, dead, the signs of the Crucifixion are being held by the little puto [ph?] on the lower right. And above the body of Christ, his mother is weeping over him, you see tears in her eyes. The whole thing is taking art and raising it to a higher pitch, to a much more urgent style in which we are supposed to be moved. We feel with the Virgin, her sorrows, her sufferings. Also the way in which her drapery is agitated, and the drapery around the Christ seems to amplify the feeling of loss and desolation. All of that is really part of the way in which Baroque artists, particularly sculptors, would convey the inner turmoil of religious figures in a scene like this.</p>\n",
