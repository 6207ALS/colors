    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Deep in timeless meditation the goddess Saraswati sits on her lotus throne. Her multiple arms express her power. She is the goddess of learning. You can see a book in her lower left hand. In her upper right hand is an animal prod called a goad. That\u2019s a noose in her upper left hand. Both of these objects are used to train elephants. But they also have spiritual meanings. The goad symbolizes wisdom and the noose stands for mindfulness. Together, they remind the goddess\u2019s devotees of the discipline necessary to achieve spiritual progress. Take a look at the top of the sculpture just about Saraswati\u2019s crown. See if you can make out two bulging eyes above two stylized cheeks. That\u2019s the so called \u201cface of glory\u201d. It\u2019s an apotropaic image. That is, it\u2019s designed to keep away evil. This sculpture is from Karnataka, India, home of some of the oldest known Hindu temples. But the very ornate carving on this sculpture is typical of thirteenth century Jain temples. In fact, the wise Saraswati is revered by practitioners of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism, three of the world\u2019s oldest known belief systems.</p>\n",
