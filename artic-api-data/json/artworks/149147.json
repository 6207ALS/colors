Fewer than two thousand people occupied the half-million acres around the town. The Army took over the land and built the world\u2019s first large-scale nuclear reactor. Throughout the Cold War, Hanford produced much of the raw material for America\u2019s nuclear arsenal. \n\nMore than 440 billion gallons of chemical and radioactive waste were poured into the ground at Hanford, including enough plutonium to build two-dozen nuclear bombs. Airborne radiation was deliberately released to test the effects of iodine 131 on the surrounding area and its residents, who were not warned of dangers to their health.\n\nHanford\u2019s plutonium production facility was shut down in 1988. A massive clean-up effort is underway. \n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
