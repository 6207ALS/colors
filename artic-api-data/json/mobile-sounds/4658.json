    "transcript": "<p>This is Andrew, audio producer at the Art Institute, and I want to welcome you to the tour How to make a Surrealist Artwork. Now, it\u2019s possible you\u2019ve heard of Surrealism before or perhaps you know some of the artists that are considered Surrealists, like Salvador Dali. But what exactly makes something Surrealist? This is not an easy question answer, not even the Surrealists themselves could agree on it. Nonetheless, you and I, along with curator Caitlin Haskell and research associates Brian Leahy and Jennifer Cohen are  going to take on this difficult question and work together to make sense of this complex and fascinating movement.</p>\n<p>From disorienting landscapes tostrange, dream-like sculptures we\u2019ll delve into the artistic techniques and philosophies of some of the greatest artists of the 20th century.</p>\n<p>Like with all of our tours, we encourage you to take the stops in order; however, feel free to jump around uses the numbers listed on the label next to the artwork. We hope you enjoy the tour and thank you for listening.</p>\n",
