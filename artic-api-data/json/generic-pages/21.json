    "copy": " The Ryerson and Burnham Libraries constitute a major art and architecture research collection of more than 600,000 print titles, 100,000 auction catalogs, 200 current serial subscriptions, and extensive digital collections. All periods and media are covered, but special emphasis is placed on architecture of the 18th through 20th centuries and 19th-century painting, prints, drawings, and decorative arts. Special collections include the Percier and Fontaine Collection of 17th- to 19th-century architectural books; the Mary Reynolds Collection on Dada and Surrealism; the George R. Collins Archive of Catalan Art and Architecture; and the Mrs. James Ward Thorne Collection of illustrated books.   Online Catalog Explore the Online Catalog The libraries\u2019 online catalog is the primary discovery tool for our collections, containing records for our print and digital holdings, as well as the processed collections in the Art Institute of Chicago Archives. Art Institute staff and faculty at the School of the Art Institute may sign in to the catalog in order to access digital content and request print materials. All researchers may create lists of resources and print or email the catalog records to plan for a research appointment in the Reading Room. Once an appointment is approved, the researcher will be provided with credentials to sign in to the catalog and request materials. Learn more about research appointments here .   Databases Explore our Databases The libraries subscribe to a variety of databases, most of which are focused on art, architecture, and design. Most library databases are available to researchers within the Reading Room, though a small number of our resources are restricted to reference desk use. Art Institute staff and faculty and students at the School of the Art Institute may log in to the majority of the databases by entering the credentials they use to access their Art Institute email accounts.   Research Guides Explore our Research Guides Librarians have created online guides and bibliographies to assist you in your exploration of our collections. Learn how to research a work of art, uncover the history of a Chicago building, locate a professional appraiser, or find information on works exhibited at the Paris salons.
