    "description": "<p>Writing in 1913 to his friend the American art historian Walter Pach, Raymond Duchamp-Villon declared, &quot;The power of the machine imposes itself upon us and we can scarcely conceive living bodies without it.&quot; That year the French sculptor began his preliminary sketches and clay studies for <em>Horse</em>, progressively abstracting these initial naturalistic renderings of the animal\u2019s anatomy into a coiled configuration of geometric forms suggestive of pistons, gears, and shafts. Optimistically embracing the clean aesthetic and dynamic potential of the machine, Duchamp-Villon reinterpreted the traditional subject of equestrian sculpture for the modern era. The artist completed only a small plaster of the final version of Horse; he died before he could realize his plans to enlarge and cast it in bronze. This was done by his brothers, Jacques Villon and Marcel Duchamp, in 1930\u201331.</p>\n",
