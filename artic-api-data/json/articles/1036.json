    "copy": " Standing in the galleries with his painting, A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano , 1936, he described the malaise or unease his work evoked: \u201cthe dissociated objects . . . appear in the same connection as in dreams. Each person can be several people at the same time.\u201d   After Dal\u00ed joined Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s surrealist movement in Paris in 1929, it wasn\u2019t long before he became equally known for his public persona as his intricately detailed paintings of recognizable subjects distorted into elaborate dreamlike scenes. Dal\u00ed called his approach the \u201cparanoiac-critical\u201d method and took inspiration from psychoanalysis \u201cto systemize confusion and . . . discredit completely the world of reality. The new images which paranoiac thought may suddenly release . . . will be at the service of the unconscious.\"   Through doubling and disappearance, Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings from this period employed a detailed realism combined with layered personal and literary references to create an acute tension. His work appeared to turn away from the outside world even as it became increasingly unavoidable in the years leading up to the outbreak of World War II. Yet his paintings also uncovered a vision of monstrous beings lurking beneath images of self and society. When Dal\u00ed returned to Europe in early 1937, he painted Inventions of the Monsters amid mounting conflicts across Europe. Just one year after the Spanish Civil War started in his homeland in 1936, Dal\u00ed began this work in his Paris studio at 101 bis rue de la Tombe-Issoire.   He completed it while vacationing in the Austrian Alps in the spring of 1937, just a year before Adolf Hitler\u2019s Germany annexed Austria in March 1938. With a dark composition and dense imagery, the painting\u2019s ominous tone reflects the uncertainty of the time. Within a barren landscape flanked by fiery red clouds, the composition connects seemingly disparate bodies and scenes. To the left, hybrid centaur-like beings bathe in a pool of water across from a giraffe engulfed in flames.   Although one side of the painting revolves around water and the other fire, with a symmetry of opposites, beings on both sides morph into different types of monstrous images. In the foreground, doubled portraits of the artist and his wife Gala echo the central stage-like scene featuring a bust removing the head of a horse and a cat-masked angel.   Through careful illusionism, each figure is doubled except for the lower right of the composition where a nearly invisible shadow of a blue dog disappears into the dark landscape.   Dal\u00ed noted the curious tension between the duplicity of the monstrous figures and the disappearing dog when he sent a telegram congratulating the Art Institute of Chicago on the purchase of Inventions of the Monsters in 1943. He wrote, \u201cThe apparition of monsters presages the outbreak of war.\u201d Noting the \u201cprophetic character\u201d of the canvas, he described each figure as divine, metaphysical, or sentimental monsters before concluding \u201cthe little blue dog alone is not a true monster.\u201d Despite the apocalyptic reading of the imagery that Dal\u00ed offered while he was in exile in the United States, he also suggested a loss of innocence in the disappearing dog. Brimming with conflicting imagery, the composition of Inventions of the Monsters hints at the artist\u2019s complex and unresolved explorations of fascism, desire, and self-reflection. Over the course of the 1930s, Dal\u00ed\u2019s peers in the surrealist movement in Europe increasingly called for art and artists to openly commit to the fight against the rise of fascism. Beginning in 1934, Dal\u00ed\u2019s refusal to take a clear stance led to his formal expulsion from the movement, with his paintings and statements deemed by his colleagues \u201ccounter-revolutionary acts tending toward the glorification of Hitlerian fascism.\u201d   While Dal\u00ed denied the accusations, his public statements and artworks including Inventions of the Monsters were decidedly ambiguous as they reflected the internal strife of the political moment without making overt references. In keeping with the tenets of paranoic-critical painting, these works also left questions of interpretation or judgment to the beholder. Instead, Dal\u00ed created an internal tension within the composition, drawing from his recent interest in the myth of Narcissus as an image of metamorphosis, self-obsession, and loss. In the lower left side of Inventions of the Monsters , Dal\u00ed carefully rendered a split, doubled, and blended self-portrait with Gala, which he deemed \u201csentimental monsters,\u201d in his telegram. Dal\u00ed based the image on a photograph taken in New York in early 1937 by the exiled German photographer Eric Schaal.   Reversing the illusionistic photograph of their overlapping faces that merge into a single deformed figure, the composition echoes Dal\u00ed\u2019s poem that accompanied his painting, Metamorphosis of Narcissus , 1937:   Narcissus, in his immobility, absorbed by his reflection [. . .] becomes invisible. [. . . ] When that head slits [. . .] it will be the flower, the new Narcissus, Gala\u2014my Narcissus.   Just as the poem plays with the dark undertones of losing oneself in the reflection of another, a related drawing Formation of the Monsters ( 1937) further multiplies and transforms the divided and doubled figures of Dal\u00ed and Gala.   Despite the carefully rendered features in the drawing, the figures appear in the painting with hollowed eyes and less-defined features that subtly evoke skulls. Within the tumultuous political landscape of the 1930s, Inventions of the Monsters does not take an overt political stance but instead, explores unconscious desires, fears, and anxieties as they relate to our experiences of history as it unfolds. By vanishing, doubling, and transforming figures in the composition, this work sparks the same sense of unease for viewers. It invites us to reflect on the monstrous tensions underlying the political upheaval of the 1930s that still resonate in moments of crisis today. Repeated and replicated figures fill the landscape as the faintly rendered blue dog comes in and out of view within a blue-green halo against the barren ground. Exploring themes of metamorphosis, disappearance, and the shifting identities of selves and others, Inventions of the Monsters reveals a brooding reflection of society at the crossroads of history. \u2014Marin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr, assistant curator of painting and sculpture, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art   See Inventions of the Monsters and other works by the artist in the exhibition Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears , on view until June 12.   citations Marcia Winn, \u201cSurrealist is Mystified by his Own Art,\u201d Chicago Tribune (January 24, 1937), 17.
