    "description": "<p>Photographs, correspondence, and printed matter documenting a selection of German-American architect Peter J. Weber\u2019s (1863\u20131923) built and unbuilt projects in the United States and abroad, though predominantly in the Chicago area. Projects represented in this collection span from his early years as a student at Berlin\u2019s Charlottenburg Institute in the late 1880s, through his appointment as the assistant to Charles B. Atwood, the designer-in-chief of Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, to his tenure with Chicago\u2019s D.H. Burnham and Company in the 1890s and then to the establishment of his own firm in 1900, which he maintained until his death in 1923. Examples of Weber\u2019s work include the Silversmith Building, Chicago, IL; the Fisher Building Annex, Chicago, IL; the Seattle Public Library, Seattle, WA; and Ravinia Park, Highland Park, IL.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Weber,%20Peter%20J.,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Weber,%20Peter%20J.,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm4/results.php?CISOOP1=exact&CISORESTMP=results.php&CISOVIEWTMP=item_viewer.php&CISOMODE=grid&CISOGRID=thumbnail%2CA%2C1%3Btitle%2CA%2C1%3Bcreato%2CA%2C0%3Brelati%2C200%2C0%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%3B20%3Btitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOBIB=title%2CA%2C1%2CN%3Bsubjec%2CA%2C0%2CN%3Bdescri%2C200%2C0%2CN%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%2CN%3Bnone%2CA%2C0%2CN%3B20%3Btitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOTHUMB=20+%284x5%29%3Btitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOTITLE=20%3Btitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOHIERA=20%3Bsubjec%2Ctitle%2Cnone%2Cnone%2Cnone&CISOSUPPRESS=1&CISOPARM=%2Fcasc+%2Fhalic+%2Fmagic+%2Fmqc+%3ACISOSEARCHALL%3AWeber%2C+Peter+J.\">Find all Peter J.
