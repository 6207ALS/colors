    "description": "<p>Jewelry is an important and meaningful form of visual expression for North African women. Silver and gold are used to create ornaments including anklets, bracelets, clasps, headdresses, necklaces, and pendants. An array of specialized techniques is employed to embellish jewelry, including enameling, niello, and the inclusion of beads of amber, ebony, glass, and other elements.<br>This necklace is composed of carefully selected amber and amber-colored beads ranging in color from bright red-orange to a much darker red-brown. The beads are of graduated sizes with the central and largest approximately two inches in diameter. Some of the beads may be made of copal, a reddish tree resin, or a synthetic material simulating amber. The use of faux amber has been a common practice across North Africa, where amber has become highly prized since the early 20th century. Necklaces of this style can be found across culturally related regions of North Africa on both sides of the Sahara; this necklace is reportedly from Agadez, Niger, a stronghold of the Tuareg people since the 14th century.</p>\n",
