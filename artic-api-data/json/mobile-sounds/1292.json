    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this gallery you will find paintings, sculpture and decorative arts from the seventeenth and eighteenth century France. This extravagantly carved and gilded side table was made in France around 1735. It is richly carved with undulating curves and forms derived from natural sources such as shelves, leaves and branches. This style is known as rococo. It was named after the French word rocaille which described the fanciful rock work used to embellish waterfalls and grottos in aristocratic gardens. Notice also the heads at either end of the table personifying the winds ready to blow a gentle breeze. Originally, the table was likely placed beneath a hanging mirror made in the same style. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: Imagine this in candlelight at the end of the day when the light would flicker and be reflected by these many different curves and carvings making it seem almost alive.</p>\n",
