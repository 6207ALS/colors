Robinson, 1947.918\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent light-green glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rim, rounded by reheating, flares out and is then infolded, sitting horizontally on a long, cylindrical neck. From the neck, the wall spreads out into a short, inverted piriform body with a rounded bottom and a pontil mark. The neck is decorated with a thin, spiraling trail wound around twenty times. Four heavy trails, roughly equally spaced, are applied at the shoulder and pulled up and over the rim, having been touched to the neck four or five times to create elaborate handles. For a zoomable image, see fig. 135.1.\n\nOne handle and part of the rim is missing and repaired with a segment of nonjoining handle. Some brown incrustation adheres to the thick weathering product and is flaking away to reveal brilliant iridescence.\n\nThis is an unusual vessel in that it would not stand without a separate device or would have to be suspended from the looped handles below the rim. The vessel profile is unusual for this type of elaborate trail decoration.\n\nSome examples of tubular unguentaria with elaborate trail decoration have a tooled foot; the bottom of this flask has a pontil mark and clearly never had a foot. It appears to be a form somewhere between the single unguent container on a foot and the multicompartmented unguentaria that were always suspended by their prominent handles.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Antonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 275, no. 453, and illustrated again in the text, p. 30, fig. 57, a single vessel with elaborate trail decoration on a substantial foot; Stern, Roman, Byzantine, and Early Medieval Glass, p. 318, no. 180; p. 320, no. 182 is a typical double unguentarium with elaborate trail decoration and bale handles.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 135 Bottle, 4th/6th century A.D.\n\nfig. 135.1 Bottle (4th/6th century A.D.).
