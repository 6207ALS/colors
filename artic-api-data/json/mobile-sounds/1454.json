    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Etruscans lived along the western coast of Italy and traded heavily with the Greeks. They imitated Greek pottery but also developed a distinctive artistic style of their own. This bronze foot was once part of a cosmetic storage box or cista that held the combs, makeup and perfumes of an aristocratic Etruscan woman.</p>\n<p>TERAH WALKUP:  The face of this figure is typical of Etruscan art.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:   Terah Walkup of the Art Institute\u2019s Department and Ancient Byzantine Art.</p>\n<p>TERAH WALKUP:  We see a figure who is skipping across the ocean\u2019s waves perhaps the Etruscan sun god Usil bouncing, almost dancing. And there\u2019s almost a slight smile to the face.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The gentle curve of the wings and rows of curls are also typical of Etruscan art.</p>\n<p>TERAH WALKUP:  The eyes are wide and almond shaped. And the eyebrows are arched. The head looks gently down and the artist has described the torso with a very high degree of naturalism. This is in contrast to the very stylized pose typical of archaic Greek art.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Etruscans combined local copper and tin to make bronze. Thanks to artistry like this their wares found ready markets in the north and west of the Mediterranean region.<br>Terah Walkup:  So while the Etruscans had a taste for Greek pottery and ceramics the rest of the Mediterranean world had a taste for Etruscan bronze.&quot;</p>\n",
