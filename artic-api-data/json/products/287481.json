    "description": "Claude Monet was singularly devoted to capturing fleeting moments and impressions on canvas. The brisk seaside air at a Sainte-Adresse resort. Sunset reflected on melting snow at Louveciennes. The play of color and light on his beloved lily pond at Giverny. Although his style would change and mature, Monet\u2019s interest in how we perceive nature is ever present in his paintings. His desire to record his perceptions in the open air, in his own style, led him to reject rigid rules of subject matter and composition. With his unbridled colors and flickering brushstrokes, Monet laid the foundation for Impressionism, one of the most influential art movements in recent centuries. The 12 paintings in this calendar span more than 50 years of his illustrious career.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> Closed 12 x 13 x .125 in, Open 12 x 26 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials:</strong> High-quality printing with soy-based inks on premium, environmentally sourced paper stock, and easy to write on grid pages</li>\n</ul>",
