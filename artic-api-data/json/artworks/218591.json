    "description": "<p>A dancer by training, Kata K\u00e1lm\u00e1n took up photography in 1931 and quickly embraced the politically engaged documentary movement known in parts of central Europe as \u201csocial photography.\u201d She produced many portraits of the homeless and hungry with closely framed views that solicit compassion chiefly through intense, detailed depictions of facial expressions. In 1937 K\u00e1lm\u00e1n published a collection of these images in her first, sensational photobook <em>Tiborc</em>, named after the oppressed character in J\u00f3zsef Katona\u2019s 1821 novel <em>The Viceroy (B\u00e1nk b\u00e1n)</em>. The album tells personal stories of hardship through photographic portraits and accompanying biographical vignettes. This photograph, along with the corresponding text, relates the subject\u2019s experiences of intense physical labor and suffering; at age 23, he is prematurely aged and worn out from factory work. Reviewers praised K\u00e1lm\u00e1n\u2019s book for its ingenuity and honesty.</p>\n",
