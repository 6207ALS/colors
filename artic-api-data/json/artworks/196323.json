    "description": "<p>\u201cMake no little plans,\u201d Daniel H. Burnham reputedly exclaimed around the time he unveiled his <em>Plan of Chicago</em>, the first comprehensive metropolitan plan in the United States. Providing the vocabulary for Chicago architecture through the 1920s, the project was the legacy of Burnham, whose renown in large-scale city planning began when he was chief of construction for Chicago\u2019s 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition. Commissioned by the Commercial Club of Chicago, the plan was developed with the assistance of architect Edward H. Bennett, who elaborated parts of it after Burnham\u2019s death in 1912 and was responsible for executing many of its recommendations. Emulating the grand classical design of European cities, Chicago was to become \u201ca Paris by the Lake.\u201d Features included the development of Chicago\u2019s lakefront and Lake Shore Drive, the construction of Grant Park, and the transformation of Michigan Avenue into a premier commercial boulevard following the completion of the Michigan Avenue bridge. Eleven of the seventeen perspective views were rendered by Burnham\u2019s frequent collaborator, the Beaux-Arts-trained Jules Gu\u00e9rin. The draftsman\u2019s stunning, impressionistic views, with their unusual perspectives and dramatic use of color, bring the <em>Plan of Chicago</em> to life, imbuing it, as Burnham stated about his own aims, with the \u201cmagic to stir men\u2019s blood.\u201d</p>\n",
