    "description": "<p>The so-called <em>cadavre exquis</em> or exquisite corpse, a Surrealist visual game, was created in winter 1925\u201326, when members of the group gathered in the evenings. If conversation lagged, they invented games to spark the unconscious. The exquisite corpse grew out of one such invention, which reimagined the children\u2019s game of \u201chead, body, legs,\u201d in which each participant adds to a drawing without seeing the preceding contributions, which are hidden by folding the paper. The results are strange, sometimes violent, combinations of images. The Surrealists produced many such drawings (the Art Institute has several; for example, <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119117/exquisite-corpse>2018.333</a>, <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119118/exquisite-corpse>2018.334</a>, and <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119116/exquisite-corpse>2018.335</a>), and these collaborative experiments were profoundly influential. The Chicago-based Hairy Who artists also played the game in the late 1960s, but with more playful results (for example, <a href=\u201chttps://www.artic.edu/artworks/230914/exquisite-corpse>2018.684</a>, <a href =https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230915/exquisite-corpse>2018.685</a>, <a href =https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230916/exquisite-corpse>2018.686</a>, <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230917/exquisite-corpse>2018.687</a>, <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230918/exquisite-corpse>2018.688</a>, and <a href=https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230919/exquisite-corpse>2018.689</a>).</p>\n",
