    "description": "<p>Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Louis Betts (1873\u20131961) studied art under his father, painter Edward D.B. Betts, before attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. The young Betts also studied in New York under William Merritt Chase. After further travel and study in Europe between 1903 and 1905, he returned to Chicago for several years. In 1910 Betts moved permanently to New York, where he established himself as a society portraitist, exhibiting at the National Academy of Design, Macbeth Galleries, and the Carnegie Institute. Betts was president of the Salmagundi Club from 1933 to 1935 and was vice-president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Gathered by Prof. William Pattison, of the University of Chicago, during research on Betts portraits at the university, this collection is comprised of correspondence, exhibition catalogs, published and unpublished material, and photographs and transparencies of Betts\u2019s own work.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Betts,%20Louis,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
