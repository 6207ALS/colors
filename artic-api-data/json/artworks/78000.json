After his return to Chicago, an exhibition of his work at the Art Institute attracted the attention of Julius Rosenwald\u2014president of Sears, Roebuck and Company\u2014and the lawyer Lessing Rosenthal. Together they gathered a group of 20 Jewish professionals to purchase <em>To the Dance</em> for the museum. The group\u2019s support of Gaspard, a Jewish immigrant, signaled their commitment to a modernism based on cross-cultural affinities. They also may have felt a special regard for New Mexico, which was a tolerant home for Jews during the Spanish Inquisition.</p>\n",
