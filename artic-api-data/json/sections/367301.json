This study is the only one of the four transfer lithographs to which no references are made either in the writings of the Pennells or in Whistler\u2019s correspondence. The portrait had been erased from the stone by July 1896, when the first edition of T. R. Way\u2019s catalogue was published. In all likelihood, Whistler asked the Ways to erase it once he saw that the other likenesses of Pennell were more successful. Certainly, the artist seems to have struggled with this image\u2014which was drawn on the transfer paper with a grained-stone texture favored by T. R. Way but initially rejected by Whistler\u2014and it may have been the first of the four portraits he undertook. Repeated attempts were made to define the outline of the jacket; the area where Pennell\u2019s hand enters his pocket is awkwardly drawn; and his left arm and hand are difficult to read. The sketch displays numerous uncertainties and areas of reworking that Whistler, with his dislike of the visible traces of labor, would no doubt have judged harshly.\n\nAs was often the case, the artist was willing to sign and sell a handful of impressions of this lithograph, despite his dissatisfaction with the image. At the time of Whistler\u2019s death, no impressions remained in his estate.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove Japanese vellum (310 \u00d7 232 mm), signed; MWC, cream wove Japanese vellum (310 \u00d7 231 mm), signed.
