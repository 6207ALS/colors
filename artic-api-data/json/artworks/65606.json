The pale bluish-green color of the bowl occured naturally, as the result of iron and other oxides in the sand, one of the essential components used in making glass.</p>\n<p>Initially affordable among only the wealthy, glass was used widely in the Roman world to create a variety of everyday objects such as those displayed here, including delicate cosmetic containers that held perfumes and oils and various forms of tableware designed for serving food and drink. Glass was also used to imitate precious stones in jewelry.</p>\n",
