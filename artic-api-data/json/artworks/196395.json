    "description": "<p>Alexander Gardner documented America\u2019s Civil War, concentrating on scenes in camp as well as the tragic aftermath of fighting. After the war, in 1865, he published Gardner\u2019s Photographic Sketch Book of the War, two volumes of 50 prints each accompanied by floridly written descriptions of the scenes he and his photographic staff had witnessed. At Gettysburg\u2014one of the deadliest battles, and a turning point in the conflict\u2014he made the now iconic photograph of a Confederate sharpshooter in his final resting place. In recent years this picture has invited controversy, as historians have argued that Gardner and his assistants, wishing to heighten the impact of the image, moved the corpse, also seen in another photograph in the Sketch Book, and that the gun was in fact the photographer\u2019s and not the soldier\u2019s.</p>\n",
