    "description": "<p>Renowned performance artists Eiko Otake and Koma Otake, known as the groundbreaking duo Eiko and Koma, present solo performances in response to the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibition/provoke-photography-japan-between-protest-and-performance-1960-1975\"><em>Provoke: Photography in Japan between Protest and Performance</em><em>, 1960\u201375</em></a>. Eiko performs <em>A Body in the Art Institute</em>, an intimate meditation on how a frail, itinerant body can occupy a public space with surprising force. Following this performance, Koma presents a variation on his first solo work <em>The Ghost Festival</em>, a Tango-inflected evocation of what haunts us. The work of both artists reflects the influence, however muted by time, of the Provoke movement of 1960s Japan. </p><p>*Museum admission is free for Illinois resident every Thursday, 5:00-8:00\u2013including during this event.</p><p><strong>About the Artists</strong></p><p>Born and raised in Japan, Eiko Otake is a New York\u2013based interdisciplinary artist, performer, and choreographer.
