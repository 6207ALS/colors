    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: There is a strong Japanese influence in this American-made cabinet. The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERT:After the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, where the Japanese government had a section of the exhibition, Americans really fell in love with Japan. And so what Herter Brothers is doing, was evoking Japanese objects that they had seen. They use a technique called &quot;ebonizing,&quot; in which they paint the wood black so that it looks like a Japanese lacquer box. And the inlay suggests the kind of decoration you might have on a lacquer box that would have been in gold.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The firm's chief designer in these years was Christian Herter, who had immigrated to the United States from Germany as a young man.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS:  He is using other motifs as well, like the Egyptian revival claw feet you see here &lt;laughs&gt;. This was the period of the Aesthetic Movement, designers like Christian Herter, who would freely combine these motifs from different cultures, as long as they still created a sense of overall harmony. Herter Brothers worked for the highly wealthy classes in New York, at the end of the 19th century. And a piece like this would cost an immense amount to make.</p>\n",
