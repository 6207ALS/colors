    "description": "<p>Thursday, May 23, 2018<br>1:00pm\u20132:00pm CST</p><p>Art Insights provides a historical and enlightening experience of art enrichment for older members of the community, who are unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is please to partner with Senior Centers Without Walls to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based Art Insights conversations at a national scale. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or web-connected computer.</p><p><em>John Singer Sargent, Bon Vivant</em>, will be presented by Art Insights volunteer lecturer David Williams. John Singer Sargent painted portraits of the most prominent members of Gilded Age Society during the late nineteenth century. He enjoyed life to the fullest, not without scandal. Join us for a fun discussion of his life; and take a peak at a few of his best known works, soon to be on exhibit at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>This virtual presentation is hosted by Senior Center Without Walls, a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who connect via phone or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p><p>><strong>*For more information or to register, please call (877) 797-7299 or visit www.SeniorCenterWithoutWalls.org.</strong>Art Insights is generously funded by the Hulda B. and Maurice L.
