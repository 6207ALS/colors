    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This lavishly stocked market stall was painted by Frans Snyders in 1614.  Snyders lived and worked in Antwerp, the southern Netherland's richest city.  He specialized in animal depictions.  Martha Wolff:</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: So what we have here is a tour de force of Frans Snyders as he treats the subject of market stalls and also by implication, I think, hunting pictures, because he has a lot of game mixed into the abundance of offerings on the market stall.  We have a dead swan, we have a deer, a boar, a peacock, and hares, and smaller birds as well, and we also have a witty play between the offerings in the market stall and the human and animal figures.  The man who is the keeper of the stall and who doffs his hat to the viewer is perhaps not paying sufficient attention to the boy who's about to pick his pocket on the left, and a similar kind of moralistic play perhaps occurs with the fighting cocks that are shown underneath the table and the cat that's watching them, perhaps ready to pounce on the weaker of the cocks.  You just see the glowing eyes of the cat underneath the market table.</p>\n",
