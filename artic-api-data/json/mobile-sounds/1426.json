    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: From a surrounding riot of willows and reeds a footbridge arches across a waterlily pond. With its dense vegetation and lack of human presence, this garden may seem uncultivated. But it had been carefully crafted by the artist Claude Monet specifically for its function as a painting subject. He even went so far as diverting a nearby river in order to freshen the water of the pond. Monet\u2019s early interest in Japanese art from woodblock prints to ornamental fans gradually gave way to a greater appreciation for their way of seeing nature. Although, his garden north of Paris in the town of Giverny included a variety of domestic flowers, he paid special attention to the Japanese elements of the footbridge and the water lilies. Here\u2019s Gloria Groom, curator of European painting.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: What\u2019s wonderful about this is this is sort of the culmination of his interest in Japanese art which begins very early in his career, its private, and it's all about what he has not only created but now chosen to paint.</p>\n",
