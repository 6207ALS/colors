    "description": "<p>Born in Chenecey-Buillon, France, Alice Rahon (born Marie Yvonne Philppot) attended Surrealist gatherings as a young woman living in Paris. Invited in 1935 by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/3226/andre-breton\" target=\"_blank\">Andr\u00e9 Breton</a> to join the Surrealist group, Rahon published several volumes of poetry, including <em>A\u0300 me\u0302me la terre (On Bare Ground) </em>(1936) and <em>Sablier couche\u0301 (Reclining Hourglass)</em> (1938). While journeying through the Pacific Northwest alongside her husband, Austrian-born artist <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/42737/wolfgang-paalen\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Inter, -apple-system, -system-ui, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;\">Wolfgang Paalen</a>, and photographer Eva Sulzer in 1939, Rahon began making drawings that were inspired by the totemic carvings she encountered there. While Rahon and Paalen\u2019s relocation to North America was intended as a brief respite from World War II, their self-imposed exile from Europe lasted decades. They joined the community of avant-garde artists in Mexico City and Rahon found a new creative voice in painting, pursued along with sculpture, marionette theatre, and filmmaking over the next 40 years.</p><p>Rahon\u2019s first paintings were supposedly created from the leftover bits of paint that she scraped from Paalen\u2019s palette, and images of her drawings and paintings were printed in the interdisciplinary journal he edited <em>Dyn </em>(1942\u201344). Drawn to the hybrid form of the <em>tableau-poe\u0300me,</em> which combines text and image, Rahon first exhibited her paintings in January 1940 at the International Exhibition of Surrealism in Mexico City. Taking inspiration from the Mexican landscape, she incorporated natural elements\u2014such as black sand and ash, as well as dried leaves, feathers, and occasionally butterfly wings\u2014into her works. After establishing a richly textured surface, and often while it was still wet, she would incise the paint surface with a stylus, blending painting and drawing, and inscribe intricate networks of linear figures reminiscent of the earliest forms of Paleolithic painting (as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/257310/peau-de-soleil\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Inter, -apple-system, -system-ui, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;\"><em>Peau de soleil</em></a><em style=\"font-family: Inter, -apple-system, -system-ui, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; font-weight: 400;\">, </em>1944). Her surfaces became increasingly matte and dry, evoking the texture and subtle luster of sandpaper overlaid with cloud-like applications of raw pigment (as in <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/257312/self-portrait-and-autobiography\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"background-color: transparent; font-family: Inter, -apple-system, -system-ui, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-variant-ligatures: inherit; font-variant-caps: inherit;\"><em>Self-Portrait and Autobiography</em></a>, 1948).&nbsp;</p><p>Recalling an influential 1933 visit to the famous early cave paintings in Altamira, Spain, Rahon remarked, \u201cIn earliest times painting was magical; it was a key to the invisible ... the value of a work lay in its powers of conjuration, a power that talent alone could not achieve.\u201d After becoming a Mexican citizen in 1946 and divorcing Paalen in 1947, the artist reanointed herself as Alice Rahon, claiming her mother\u2019s maiden name and establishing an independent identity.</p>",
