Though his arresting gaze invites the viewer in, his face is also turned away and cast partially in shadow, as if he seeks to keep his distance from the individual on the other side of the picture plane. Other versions of this composition exist, suggesting that the man\u2019s mysterious character and distinctive appearance captivated many artists and patrons of his time.</p>\n",
