    "description": "<p>Art Shay is one of Chicago\u2019s great photojournalists. With more than 25,000 published photographs\u2014including more than 1,000 magazine covers\u2014Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.</p>\n<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs\u2014of an American military air disaster\u2014were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay\u2019s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.<br>\u2014 Permanent collection label</p>\n<p>\u201cLiz Taylor and her then-husband Eddie Fisher diplomatically made believe they were enjoying Smell-O-Vision at the Mike Todd Theatre. The redoubtable, purple-eyed Hollywood angel descended on Chicago to introduce the ill-fated enterprise of her late husband Mike Todd and his son\u2014Smell-O-Vision. With the starring couple of Scent of Mystery shown in an orange grove, Smell-O-Vision was going to add an extra sense to the enjoyment of movies. A Rube Goldberg setup based in the theater basement wafted up the scent of orange blossoms to the audience. When the leading lady came close to the camera you would smell her perfume over all the other smells. In the basement the smell machines involved looked like the engine room of a nuclear submarine. The whole idea was one of Todd\u2019s few financial flops, but Liz played the inheriting widow with wit, rue, and wisdom. Critics agreed it stank.\u201d<br>\u2014Art Shay</p>\n",
