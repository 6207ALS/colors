This sheet is notable for its deftly applied brown wash, including thick strokes, quick accents, and sinuous contours. The result is eloquently pictorial, which suggests that Salviati may have intended it as an independent work of art.</p>\n<p>Salviati\u2019s bravura graphic performance is matched by his deft interpretation of the subject, especially in the balletic pose of the young soldier balanced on one foot as he gingerly lifts the curtain.</p>\n",
