It is the most elaborate of the five transfer drawings of the Thames (cat. 154, cat. 155, cat. 156, cat. 157, and cat. 158) recorded from the balcony of Whistler\u2019s suite at the top of the Savoy Hotel, where he and Beatrix resided during February and March 1896. In his catalogue T. R. Way identified many of the landmarks included in the lithograph. The pinnacles of Examination Hall are in the left foreground, and a segment of Waterloo Bridge, bustling with traffic, is seen directly below the artist\u2019s vantage point. The Victoria Embankment curves away in the distance toward Blackfriars Bridge and the bend in the river at King\u2019s Reach. To the left of the far bridge are the twin towers and long roof of Cannon Street Station and, looming on the horizon, the great dome and towers of St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.\n\nWhen he drew Little London, Whistler seems to have included touches of stump work in the sky at the far left and upper center of the composition. However, by the time he produced this image, probably the last of his Thames transfer drawings, he knew that stumping directly upon the transfer paper could not be relied upon to process well (see cat. 157). Instead, he waited until the image had been transferred to stone to add the majority of the stump work. Whistler used stumping extensively to add delicate tonal areas to the water\u2019s edge, to the dome of St. Paul\u2019s, to the trees along the Embankment, and to the pinnacles in the foreground. He used the stump much like a brush to create the elaborate cloud formations in the sky. No proofs have been located to suggest the appearance of the image prior to these additions to the stone.\n\nLittle London and Charing Cross Railway Bridge (cat. 157) are probably the two drawings transferred and proved by the Ways on 23 March 1896 (app. II.4).\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (301 \u00d7 177 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (301 \u00d7 173 mm), signed; Palmer, tan wove proofing paper (287 \u00d7 222 mm).
