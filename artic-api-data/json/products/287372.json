    "description": "Many people know that Paul C\u00e9zanne (1839\u20131906) was a French painter whose work and influence linked Post-Impressionism and Cubism. What, perhaps, they don't know is that he was best friends with French novelist \u00c9mile Zola until a disagreement ended their friendship of 34 years; that his work was rejected by the Salon and mainstream art schools before his unique style received critical acclaim; that he died from pneumonia after refusing to stop painting in a thunderstorm; and that, in 2011, his iconic artwork The Card Players was sold for more than $250 million. This book presents an instant impression of his life, work and fame, with an array of irresistible facts and figures converted into infographics to reveal the artist behind the pictures.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5.75 X 8.25 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 96</li></ul>",
