The other two are The Ox Cart (cat. 94) and Human Miseries (cat. 95). They can stand on their own, but, when placed end to end in the following order\u2014Wayside Shrine in Brittany (left), The Ox Cart (middle), and Human Miseries (right)\u2014they can be read as a frieze-like arrangement (see fig. 93.2).\n\nUnlike the plates of the Noa Noa Suite, most of which Gauguin titled within each image, thirteen of the fifteen wood-block plates that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints are unnamed. Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints).He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as Au roches noires (At the Black Rocks) (cat. 91).\n\nThis wood-block print is one of three that depict pastoral scenes in Brittany and Provence. When considered together, they form a sequence that can be read whether they are arranged as individual objects in a certain order or in a frieze-like arrangement, touching each other end to end (see fig. 93.2). The other two are The Ox Cart (cat. 94) and Human Miseries (cat. 95). Gauguin left no instructions as to how to display the prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after his death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \u201cHouse of Pleasure\u201d in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThis scene of a winter day in Brittany is framed by borders on all four sides. Dominating the left side of the composition is a calvary that is part of a roadside shrine. In the center, a female peasant herds a pair of oxen from left to right toward what might be a fenced enclosure. The heads of three more oxen emerge from the lower left corner. In the background, rooftops of a hamlet are seen against an undulating landscape of fields covered with snow. At the lower right, Gauguin wrote his initial, P, and the number 13 in pen and ink. The original wood-block matrix for this print is in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris (fig. 93.3).\n\nThe imagery and setting derive from several oil paintings Gauguin did in Brittany: from 1889 is Breton Calvary (The Green Christ) (fig. 93.4 [W 328]) and from 1894 Christmas Night (fig. 93.5 [W 519]), Breton Village in the Snow I (fig. 93.6 [W 524]), andBreton Village in the Snow II (fig. 93.7 [W 525]). The weathered stone calvary featured in the painting Wayside Shrine in Brittany is based on one from the fifteenth century still standing in the parish churchyard of the village of Nizon (Finist\u00e8re) (fig. 93.8). In his print, Gauguin focused on the shrine\u2019s lower scene, which shows the three Maries supporting the limp body of Christ after the Deposition. Gauguin appropriated the oxen from photographs he owned\u2014and took with him on his travels\u2014from Egyptian frescoes in the British Museum, London (the so-called Nebamun tomb frescoes) (fig. 93.9 and fig. 93.10).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This wood-block print was printed on a thin, translucent paper. The block itself was likely hewn from the same piece of wood that the artist also used for The Ox Cart (cat. 94); both prints are among the fifteen that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. Gauguin stated that half of the blocks for the suite were used twice, and it is probable that he carved the two matrices from the same plank, not by using the front and back as he had done with blocks in the past, but by sawing thick planks of wood in half laterally to create two thinner sections. All of the blocks were carved from indigenous wood; the majority of them are irregularly shaped, a characteristic that Gauguin exploited in some instances and ignored in others. It has been suggested that he used fragments of wood from crates or a piece of furniture to fashion some of these printing blocks. However, close study of the striations and tool marks in the wood, as well as their appearance in impressions where wood blocks are no longer extant, reveals that the artist used saw and plane to cut down and level larger and thicker pieces of the soft, more readily available wood that he could find in his immediate surroundings. In the block used for this print (see fig. 93.11), Gauguin retained the saw-cut series of vertical striations along the left side and around the perimeter of the block along the bottom. Elsewhere, he removed them with deep carving and sanding to smooth the surface. To retain as much of the piece of wood as possible he accepted its irregular edges along the top and bottom right, although the artist did reduce the irregularity along the top right corner.\n\nGauguin lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, yet the pronounced textures of wood grain and knots that printed along with his carved imagery are integral to the overall aesthetic appearance of the group. These irregularities set the prints apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images of his Noa Noa Suite. The Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints are wood-block prints in the true sense of the word: cut crudely into wood that was sawn, planed, and sanded to create work surfaces. These were far too prone to splintering to be incised with the tip of a needle, so the artist relied solely on the knife, drawing on his skill as a sculptor of wood in the round. Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin used a second, thicker paper to support the diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter paper. Using this technique Gauguin also prevented the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block or tearing when he lifted it from the block. A common characteristic among all of these secondary sheets is a pronounced vertical crease that appears along one vertical edge. Here, the crease introduced by the secondary support remains even though Gauguin ultimately separated the two sheets. The crease is readily visible in raking light, 49 mm in from the right edge of the sheet. Had the primary support been lined or laid down in a later intervention, this evidence would have been lost.\n\nThe wood block was printed in black ink. Gauguin deliberately distributed the ink unevenly on a block that was not flat and, when printed, this resulted in a reticulated impression that emphasizes the irregularities in the wood and enhances the uneven carving of incised lines (see fig. 93.12).\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with mitsumata fibers (est.) and minimal sizing to print the majority of impressions in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. The diaphanous sheets are translucent, extraordinarily fragile, and easily damaged. In this impression, the tissue-thin sheet was posthumously tipped on white Japanese paper in the four corners. Owing to the thinness of the sheet, the tone of any underlying support inevitably distorts its appearance. Here, the white sheet improves legibility and enhances the contrast of light and dark passages of thin and thick ink, respectively. The print retains its translucency, surface sheen, and diaphanous quality, protected in part by the secondary support.\n\n152 \u00d7 227 mm (image); 152 \u00d7 227 mm (primary support); 153 \u00d7 227 mm (secondary support)\n\nThe composition is contained within a border on all sides that reflects the irregular contours of the block and the organic forms they evoke. The majority of the composition relies on a linear structure formed by gouging away much of the wood\u2019s surface. Incised lines are added selectively throughout and vary in width. Here the artist discarded his fine incising needles in favor of a blade that could more sharply cut into the soft wood when used on its side and when used on its end to form thinner lines. The blade\u2019s cuts are most obvious in the shrine and figures, while the tip\u2019s incising is most visible in the distant mountains and animals.\n\nThe artist retained the striations of the saw; they appear along the right side of this impression, yet not a single impression printed during the artist\u2019s lifetime has been found with the striations printed in their entirety. Indeed, all of the sheets have been cropped or cut down, misleading the viewer to conclude that the print was derived from one of the smallest blocks in the group. It is only in impressions printed posthumously that all of the edges of the block are legible (fig. 93.13). In these impressions, the image measures 158 \u00d7 263 mm, far larger than any lifetime impressions identified to date. When the contours of the block as they appear in posthumous impressions of Wayside Shrine in Brittany are overlaid and compared with the contours of the edges of impressions of The Ox Cart, there are striking similarities. First, the saw-cut striations of the two prints match, as does an irregular depression central to the same area. Second, the contour along the top of each is almost identical. Gauguin, unsatisfied with simply cutting the wood in half and using the resulting pieces in the same orientation, took the block for Wayside Shrine and rotated it 180 degrees so that the striations appear to the left instead of the right. He trimmed the block along the top to provide a more regular shape and reduced its overall size by approximately 42 mm (see fig. 93.14).\n\nBefore coming into the museum\u2019s collection, the thin Japanese paper support was tipped onto a thin white Japanese paper. Adhesive appears in the four corners and has caused minor distortions to form. The artist irregularly cut the primary support, and the secondary support appears very slightly along its edges. The sheets were not cut together.\n\nThis print was mounted in the same way and using the same materials as the museum\u2019s second-state impression of Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2). They were acquired by the museum eight years apart and do not share a common provenance. Therefore, it is likely that they were mounted after they entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection.\n\nThe print is in good condition. It has been mounted with The Ox Cart and Human Miseries (cat. 95) to form a frieze (see also Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). The impressions were overlapped for visual continuity, and Japanese paper hinges were used to secure each to the mount.  \nHarriet K.

Christmas Night is assigned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art, where it resides, to 1902/3; the museum says that it might have been started in 1894 but that Gauguin finished it in Tahiti. Village in the Snow II was found in Gauguin\u2019s studio at his death. See Richard R. Brettell in Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F.

(National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice. See also cats. 96 and 97, 100 and 101, 102 and 103, and 104 and 105 for paired examples of extant wood blocks that originally formed one thicker block.\n\nComparison of a number of impressions indicates that this block measured approximately 305 \u00d7 230 mm. I was unable to locate a single impression in which all of the edges of the block were clearly printed. Either the sheet of paper shifted when it was lifted from the block, transferring additional ink along the edges, or one or more of the edges had been trimmed. It is equally likely that the papers were slightly smaller than the overall size of the block.\n\nLibuse S\u00fdkorova, Gauguin Woodcuts, trans. Till Gottheiner (P.

Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . .

Translation by Genevieve Westerby.\n\nIn Change of Residence (cat. 104.2), another print from this series, a vertical crease appears 49 mm in from the left edge of the sheet. Here, the secondary support was retained and the primary support was adhered to it.\n\nThe fact that this crease remains visible at all is a testament to the fact that the primary support was not posthumously laid down onto a secondary support, which would have flattened the crease in the process.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2), and mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nThe Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris, describes the block as long-grain indigenous Tahitian wood that measures 160 \u00d7 249 mm. They do not provide a thickness for the block.\n\nThe location of the block for The Ox Cart is unknown; the block for Wayside Shrine is in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris.\n\nDouglas W.
