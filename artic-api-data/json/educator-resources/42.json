    "copy": " Looming in the center of Peter Blume's painting is a monumental rock, fractured yet enduring, a powerful symbol of humanity's tenacity and capacity to survive. Men and women struggle to go on living and rebuilding in this postwar scene of destruction. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
