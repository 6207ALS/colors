With a few sure lines he captured the essence of the subject and revealed his skill as an animal draftsman. The vantage point he selected, with its focus shifting from the small crouching cat in the foreground to the rumps of the two horses across the courtyard, also suggests the humor Whistler found in such everyday subjects.\n\nThe Good Shoe was one of seven drawings (cat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125) on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler sent from Lyme Regis to his printers in London on 27 September 1894 (letter 141). The images were transferred to stone by the Ways on October 1 (app. II.4) and Whistler received the first proofs by October 10, when he wrote back to the printers expressing his disappointment with them (letter 145). A number of the images transferred badly, perhaps because the transfer paper had been damaged by the damp sea air, and impressions of some subjects, such as The Sunny Smithy (cat. 121) tend to be pale as a result. The Good Shoe seems to have transferred better than The Sunny Smithy, and impressions tend to be stronger and richer. Both lithographs reveal a textured pattern, as though Whistler had placed his thin transfer paper over a slightly rough surface when making the drawings.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 227 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 220 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (252 \u00d7 182 mm), signed; Palmer, cream wove Japanese vellum (311 \u00d7 231 mm), signed.
