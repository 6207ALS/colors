Renoir worked out his composition with a variety of chalk lines. He established the overall forms of the two figures with fairly thick lines, defined their hands and faces with delicate thin lines, and accentuated the hatbands, dress cuffs, and decorative ribbons with dense, broad strokes (fig. 13.1). The chalk was sufficiently hard to delicately render the clasped figures\u2019 hands. The artist created a sense of space around the two figures by lightly filling in the broad expanses with black chalk, and there is a vague suggestion of background at the upper right. Renoir extended the composition, filling the paper support and working up to 4 cm from the edges. Highlights were established by leaving the light tonality of the paper exposed (fig. 13.2). There is no evidence of stumping or erasure.\n\nThere is a faint drawing of a figure in black chalk on the verso (fig. 13.3; infrared detail,fig. 13.4).\n\nIvory (discolored to tan), medium-thick, moderately textured laid paper.\n\nL. Berville (right, top edge) (fig. 13.5).\n\nVertical, 2.8 cm.\n\n8\u20139 per cm.\n\nUniform, without visible inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven.\n\nThere are deckle edges at the top, right, and bottom; the left side is edge torn.\n\n492 \u00d7 319 mm.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible under normal conditions, in UV illumination, or with magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe work was drawn in black chalk. The rich black color and the fine, uniform appearance of the particles under magnification suggest that the chalk was synthetically produced. Various hardnesses of chalk were likely employed, as well. Renoir probably achieved the thin delicate lines in the figures\u2019 hands and faces with a hard black chalk, and he probably used a soft black chalk to accentuate elements of the clothing. There is no evidence of stumping or erasure.\n\nThere is a faint drawing of a figure in black chalk on the verso at the bottom of the sheet.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo artistic surface fixative or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe ivory paper has discolored overall to tan and is darkest along the bottom edge and on the verso. The bottom edge is creased, possibly from being formerly folded back upon the verso, where the paper was in direct contact with an acidic material that caused the paper to discolor. The paper along the bottom edge of the sheet on the verso, formerly in the interior of the fold, was protected from the acidic material and thus its tonality is preserved. The support was formerly adhered along the edges of the verso to an acidic secondary support, contributing to the pronounced discoloration on the verso. Residual white paper and adhesive are evident on the verso. A few edge tears, visible along the top, the lower right, and the bottom edges of the verso are stabilized by the former mount remnants.\n\nLight media transfer is visible around the perimeter on the recto. It is most pronounced along the top edge. There are stray marks in blue colored pencil (a similar medium to that used in the marks) along the upper half of the right edge.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly Ambroise Vollard (1867\u20131939), Paris.\n\nPurchased jointly by M.
