    "description": "<p>Claude Cahun, born Lucy Schwob, was closely associated with the Paris Surrealists of the 1930s. Attracted to the group\u2019s desire to transform society through the exploration of the unconscious, she challenged traditional ideas about gender and sexuality through her intimate photographic self-portraits, collages, and sculptures. For <em>Object</em>, Cahun altered a number of seemingly unrelated components\u2014a doll\u2019s hand, a cloud-shaped piece of wood, and a tennis ball painted with a wide-open eye\u2014to produce a startling psychological resonance. The eye, in particular, a key Surrealist symbol of inner perception, also suggests female anatomy. On the base of the work, Cahun added the French phrase, \u201cThe Marseillaise is a revolutionary song, the law punishes counterfeiters with forced labor.\u201d Much like the rest of the work, the inscription is a juxtaposition of disparate elements: the first, a well-known slogan from France\u2019s antifascist coalition, the left-wing Popular Front, and the other, a phrase from Belgian currency. In combining these phrases, Cahun seems to point an accusatory finger at the supposed \u201crevolutionary\u201d leaders of France\u2014a rare direct reference to politics in a Surrealist artwork. Her assemblages were typically ephemeral and made to be photographed; <em>Object</em> is the only sculptural work by the artist known to still exist in its original form.</p>\n",
