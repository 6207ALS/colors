    "transcript": "<p>DENISE MAHONEY: The whole idea of a cocktail was definitely very new after Prohibition. People I believe.. it gave themselves an air of sophistication to be drinking cocktails. It was a very new thing, to be drinking out of this very streamline design.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The great America designer Norman Bel Geddes, was inspired by the skyscrapers of New York City when he produced this jazzy cocktail set. Made from chrome-plated brass rather than silver, it's a showpiece of art deco. Denise Mahoney of the Art Institute's Department of American Art.</p>\n<p>DENISE MAHONEY: It's also a useful piece too, it's not just a decoration. The Revere Copper and Brass Company were at this time trying to also figure out ways to make more money, because of the Depression. So they came out with this idea of a cocktail set as sort of.. a gift. Not too large, very simple, but still very striking. What I also find really interesting about the piece itself, the design, is how the cap on the cocktail shaker is also the cup, just with the addition of the stem and a base. So very economical in those terms as well.</p>\n",
