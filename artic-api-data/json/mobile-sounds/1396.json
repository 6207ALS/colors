    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This beautifully glazed ceramic sculpture was crafted for a wealtyh person\u2019s tomb. Take a look at the saddlebag, that monster face with wide eyes and protruding fangs may have been intended to protect the deceased in the afterlife. Here\u2019s Elinor Pearlstein, associate curator of Chinese art at the Art Institute.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN: The stance with the head thrown back and the mouth open to bray is absolutely classic.<br>Narrator:  As ungainly as they were indispensable, camels are also notoriously bad tempered. The Chinese relied on expert central Asian drivers in the caravans plying the trade routes. The foreign groom who rides with the camel wears a Persian or central Asian coat.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN:  This animal was really the only reliable means of transport across the vast waste of the overland Silk Roads.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: If it weren\u2019t for camels there might not have been a Silk Road. The two humps identify this fine specimen as a Bactrian camel from present day Afghanistan. Bactrian camels can travel thirty miles a day, carry hundreds of pounds and go for more than a week without water. These celebrated ships of the desert can also tolerate very hot and very cold temperatures which allows them to travel across the forbidding deserts and high mountain ranges that extend west out of China.</p>\n",
