    "description": "<p>This drawing relates closely to a painting in the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague (25.1995) in both subject matter and style.  However, it is nearly impossible to establish when the drawing was made or whether the drawing or painting came first. Prior to 1908, Piet Mondrian rarely dated his work; moreover, his artistic evolution is hard to trace chronologically since he made two kinds of work simultaneously: formally experimental landscapes and\u2014forced by his meager finances to appeal to buyers\u2014naturalistic scenes. Based on stylistic similarities to other works of that time, Robert Welsh, a scholar of Mondrian\u2019s early work, dated the sheet to around 1905.</p>\n",
