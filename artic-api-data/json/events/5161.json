    "short_description": "<p>Beverly Fishman (American, b. 1955) adopts the language of abstraction to explore the body, issues of identity, and contemporary culture. For more than three decades, she has used imagery drawn from science, medicine, and the pharmaceutical industry to promote inquiry into the effects of these institutions on both individuals and societies. She writes, \u201cI mine the histories of geometric and hard-edge abstraction and pop art; and I reconfigure them through strategies of appropriation and references to both living bodies and seductive objects. Thereby, I hope to provoke reflection on both art and society in an increasingly anxious, addicted, and divided time.\u201d</p>",
