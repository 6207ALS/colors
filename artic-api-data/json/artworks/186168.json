At Prairie Crossing, homeowners are encouraged to integrate native plantings and restored prairie into their landscaping and to recreate the true natural cycle of the prairie by burning it periodically.\n\nPrairie Crossing is a privately funded community, founded by Vicky and George Ranney and Dorothy and Gaylord Donnelly when a large parcel of farmland threatened by high-density development became available for purchase. They decided to use the land in a manner that was consonant with the rural character of the area. Funds generated from the sale of homes in the community have gone toward restoring surrounding prairie: sixty percent of the 677-acre site is protected open space, including 165 acres of restored prairie and 20 acres of restored wetlands. Sixteen acres of old hedgerows\u2014tough trees planted in columns by the pionners to act as a wind block\u2014have been preserved at Prairie Crossing, not only for their historic interest but also because they function as a wildlife corridor.\n\nHardier and more sustainable native plants require less water and maintenance than conventional flora, and serve an important function in cleansing storm water as it flows into local lakes. Prairie Crossing\u2019s Lake Aldo Leopold has water of such high quality that it was selected as a site for breeding endangered species of fish.\n\nBesides its commitment to environmental protection and enhancement, many other aspects of the community\u2019s development plan\u2014an onsite organic farm, a regional trail open to the public for hiking, biking, horseback riding and cross-country skiing, and a policy favoring economic and racial diversity\u2014serve to indicate that private development can not only be responsible, it can take a proactive role in saving and preserving endangered landscapes and promoting societal good. In the words of Vicky Ranney, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t save all the land you needed to if you depended on the government.\u201d\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
