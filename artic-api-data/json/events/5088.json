    "description": "<p>In this virtual program, artist Njideka Akunyili Crosby will speak with Jordan Carter, associate curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p><p>Drawing on art historical, political, and personal references, Njideka Akunyili Crosby (Nigerian, born 1983) creates densely layered figurative compositions that, precise in style, nonetheless conjure the complexity of contemporary experience.&nbsp;Her cultural identity combines strong attachments to the country of her birth and to her adopted home in the U.S., a hybrid identity that is reflected in her work.&nbsp;Akunyili Crosby notes, \u201cIn much the same way that inhabitants of formerly colonized countries select and invent from cultural features transmitted to them by the dominant or metropolitan colonizers, I extrapolate from my training in Western painting to invent a new visual language that represents my experience\u2014which at times feels paradoxically fractured and whole\u2014as a cosmopolitan Nigerian.\u201d</p><p>Presented by the Society for Contemporary Art <br>Sponsored by Richard Gleiner</p>",
