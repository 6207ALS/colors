The Little Steps, Lyme Regis was one of two drawings on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler mailed to his printers in London on 21 October 1895; the other subject was probably Sketch of a Blacksmith (cat. 130). Both images were transferred to stone and proved on October 24 (app. II.4).\n\nAlthough many of his Lyme Regis drawings had failed to transfer successfully and the resulting proofs were disappointing, Whistler had high hopes for The Little Steps, Lyme Regis. When he mailed the two drawings to the Ways on October 21, he cautioned the printers to put them on stone immediately, adding that the image of the steps and windows \u201cought to be a beauty\u201d (letter 147). Two days later he sent them another short note underscoring his concern that the processing go well (letter 149). He explained that he wanted \u201cthe drawing of the Steps and windows to come out beautifully\u2014with all the sweet quality of the \u2018Fruiti\u00e8re de la Rue de Grenelle\u2019\u2014or the Doctor\u2014Tell your Father to take plenty of time\u2014and [there] is no reason why we should not have all the \u2018bloom\u2019 upon it that I talked to you about.\u201d Whistler received the proofs on October 25. His distress and perplexity over their appearance are evident in the rather poignant response he sent to the Ways. He wrote, \u201cThe proofs however have gone wrong\u2014I can\u2019t make it out\u2014All that I sent you from Paris always came out beautifully. Certainly these \u2018Steps\u2019 have gone to pieces, entirely\u2014It was the best drawing of the lot\u201d (letter 150).\n\nDespite his disappointment, the artist cared enough for the image to rework the stone after his return to London from Lyme Regis. The lithograph was not included in the Fine Art Society exhibition, which opened in mid-December 1895. This would suggest that Whistler did not make his corrections to the stone until either late January or late March 1896, when a number of \u201crevises\u201d appear in the Way firm\u2019s account (app. II.4).\n\nThe image, as originally drawn and transferred, printed with many weak areas. Lines forming the steps printed across the figure at left, and the apron is unevenly shaded.\n\nLondon: BM, ivory wove proofing paper (277 \u00d7 211 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in Paris, private collection.\n\nNumerous small revisions have been made directly on the stone. Tone has been added to the apron and bodice of the woman in the doorway, to the head of the girl on the steps, to the shadowed recess in the doorway and lintel above, to the shadows in the panes of the upper bowed windows, and below the decorative railing surrounding those windows. The light lines defining the upper steps have been erased where they crossed the skirt of the girl on the left. The butterfly monogram has been reinforced.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, ivory wove paper (272 \u00d7 174 mm), signed.
