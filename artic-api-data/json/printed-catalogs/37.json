    "copy": " This publication inaugurates A+D (Architecture and Design), a new series from the Art Institute of Chicago, which highlights the work of important architects and designers from around the world. Innovatively designed by the New York firm 2x4, the titles are either historical in nature or investigate current critical thinking and practice in architecture and design.   This handsome book presents the oeuvre of Douglas Garofalo, principal of Garofalo Architects, internationally renowned for its innovative residential, commercial, institutional, and public building projects. With an impressive list of clients that includes the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Hyde Park Art Center, and the Smart Museum of Art at the University of Chicago, the firm has also designed a number of private residences and played a significant role in Chicago\u2019s urban design and public planning.   Douglas Garofalo looks at the architect\u2019s work to date, drawing from the full spectrum of his built work, theoretical and visionary projects (including the Camouflage House outside Chicago\u00ac\u00ac), and competition entries (including those for the Chicago Housing Authority and the Chicago Public Schools). Illustrations of and informative entries on the drawings, models, and digital media that showcase this work are featured.   Joseph Rosa 96 pages, 5 3/8 x 8 1/2 in. 60 color + 12 b/w ills.
