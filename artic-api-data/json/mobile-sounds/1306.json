    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This massive and lavishly decorated desk was made in Vienna, Austria in about 1812.  Its design includes many elements inspired by classical art.  The central part of the desk with its curved tapering shape recalls a classical lyre.  It is flanked by tall cornucopias which could have been used to display flowers.  Griffin figures, half lion, half eagle support the lower part of the desk and it rests on giant paws as ancient Roman furnishings sometimes did.  The desk's classical elements are a bow to the fashionable French empire style whose influence had spread across Europe by the early 19th Century.  This style was popularized by the Emperor Napoleon I who wanted the forms of Imperial Roman art to cast their august glory on the imagery of his own regime.  But if the desk looks to France for its design, its materials are purely Viennese in their rich variety of exotic veneers, ebonized surfaces, gilding and gilt bronze.</p>\n",
