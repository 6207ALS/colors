Harrison Collection, 1933.889\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet created Caricature of Jules Didier with charcoal and touches of white chalk on moderately textured blue laid sheet. The paper color provides a middle tone for the composition, with touches of white chalk added as highlights on the face and the insect body and wings. It appears that the artist first worked out the man\u2019s face with light, quick strokes of charcoal and then further developed it with darker, broader lines and shading. In contrast to the complex rendering of the face, the insect\u2019s body and wings are more generally established.\n\nO. Monet (recto, lower right corner, in charcoal).\n\nO. Monet (recto, partially removed, lower right corner, in charcoal).\n\nBlue, thick, moderately textured laid paper.\n\nMFDT, near the bottom left corner, vertical.\n\nHorizontal, 28\u201329 mm\n\n90\u2013100 mm\n\nIvory, dark-blue, medium-blue, and red fibers.\n\nSlightly uneven; in transmitted illumination this handmade paper has many circular thinned areas (often referred to as papermaker\u2019s tears) and clumps of fiber.\n\nThe sheet has four deckle edges.\n\n616 \u00d7 436 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using the tip or edge of a thick charcoal stick to establish the face and the form of the insect body and wings. Some of the charcoal lines have a brownish-black tonality, such as at the back of the man\u2019s head (fig. 10.1). Tonal effects were achieved using the edge of the charcoal stick with straight lines, whether vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. Monet created the extended sideburns using the side of the charcoal in a circular motion. In contrast, the figure\u2019s locks of hair were rendered with long, wavy lines using the tip of the charcoal stick. There are a few areas of smudging of the charcoal along the nose, the bags under the eyes, and the chin, although it is unclear whether this was intentional or rather the unavoidable blending of the media from application. Touches of white chalk were used to highlight areas in the face and on the insect body and wings. The artist used the tip of a thick white chalk to render diagonal and horizontal lines that create tonal effects.\n\nThe composition was drawn directly onto the paper support. There is minor reworking of the figure\u2019s head, the tip of the nose, and the brow line. There are several strokes in these areas that indicate that the artist was reworking the subject\u2019s profile. These areas were built up slightly, and the nose tip has a minor amount of smudging.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in good condition. The sheet has faded overall in the window opening on the recto. There is no fading noted on the verso. The sheet was perimeter mounted to a secondary support with a water-soluble adhesive. Much of the adhesive and paper residues remain on the verso, with a small patch of adhesive on the recto at the center of the bottom edge. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, the adhesive fluoresces pale blue. There are several brown foxing spots throughout the sheet on the recto and verso. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, several foxing spots that were not visible in normal illumination are visible because the paper sizing does not fluoresce. There is a thin band of paper abrasion at the center of the upper edge. There are several tears along the right edge along with another small tear near the top left corner. The tears were repaired using a white Japanese paper with water-soluble adhesive on the verso. There are two areas of paper skinning with associated tears and losses at the bottom edge. The first skinned area is located at the center of the bottom edge, approximately 160 mm from the right edge. The paper was set down and flattened, but the tears were not realigned, leaving visible the blue fibers from the verso. The other area of skinning is much smaller and better realigned. It is located 40 mm from the left edge and 73 mm from the bottom edge. Both skinned areas were reinforced on the verso with a white paper and a water-soluble adhesive. The media are in good condition; there is a vertical band of smudging extending from the center of the subject\u2019s hair down to the legs of the insect body. There is stray black media at the lower left corner.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D515 (ill.); 144, no. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926); see G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
