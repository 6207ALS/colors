    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The exposed wood grain on this tenth century figure reveals that it was carved from the heart of a tree. Like other traditional wood sculptures this originally was painted, the surface still carries traces of white pigment. The figure has a shaved head and sits cross-legged with its right foot resting on his left calf like a Buddha. You might assume that you\u2019re looking at a Buddhist sculpture but this actually represents a deity of Shinto, the native religion of Japan. Until Buddhism arrived in Japan in the mid sixth century, Shinto deities were never depicted in human form. Religious imagery focused on revered places and natural forms. This deity, Hachiman, was a spirit of place that protected Mount Kawara. Copper ore from this mountain was used in creating a bronze Buddha at the Temple of T\u014ddai-ji in the city of Nara. Though the Japanese state had embraced Buddhism imperial officials nevertheless sought the good graces of Hachiman to ensure the safety of their copper supplies. Likewise, the Shinto priests of Hachiman accommodated Buddhism to some degree with figures like this one known as Sogyo Hachiman or Hachiman as a monk.</p>\n",
