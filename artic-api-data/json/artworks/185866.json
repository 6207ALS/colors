    "description": "<p>Julia Fish\u2019s methodical, meditative paintings are abstracted and excerpted from her own personal experiences, memories, and immediate surroundings. Since 1991 she has drawn most often from the architectural elements of her home. \u201cThe house has become a constant companion\u2014in a sense I live inside the subject of my work,\u201d she has said.</p>\n<p>Painted to scale, <em>Entry [Fragment One]</em> depicts a portion of Fish\u2019s tiled entryway at a slight, perspectival angle. She constructed this image of a hand-set tiled surface on a canvas surface with precision, revealing the tensions between border and center, multicolored and white, hexagonal and square. Thus the work establishes an intimate, process-oriented relationship between domestic architecture, which we move through\u2014often unseeing\u2014and painting, which we stop to look at.</p>\n",
