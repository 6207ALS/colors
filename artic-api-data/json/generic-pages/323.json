Block Photography Study Room opened its doors in 1982 when the newly renovated Department of Photography moved into its own facility on the lower level of the museum, adjacent to the photography galleries. With more than 18,000 photographs in the permanent collection, the study room is a valuable resource to learn about photography from its beginnings in the 19th century to contemporary works. The Photography Study Room is available to the public, by appointment only, to view selections from the Art Institute\u2019s photography collection. You may discuss your photography interests with the collection manager at the time an appointment is scheduled. Groups and individuals are welcome. Study room hours are by appointment only. Please send an email at least two weeks in advance to view original photographs. All appointment requests must be made in writing. ",
