    "description": "<p>David Hockney began making photographs in 1970, temporarily abandoning his primary medium of painting to explore the possibilities of what he called joiners, composite images made with multiple photographic prints. His joiners aim to get \u201ccloser to the way that we actually look at things, closer to the truth of experience.\u201d They eschew the single-point perspective of a traditional photograph in favor of an image containing an accumulation of individual perspectives. Depicting the artist in bed\u2014in the act of taking his own image in the facing mirror, surrounded by newspapers and brochures, cigarettes, and the furnishings of his hotel room\u2014this self-portrait shows his morning as a duration instead of a single moment in time.</p>\n",
