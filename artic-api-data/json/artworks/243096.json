    "description": "<p>In the summer of 1965, having graduated two years earlier from the University of Chicago, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/15789/danny-lyon\">Danny Lyon</a> traveled on his Triumph motorcycle from his home in Hyde Park to Chicago\u2019s tough Uptown neighborhood. The area had acquired the nickname Hillbilly Heaven for its large number of immigrants from central Appalachia. Over a period of several months, Lyon photographed residents of Uptown\u2019s Clifton Avenue using a Rolleiflex camera borrowed from his close friend and mentor Hugh Edwards, then a photography curator at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>Lyon gained the trust of several families, resulting in images that depict struggles but also immense community pride: \u201cparadise inside a square,\u201d as the photographer said, referencing the camera\u2019s square format. In 1966 Lyon wrote of the project, \u201cThe pictures are not made to disturb people\u2019s consciences but rather to disturb their consciousness. The pictures do not ask you to \u2018help\u2019 these people, but something much more difficult; to be briefly and intensely aware of their existence, an existence as real and significant as your own.\u201d</p>\n<p>Later in his career, Lyon revisited his earlier negatives to create what he calls montages, alluding to the cinematic use of montage as an editing technique. In 1965 he initially got his subjects\u2019 attention with his Triumph motorcycle, seen in the central self-portrait. The contact prints surrounding this image are examples of the prints Lyon gave on return visits to the individuals he had photographed. In 2008 Lyon received a letter from one subject who had remained in contact with \u201cthe old gang.\u201d \u201cThere are only two groups,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthose that made it out and did well and those that were so addicted and are still over there. . . . It was a sad era in America, but some of us made it out.\u201d</p>\n",
