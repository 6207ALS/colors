    "description": "<p>Elihu Vedder depicted the three Fates of Greek mythology working the thread of life: Clotho spins the thread, Lachesis fixes its length, and Atropos cuts it at the appointed time of death. Their symbolic tools\u2014spindle, distaff, and shears\u2014rest in the foreground, emphasizing the Fates\u2019 decisive role in matters of life and death. Vedder adapted this painting from an illustration he had designed for an 1884 publication by Edward FitzGerald\u2014a translation of the work of 11th-century poet Omar Khayy\u00e1m, <em>The Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t</em>. Vedder was attracted to mysterious, visionary subject matter. Here, he explored metaphysical questions of life, death, and afterlife, subjects at the core of Khayy\u00e1m\u2019s poetry.</p>\n",
