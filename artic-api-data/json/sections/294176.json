The transfer drawing was never put on stone during the artist\u2019s lifetime, but it was eventually transferred and printed by Goulding in 1903 at Birnie Philip\u2019s request. The date and origin of the image have remained elusive because Whistler drew it and put it aside in Paris without ever bringing it to the attention of his cataloguer, T. R. Way. The drawing was made on a commercial grade of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler used in 1891 and 1892 while making color lithographs in Paris with the help of the printer Belfond. It seems likely that A Nude Model Arranging Flowers was drawn during this period of experimentation, perhaps with the idea that it might serve as the keystone for a color lithograph.\n\nThe composition is extremely close to an oil, now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, entitled Nude Girl with Bowl, dated about 1892 (YMSM 400). Whistler also developed the same theme of a young model bending over a bowl or flowerpot in two pastels that may date from roughly the same period, A Nude with a Bowl (M 1394) and A Violet Note (M 1395). The idea that Whistler explored the same subject matter in other color media, namely oil and pastel, makes it all the more plausible that he would have considered a color lithograph of the pose. We know from his early attempts to work on this thin, fragile transfer paper that the artist found it a particularly challenging drawing surface (see cat. 47, cat. 48, cat. 49, and cat. 50), and it is therefore not surprising that he elected not to pursue this slight, spotty drawing.\n\nChicago: SC, ivory laid paper (204 \u00d7 151 mm). Glasgow: HAG (5), on a variety of papers. Washington: NGA, cream laid paper (205 \u00d7 152 mm).  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.

Birnie Philip also assigned the number six to The Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 95).\n\nThe two pastels are now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, and the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. They are not precisely dated, but the latter (M 1395) must be dated to 1894 or earlier, since Whistler sold it to Charles Lang Freer in 1894. Both could be as early as 1892, drawn at about the same time as the oil (YMSM 400).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 57, only state.
