Hubachek, 1946.32  \nGu\u00e9rin 74, Kornfeld 61 C  \nFor the verso, see fig. 112.2.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin carved interchangeable vignettes to accompany the text of his self-published journal, Le sourire (The Smile). In this second-state impression the artist removed a diagonal line above the word Taiti in the upper right corner of the composition. A portion of a tree branch in the lower right corner was removed so that both birds sit on a single branch (fig. 112.2.2). Gauguin also made a small alteration to the shape of the horse\u2019s tail.\n\nThis headpiece appears at the top of the title page of the December 1899 issue of Le sourire (fig. 112.2.3). Gauguin produced nine issues of Le sourire. The December 1899 issue was the fifth and did not contain a supplement. This issue is the first in which Gauguin replaced the word s\u00e9rieux with m\u00e9chant (\u201cwicked\u201d) in the title\n\nGauguin adhered an impression of this print on page 176 of his manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 112.2.4), which suggests that it held particular significance for him.\n\nThis impression was printed in black ink. There are delicate golden-brown halos around the inked lines indicative of an oil medium used to thin the ink. The less-viscous ink could be rolled out more evenly on the block.\n\nGauguin printed this impression on a thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block. The soft, thin Japanese paper was also more conducive to even printing than was noted in the first-state impression (cat. 112.1).\n\n141 \u00d7 221 mm (image); 153 \u00d7 230 mm (sheet)\n\nAt some point a small tear in the upper right was mended with Japanese paper fibers.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper.
