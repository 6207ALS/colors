    "description": "<p>Juan Gris traveled to Paris in 1906 and soon moved to the neighborhood of Montmartre, where he met <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36198\">Pablo Picasso</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33739\">Georges Braque</a>. Eventually, Gris joined their artistic circle and participated in the development of Cubism. In <em>Abstraction (Guitar and Glass)</em>, he incorporated objects often used in Cubist still-life painting\u2014musical instruments, newspaper, a glass, and a tabletop. Rather than shatter their forms, however, Gris took a more synthetic approach to the composition. The overlapping planes, flattened appearance, and rhythmic patterns of the painting reinforce the two-dimensional nature of the picture\u2019s surface, while the trompe l\u2019oeil effects, deeply saturated colors, strong light-dark contrasts, and precise definition of forms give the still life an extraordinary physical reality.</p>\n",
