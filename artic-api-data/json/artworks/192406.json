What's happened to us?\u201d\nShe says with melancholy.\n\nHitler gave us a gift\nAn estate near Poltava,\nIn the shade of an old oak grove\nAnd with lions at the entrance!\n\nMy husband and I, we drove around\nIn a carriage like noble counts\nAnd in our possession, \nWe had two hundred peasant souls!\n\nWe were very pleased\nTo have serfs of our own.\nBut all of them joined the ranks\nOf the Soviet partisans.\n\nEverything ended terribly!\nOn one silent night\nWe had to run away\nFrom the army of the Reds!\n\nWe ran through all the puddles\nNow trotting, now at a gallop.\nAnd my husband and I,\nWe lost our last wardrobe.\n\nAll that remains from our estate \nIs this here bicycle\u2026\nHave pity on us!\nGive us money for a meal.",
