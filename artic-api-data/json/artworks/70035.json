O\u2019Keeffe simplified the energy of the blooming rose to its essence, so that it resembles a brilliant light radiating out of flat Cubist planes. She exhibited this painting as <em>White Rose\u2014Abstraction</em> at Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s Intimate Gallery in 1928 and retitled it <em>Ballet Skirt or Electric Light (from the White Rose Motif)</em> when she lent it to the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s 1943 retrospective of her work.</p>\n",
