    "description": "<p>Tokujin Yoshioka enjoys investigating how traditional materials perform under new circumstances. Honey-Pop is one of the designer\u2019s earliest designs and is self-manufactured. Yoshioka used 120 sheets of glassine (a traditional type of paper for lanterns), glued and then precisely cut, to form each chair. The two-dimensional flat chairs resemble decorations waiting to be opened and gain their three-dimensionality when the layers of paper are unfolded. The honeycomb compositions give the design its strength; there is no other structural framework present. Introducing a degree of personalization into the chair, Yoshioka designed the piece so that the final form is determined when the user sits on it, his or her imprint creating the seat.</p>\n",
