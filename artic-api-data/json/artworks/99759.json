Albright\u2019s haunting portrayal of his father powerfully conveys a sense of the artist\u2019s fingers as they molded the planes of the face, creating an almost grotesque physicality of form. He also left the head incomplete, heightening the dramatic effect of the sculpture. According to Albright, his father\u2014an artist known for his Impressionist style\u2014was infuriated by the unconventional portrait, which only pleased his boldly nonconformist son.</p>\n",
