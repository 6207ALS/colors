    "copy": " This dramatic canvas was painted by Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco during his self-imposed exile in the United States. A leader of the Mexican Mural movement of the 1920s and 1930s, Orozco painted Emiliano Zapata who had become a symbol of the Mexican Revolution (1910-20) after his assassination in 1919. This resource packet focuses on a single work of art from the museum's collection and provides information about the artwork, the artist, and the historical context of the piece. ",
