    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: Although at the end of life, Monet spent most of his time in Giverny painting the hillsides and the famous water lily pond, he did take trips away. And one of the trips he continued to take, starting in 1900, was to London.<br>Narrator: There Monet developed a series of paintings based on the River Thames. This one depicts the Houses of Parliament veiled in fog.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And he loved London\u2019s atmosphere, because, well, when he went during the winter months it was normally gray and chilly and had moisture in the air and he loved the fog. He loved this idea of this grayness, this heaviness, and he\u2019s working with a building that represents the government, the Houses of Parliament. And yet he\u2019s dissolving it just like he would dissolve nature, that atmospheric effect that changes whatever it is permeating.<br>Narrator: Monet\u2019s soft brush strokes and rich blue-purple colors transform the venerable Neo-Gothic buildings. The towers and pentacles silhouetted against the fiery tones of the setting sun seem dramatically lengthened by the soft light filtering through the foggy haze giving them a sense of poetry and mystery.</p>\n",
