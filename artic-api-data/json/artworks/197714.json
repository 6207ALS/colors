    "description": "<p>Giles Grendey was a cabinetmaker and timber merchant with workshops near St. Paul\u2019s, London. Unusually for an English cabinetmaker of his time, he had a broad international clientele: a fire that struck his premises in August 1731 destroyed over \u00a31000 worth of furniture (approximately $37,000 in today\u2019s currency) described as \u201cpack\u2019d for Exportation against the next morning.\u201d In fact, Grendey\u2019s most famous commission came from a Spanish client, the Duke of Infantado, for whose castle at Lazcano in northern Spain he supplied a suite of over seventy-seven pieces of furniture in the late 1730s. This cabinet is decorated in a style similar to the Infantado suite, in red and gold japanning, the English name for imitation lacquer.</p>\n<p>The cabinet combines some classical elements, like the broken pediment and flame-like finials at the top, with chinoiserie (Chinese-inspired) figures and scenes done in gold and silver. On the interior doors, a lady holding a branch faces a warrior holding a banner. The slope front is richly decorated with figures riding in a chariot, while others lounge in summer pavilions. The drawers and slides display landscapes with horsemen and other figures, birds, and foliage.</p>\n<p>\u2014 About This Object, European Decorative Arts LaunchPad app</p>\n",
