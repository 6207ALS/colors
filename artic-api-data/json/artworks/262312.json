    "description": "<p>Correspondence, photographs, printed matter, and research notes gathered or produced by Barbara Bernstein for a grant-funded film entitled \u201cSilver Lining\u201d and a related but presumably unpublished typescript. Bernstein\u2019s aim was \u201cto make available to the public a whole era\u2019s worth of good and valuable art that for a long time [was] inaccessible, not so much lost as unidentified.\u201d Bernstein sought works created not only through the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project, but also those sponsored or funded by lesser known New Deal art programs such the PWAP (Public Works of Art Program), the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture (later, Treasury Section of Fine Arts), and The Treasury Relief Art Project. The scope of Bernstein\u2019s research encompassed only surviving, large-scale works of New Deal art in public places in Illinois, including those found de-installed but in storage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/New%20Deal%20Federal%20Art%20Project%20Research%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
