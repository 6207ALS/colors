Like the other images in this group, Mother and Child, No. 4 must have been drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal sometime in 1891, when Whistler was beginning a collaboration with the French printer Belfond. The drawing was then set aside with cats. 51\u201353 and not transferred to stone until Whistler consigned the whole group to the Ways for printing in 1895. As he often did, the artist made several variations on this composition, notably an untransferred lithographic drawing, Mother and Child, No. 6 (dwg. IV), and an etching, Cameo, No. 1 (Mother and Child) (K 347).\n\nWhen Whistler drew Mother and Child, No. 4, he tried out his crayon in the lower left corner of the sheet. These marks as well as a few stray lines in the baby\u2019s right cheek and behind her head were never cleaned off the stone. A few additional lines were drawn directly on the stone to clarify the position of the model\u2019s breasts beneath her transparent garments. No further changes were made, and it seems likely that both artist and printers were displeased with the uneven effects achieved in the few impressions that were pulled; some of the most delicate lines appear dry and insufficiently inked, while the dark shadows behind the mother\u2019s back printed too heavily. At the time of Whistler\u2019s death, there were no impressions of this rare image remaining in his estate.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory Japanese paper (222 \u00d7 290 mm), signed; MWC, cream Japanese paper (222 \u00d7 289 mm), signed.
