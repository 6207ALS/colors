Mulliner in 1912, and the mural decoration removed in 1919 in preparation for demolition of the house, which took place in 1923 [Sheppard 1966, vol. 33, pp. 223-24]; acquired with most of the interior fittings of the house by Monday, Kern, and Herbert, London, 1919 [see the Times (London), 1919].  W. and J. Sloane and Co., New York, by 1921, to 1925 [W. and J. Sloane 1921 and de Brie 1925]; bought by Mr. and Mrs. Richard T. Crane, together with many fittings of the house, 1925; given to the Art Institute, 1925 (the staircase, installed at the Art Institute without the murals in the late 1940s, was sold at Sotheby\u2019s, New York, October 18, 1997, no. 391).",
