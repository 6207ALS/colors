A.D. 81\u201396) assumed the title Germanicus (conqueror of Germany)\u2014apparently without the Senate\u2019s intervention\u2014from A.D. 83, after he personally undertook two campaigns in the Black Forest region. This title conjured memories of the ever-popular Germanicus (d. A.D. 9) and the Julio-Claudian family, to whom Domitian liked to compare himself; he even affected to wear the purple cloak of a triumphant general, as Julius Caesar had done. This coin records that he held the consulship for the fifteenth time. Domitian was already consul for the seventh time by the time his brother Titus died in A.D. 81, though at least the first six were merely honorary or \u201csuffect\u201d consulships reflecting the relative lack of responsibility he was allowed during the reigns of his brother and his father, Vespasian. His own reign continued the effective but autocratic policies of his brother and father, but without their tactful attitude toward the Senate, which explains the negative assessment of his reign in the contemporary literature.\n\nThe weight of this coin reflects Domitian\u2019s A.D. 82 reform of the gold and silver coinage, which he wished to restore to Augustan standards. Though it falls short of that, it is a significant revaluation to pre\u2013Great Fire levels. Within two years the weight standard faltered again, as the treasury could not provide enough precious metals, but remained higher than under his father\u2019s reign.\n\nThe reform of the coinage was accompanied by a new series of reverses dedicated to Domitian\u2019s patron goddess, Minerva. Suetonius tells us that Domitian\u2019s attachment to the goddess verged on \u201csuperstitious veneration\u201d; Philostratus gives evidence that Domitian wanted to be known as the \u201cson of Minerva.\u201d Certainly the establishment of a literary contest (the Quinquatria) honoring Minerva, the restoration or building of three temples, and the founding of a college of priests in her honor indicate the scope of his veneration. The \u201cCancellaria\u201d reliefs, probably depicting Domitian\u2019s departure for the war in Sarmatia in 92, show Minerva gazing steadily into the eyes of Domitian (see fig. 45.1). The four Minerva reverse types that dominated the coinage from this point depicted her as protector of the fleets, as patroness of the arts, as Jupiter\u2019s second-in-command, and as Rome\u2019s and Domitian\u2019s protectress, as on this coin. The figure is modeled on the famous Athena Promachos sculpted by Phidias for the Acropolis in Athens, which was very influential (fig. 45.2). At about the same time this series of coins was initiated, Domitian also established a legion under Minerva\u2019s name, which lasted until the fourth century.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Jones, Emperor Domitian, pp. 28\u201329.\n\nFor example, cat. 39, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nero, at 7.70 grams (prereform), and cat. 40, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nero, at 7.27 grams (postreform).
