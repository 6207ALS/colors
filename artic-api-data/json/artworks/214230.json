    "description": "<p>Hunter Reynolds is among a group of contemporary queer artists who confront the immensity of the AIDS crisis. HIV-positive for three decades, he has explored art as a healing mechanism by employing performance, sculpture, photography, and collage. Here, Reynolds stitched together photographically reproduced newspaper articles from the 1980s on AIDS and gay culture; over this he superimposed images from his earlier works <em>Blood Spots</em>, installations with enlargements of his own blood dropping onto paper, and the <em>Mummification</em> performances, in which he was wrapped with cellophane and tape and left to rest for hours only to later emerge from the mummy skin in a gesture of transformation and resurrection. Although his own body is his primary medium, photography has proven an ideal handmaiden for Reynolds to stitch together memory, loss, resistance, and survival.</p>\n",
