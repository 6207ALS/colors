In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were exhibited in Paris at Galeries Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 53.1, fig. 53.2, and fig. 53.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, the artist could select motifs from the array of works he had accumulated. Displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, they formed a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, Gauguin\u2019s encounter with the South Seas, where he\u2014always the outsider\u2014felt, at least some of the time, that he had found a home. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa Suite received two printings during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in c. 1894 by his friend Louis Roy\u2014and one key printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s son Pola supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. However, Pola Gauguin was unable to pull an impression of Te atua (The God) because his father had recycled the image\u2019s boxwood matrix, using the reverse to execute two other prints. Thus the following description of the print\u2019s components is based on impressions the artist made (cats. 53.1\u20134). Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nTe atua, the third print in the Noa Noa Suite, moves the viewer from the realm of mortals to that of the gods who created them and determined their fate. The wood-block print features Polynesian deities who appear in much the same way in woodcarvings Gauguin made in Tahiti as early as 1892 (figs. 53.9, 53.12, 53.17, and 53.29). So close to one another are the images in Te atua and the carvings that the former seems to be a flattened version of the latter, as if the artist had produced the print by combining \u201crubbings\u201d he made of the sculptures. If one joins the print\u2019s left and right sides to form a cylinder, one can see clearly its relationship to the artist\u2019s carvings (see fig. 53.4). The print\u2019s components would continue to figure in Gauguin\u2019s work in a variety of mediums and contexts throughout the remainder of his career.\n\nThe deities portrayed at the left are Hina (spirit of the moon) and Tefatu (spirit of the earth). Clad in pareus (wrap-around skirts), they are engaged in an intense dialogue about the eternity of matter. At the image\u2019s center, the hieratic figure of Ta\u2019aroa (creator god of the Polynesian universe and supreme deity), sits, Buddha-like, in meditation. His right hand rests in his lap, and his left touches the earth, a mudra signaling the moment of the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment. Because of the printing process, this iconic pose reverses the traditional one, which permeates Buddhist art. At the right is another representation of Hina, accompanied by Ta\u2019aroa, who is reduced here to a tiny, gnome-like figure crouching on bent knee below the arrowhead-shaped leaf of an ape plant (see fig. 53.5). In some versions of the Polynesian creation myth, Hina is the spouse of Ta\u2019aroa, and Tefatu is their child. The plate\u2019s title, \u201cTe Atua,\u201d appears in the top center; Gauguin\u2019s monogram, PGo, is set within a lunette shape at the lower left.\n\nThe striated patterns that swirl over the deities suggest a meteor shower, much like the agitated sky in The Starry Night (fig. 53.6) by Vincent van Gogh, Gauguin\u2019s host and studio companion in Arles, in the south of France, for two months in late 1888. But these forms most likely represent the blossoms, leaves, and stems of the peacock flower (see Scented Sites, fig. 9, and cat. 56), which Gauguin depicted in his 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (fig. 53.7).\n\nThe shrubs between the deities, as well as the rodent-like animal in front of the central figure of Ta\u2019aroa, were inspired by similar images in the two albumen prints of Borobudur by Isidore van Kinsbergen that Gauguin owned and took with him to Tahiti (see fig. 53.8).\n\nSilhouetted dramatically against the moon, the figures of Hina and Tefatu are based on a linga-like, tamanu wood sculpture, Hina and Fatu (Hina and Tefatu), which Gauguin executed in 1892 (fig. 53.9). References to these two deities, to whom the artist was clearly drawn, abound in his graphic work.\n\nAmong the many images of Hina and Tefatu that relate directly to Te atua is one\u2014Parau Hina Tefatou (Hina Addressing Tefatu)\u2014that Gauguin selected as the frontispiece of the catalogue for his Durand-Ruel exhibition (fig. 53.10). The now-lost pen-and-ink drawing used for the photomechanical reproduction relates directly to the above-mentioned tamanu sculpture, including the tattoos on Hina\u2019s face.\n\nA sheet featuring several sketches (fig. 53.11 left) includes one of Hina, after a tamanu sculpture, Hina with Two Attendants (fig. 53.12). As in the sculpture, Hina bends her elbows to raise her forearms; in the print, her arms hang alongside her body. The sketch of Hina and Tefatu, which is squared off, was an idea for a painting or an illustration. Tefatu, who wears a pareu, and Hina, who is naked, crouch along a shore: Gauguin\u2019s hallmark patterned water can be seen in the foreground. Behind Tefatu one discerns the faint outline of a tupapau (a spirit of the dead) and indications of a landscape setting. The sketch is closely linked to both the sculpture Hina and Fatu and Te atua, as can be seen if one reverses the drawing (fig. 53.11 right). However, several variations and the details included in the foreground and background suggest that is not a preparatory drawing for Te atua. It could reflect an idea for an illustration for the commercial edition of Noa Noa that Gauguin subsequently rejected. In 1894 he produced eleven pen, brush, and ink drawings for the publication, each intended to introduce a chapter in the text. One of these drawings (fig. 53.13 [cat. 63]) closely resembles the print and related sculpture. Hina appears here naked and, as in the sculpture, bears tattoos around her eyes and on her abdomen; Tefatu, again with a moustache and goatee, is dressed in a pareu. They are silhouetted against a dark, globe-like form representing the earth and a lighter crescent moon; at the upper left are the words Parau Hina Tefatou (Hina addressing Tefatu).\n\nIn an 1894 watercolor entitled Pape Moe, Parau Hina Tefatou (Mysterious Water, Hina Addressing Tefatu) (fig. 53.14), Hina and Tefatu\u2019s heads and shoulders, seen against a white sphere, seem to float above a waterfall. A Tahitian (a girl, according to Gauguin) leans over a rock to take a drink of water. The left half of the sphere\u2019s outline, behind Hina, is dark, signifying night. At the upper right is an inscription\u2014\u201cQu\u2019importe la source / Si l\u2019eau est d\u00e9licieuse\u201d (Never mind the source / If the water is delicious).\n\nThe couple appears again on a ceramic vase (fig. 53.15) from 1893/95. Later Gauguin pasted a hand-colored fragment of Hina and Tefatu, which he had cut from an impression of an early state of Te atua, onto page 57 of his 1893\u20131901 bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 53.16).\n\nThe central image of Ta\u2019aroa is a two-dimensional version of a tamanu sculpture, Tii with a Pearl, which Gauguin executed in Tahiti in 1892 (fig. 53.17). The pearl that adorns the carved figure\u2019s hair and the mother-of-pearl oyster shell in which he sits are attributes of the creator god. According to the Polynesian creation myth, Ta\u2019aroa was confined within a shell that he broke out of in order to create the universe. This narrative evokes the cosmic-egg mythology common to a number of early civilizations worldwide. Ta\u2019aroa\u2019s pose derives from that of a statue of Vishnu featured in a photograph that the artist owned from a volume of the antiquities of Java by Van Kinsbergen (fig. 53.18).\n\nThe right portion of Te atua contains the figures of Hina and Ta\u2019aroa. Like the other two sections of the print, Hina is a quotation from an 1892 tamanu sculpture (fig. 53.12). Realized summarily, the small personage beside Hina can be seen clearly only in impressions of the first state of the print (fig. 53.19). Those of subsequent states obscure the legibility of the figure, which seems to blend with the vegetation surrounding it. Nonetheless, the figure can be identified as Ta\u2019aroa by comparing it with a very similar representation in a later painting by Gauguin, Savage Poems (fig. 53.20). Images of Ta\u2019aroa and Hina together can be found in other contemporary works by Gauguin. In a line drawing in the artist\u2019s 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion), we find the deities\u2014their genitalia prominently displayed\u2014about to engage in sex (fig. 53.21). Ta\u2019aroa\u2019s face is enhanced by tattoo-like Marquesan patterns that underscore the ovoid shape of his eyes; seen from behind, Hina shows us her face in profile.\n\nRenderings of Ta\u2019aroa in various guises can be found in Ancien culte mahorie. One watercolor (fig. 53.22) shows a sexually aroused Ta\u2019aroa\u2014his face mask-like and his hair long and flowing\u2014seated with bent knees after having created the Polynesian universe. His prominent hands and feet resemble those of Marquesan tikis. The illustration on page 14 depicts only Ta\u2019aroa\u2019s countenance, a mask with large, ovoid eyes at the center of a decorative setting referencing symbolic aspects of the creation of the universe (fig. 53.23). The features of his face here relate closely to those of the small idol in Savage Poems.\n\nOne of Van Kinsbergen\u2019s photographs (fig. 53.24) provides the source for the tiny figure\u2019s stance\u2014a one-legged squat. In the Borobudur relief, three similar figures\u2014attendants to Shiva known as ganas\u2014support Buddha on his throne. Ganas are typically shown squatting under the weight they carry. That Gauguin derived pleasure from depicting these creatures is evident from their presence in several later works. One is the humorous send-up of a Tahitian meal, Repas de Tahiti (A Tahitian Meal) (fig. 53.25), in which a yellow pig is served on a native dish, known as an umete, that is supported by ganas. They appear again in the masthead for his four-page broadsheet Le sourire (The Smile), dating from 1899/1900 (see fig. 53.26).\n\nThe ceramic vase featuring Tefatu mentioned above also includes an image of Hina (fig. 53.27). She is represented as well in three drawings (fig. 53.28, fig. 53.29, and fig. 53.30 [Rewald 87]) intended for the commercial edition of Noa Noa, which in turn relates closely to a watercolor-transfer monotype (fig. 53.31). Gauguin depicted Hina with her arms alongside her body for the last time in a series of small wood-block prints he executed before leaving France for Tahiti in March 1895 (see fig. 53.32 [cat. 82.3]). At a later date, he pasted a hand-colored fragment showing Hina, cut from an impression of the earliest-known state of Te atua, onto page 59 of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 53.33).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The title of this print means \u201cThe God,\u201d but it has also been translated as \u201cThe Gods,\u201d understandably, given the plurality of figures represented. It is inscribed at the top of the image in the middle, possibly indicating that it refers especially to the central figure, and the letters are lowercase with the exception of the initial of the word atua, a choice that\u2014without implying a monotheistic conception\u2014is consistent with the idea of a supreme being. In any case, the title positions the plate in the mythological realm and promises a representation of the divine according to Polynesian conceptions.\n\nNo other inscription on this plate gives a name to the figures, however, so that the identification must rest on their appearance and attributes, and even more on Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa text and the works he had realized during his 1891\u201393 stay in Tahiti. For the viewer uninformed about such parallels and antecedents, the image\u2019s protagonists\u2014from left to right\u2014present as a couple engaged in an intimate interaction, a seated Buddha-like figure in meditation, and a female cult figure. This impression, while it may be complemented and challenged by additional knowledge, retains its relevance insofar as Gauguin intended his works to possess a high degree of autonomy and trusted means of expression such as line, color, light, and shade to communicate directly to the mind through the senses.\n\nCommentators on the print have generally agreed on identifying the dramatis personae as, respectively, Hina and Tefatu, Ta\u2018aroa, and again Hina. Peter Zegers recapitulates the corresponding arguments, including comparisons with Gauguin\u2019s earlier works, and adds a fifth character, a tiny and barely visible Ta\u2018aroa in a squatting position at the extreme right (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). The only point of contention has been the central figure, which Stephen Eisenman described as Buddha. Zegers bases his identification on the sculpture Tii with a Pearl (fig. 53.34 [Gray 94]). This identification can be further supported by Tii with a Shell (fig. 53.35 [Gray 99]), to the extent that the latter displays a more \u201cprimitive\u201d aspect and insofar as the mother-of-pearl aureole can be seen as an attribute of Ta\u2018aroa. Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an, Gauguin\u2019s main source regarding ancient Polynesian culture, quotes an oral account of the creation of the world and of the gods, which the artist copied at the beginning of his 1893 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion). According to this narrative, Ta\u2018aroa \u201cturns himself into the universe,\u201d and the universe becomes \u201cthe shell of Ta\u2018aroa.\u201d The slightly horseshoe-shaped aureole around the central figure in Te atua is reminiscent of a shell. This suffices to connect it with Ta\u2018aroa, but not in an exclusive way. The formal models for this figure can be found in two Asian statues of which Gauguin possessed photographs, one of Buddha resisting the assault of Mara on a frieze of the temple of Borobudur (fig. 53.36) and the other of Vishnu in Wonosobo, Java (fig. 53.37). It therefore seems logical to assume that Gauguin conflated in his figure Ta\u2018aroa, Buddha, and possibly Vishnu as well. Jehanne Teilhet-Fisk similarly concluded from her analysis of Tii with a Shell and Tii with a Pearl that they incorporate \u201cthe idea that theosophically Ta\u2018aroa and Buddha are one and the same.\u201d\n\nOn the left, the close encounter between Hina and Tefatu refers to a dialogue transcribed by Moerenhout under the title \u201cEternity of Matter,\u201d which Gauguin had copied and illustrated in Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 53.38). According to this legend, Hina, as the \u201cgenius\u201d or goddess of the moon, asks the \u201cgenius\u201d or god of the earth Tefatu to grant humans a new life after death, but he refuses and decides that they must die and perish like plants and the earth itself, whereas Hina lets the moon and what it contains live again. While in the Ancien culte mahorie watercolor, the two figures are shown as equal and complementary partners, Tefatu appears dominant in Te atua and Hina\u2019s gesture suggests she is pleading. Teilhet-Fisk remarked that, in comparison with his source, Gauguin increased the importance of Tefatu, and she supposed that the artist was thereby \u201cperhaps consciously imposing the Christian concept of the Trinity on the Tahitian pantheon.\u201d The importance of this scene for Gauguin is emphasized in Te atua by the placement of his monogram PGO just beneath it, in the lower-left corner of the print.\n\nGauguin visualized the tense dialogue related by Moerenhout in a form that can suggest an amorous encounter, a reading also made possible in other versions, such as the painting Hina Tefatou (fig. 53.39 [W 499]). It is possible that he connected the Polynesian legend with the biblical account of the Original Sin and of the ensuing Fall, which also condemned humankind to mortality. In the Getty draft manuscript of Noa Noa, Gauguin planned to introduce the Tefatu legend after a description of the painting Pape moe (fig. 53.40 [W 498]) and in a watercolor version of the same theme (fig. 53.41), a vignette with the heads of Hina and Tefatu appears above the spring of water from which the figure is about to drink, accompanied by a motto suggesting a temptation scene: \u201cQu\u2019importe la source / Si l\u2019eau est d\u00e9licieuse\u201d (\u201cNever mind the source, as long as the water is delicious\u201d).\n\nAt the right side of the print, the standing Hina has the hieratic appearance of a cult image. Her oversized head and almond-shaped eyes correspond to Polynesian anthropomorphic sculptures, while the greater anatomical realism and her elaborate headdress call to mind Asian prototypes, such as statues of Shiva\u2019s consort P\u0101rvat\u012b. The diminutive Ta\u2018aroa accompanying Hina suggests that she appears here as his wife: Moerenhout attributed to them numerous children named \u201ctiis\u201d (ti\u2019ii in Tahitian, tiki in Marquesan), described as \u201cspirits inferior to the gods.\u201d The standing Hina is one of the two types\u2014the other being seated (see cat. 55, Commentary)\u2014that Gauguin used when visualizing a large \u201cidol\u201d worshipped in pre-Christian times, for instance in Mahana no te atua (Day of the God) (fig. 53.42 [cat. 72] [W 513]), which he painted in France while working on Noa Noa. In effect, the attendants of these imaginative re-creations of the past are generally female, like the goddess herself, clearly contradicting Moerenhout\u2019s text, which mentions that women were regarded as impure and prohibited from entering all marae (places of worship), including the small domestic ones possessed by most families. It is therefore poetic license, consistent with Gauguin\u2019s valorization of Hina, to whom he seems to have given greater importance than did all recorded missionaries and ethnologists. This may be related to the egalitarian bent of his opinion about the sexes, which he partly inherited from his maternal grandmother, the utopian feminist Flora Tristan. Or it may be connected to the notion, expressed with a misogynist undertone by Charles Morice in his introduction to the 1901 edition of Noa Noa, that women were especially fond of Hina and that their devotion resulted, like the legend of the goddess\u2019s plea for humankind, from the missionaries\u2019 enervating influence.\n\nGauguin had also read in Moerenhout\u2019s account that ancient Polynesians did not make anthropomorphic images of their higher deities, such as Ta\u2018aroa, whose \u201ctrue emblems\u201d were the to\u02bbo (see fig. 53.43), long pieces of hollowed-out wood covered in an envelope woven of coconut-palm fiber and sometimes containing red feathers, hair, or teeth. He knew that the images placed in the marae were those of the inferior ti\u2019is and, accordingly, referred to the sculptures included in his 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel, in Paris, as \u201cLes Tiis\u201d in the catalogue. Why did he choose then to represent in Te atua\u2014as in some of his paintings and sculptures\u2014the higher gods mentioned by Moerenhout in a more or less abstracted human form inspired by Indian and Southeast Asian prototypes? One reason may be that, although he was remarkably open to non-Western traditions himself, as his close study of and borrowing from Marquesan art testify, he was also aware that the common response to such forms would be of the kind demonstrated by Moerenhout, who introduced the to\u02bbo by saying that, \u201cas art, nothing more ridiculous and crude could be imagined.\u201d Another reason may be the comparative, syncretic, and universalist viewpoint underlying his approach of Polynesian religion and mythology. Teilhet-Fisk compared Gauguin\u2019s conflation of Ta\u2018aroa and Buddha in Tii with a Shell and Tii with a Pearl with the theosophical writings of Madame (Helena) Blavatsky, which he must have known of through his friends \u00c9mile Schuffenecker and Paul S\u00e9rusier. Another source or model could have been \u00c9douard Schur\u00e9\u2019s Grands initi\u00e9s of 1889, which was very popular among Parisian Symbolist circles and whose program is summarized by its subtitle: Esquisse de l\u2019histoire secr\u00e8te des religions. Rama, Krishna, Herm\u00e8s, Orph\u00e9e, Pythagore, Platon, J\u00e9sus.\n\nTe atua has the sculptural and architectural appearance of a frieze carved in relief, or of statues positioned in niches side by side, like the two giant representations of Buddha that once stood in indentations in the cliffs of the Bamiyan Valley in Afghanistan (fig. 53.44). From this point of view, it is the print most closely resembling the Borobudur reliefs (see fig. 53.36) that partly inspired the Noa Noa Suite, and it is most strongly reminiscent of the rubbings and paper squeeze-molds taken from monuments around the world (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). Should it be regarded as a Tahitian pantheon according to Gauguin after Moerenhout and a \u201csort of Trinity of Polynesian supernatural powers\u201d? This hypothesis seems logical and is supported by the recapitulative quality of the print, in relation to the sculptures that informed it. But it is partly contradicted by the repetition of figures (Ta\u2018aroa and Hina appearing twice) and by the narrative character of the scene on the left. Although the existence of an iconographic program is improbable, one can attempt to understand how Gauguin articulated the various elements.\n\nThe directions of the arcs passing above the lateral groups, in which Zegers sees peacock flowers or meteor showers (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), converge toward the seated figure and further emphasize its centrality. The gesture of this figure is the Bh\u016bmispars\u00e1mudr\u0101, by which Buddha calls the earth goddess to witness that he has resisted the tempter M\u0101ra and achieved enlightenment. If the dialogue between Hina and Tefatu is connected to the biblical Fall, by which humankind was condemned to mortality, then a parallel can also be drawn between the Buddha\u2019s illumination and the figure of Christ as redeemer. The small tree positioned between the two groups, which also derives from reliefs at Borobudur (see fig. 53.8), could stand both for the Christian tree of the knowledge of good and evil and for the Bodhi Tree, the Ficus religiosa under which Siddhartha Gautama became Buddha; its shape is triangular and in the two impressions printed by Louis Roy under Gauguin\u2019s guidance (see cat. 53.6), this tree is lighter than the rest of the plate, like the two aureoles.\n\nThe long hair and small breasts of the central figure qualify it as androgynous, a state that Gauguin\u2014in accordance with many fin-de-si\u00e8cle authors\u2014regarded as superior. The respective genders of Hina and Tefatu, on the contrary, are clearly indicated. One could imagine that the enlightenment or salvation reached by the Ta\u2018aroa/Vishnu/Buddha/Christ figure implies a renunciation of the sexual difference, but this is not plausible in the context of Gauguin\u2019s thought and of Polynesian cosmogony. With one hand on the small Ta\u2018aroa and one hand on another plant, round in shape and containing in its middle a form that resembles an open grenade, the standing Hina clearly denotes fecundity. Two broad serpentine lines surrounding her and the shrub come together to the left of the seated figure, after supporting his legs and being touched by his downward hand. Proceeding along, the line bends as if to avoid a mongoose-like animal below it and stops just before the trunk of the triangular tree, assuming a curious shape (fig. 53.45) that has not been identified. It calls to mind Marquesan motifs that fascinated Gauguin, and it can be compared with one of the most commonly used, the ipu (container), found on tattoos, war clubs, other wood carvings (see fig. 53.46), and on the tortoiseshell plaques of headdresses. Whatever its source, the most striking aspect of this motif is its reversible character, which makes the perception oscillate between a light shape on a dark ground and the opposite. In a similar way, in 1892 Gauguin had selected a Marquesan ear ornament (taiana), including a reversible figure/ground element as a model for the freely invented fence surrounding a sacred precinct in his 1892 painting Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (fig. 53.47 [W 483]; see cat. 41), and a study of this motif included a figure of Buddha (fig. 53.48).\n\nIn Parahi te marae, the reversible motif can be associated with the relationship between the lingam and the yoni, the abstract image of Shiva as the male organ of generation and its vaginal counterpart. In Te atua, the motif of the lingam is indirectly present with the standing Hina, whose outline corresponds to the shape of the eponymous sculpture (see fig. 53.49), included in the 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel and that magnifies the phallic shape common to all cylindrical sculptures by Gauguin. The same connection may therefore be relevant in Te atua, and the curved line moving from Hina to the seated figure could represent the process of generation allowing the sub-lunar world to surmount mortality, as well as a conjunctio oppositorum corresponding to the moment of \u201cenlightenment.\u201d This would agree with Moerenhout\u2019s understanding of the Polynesian religion as \u201cadoration of the forces of nature,\u201d duly copied by Gauguin: according to which Ta\u2018aroa and Hina were the names given to the two principles\u2014respectively male and female, active and passive, spiritual and material, invisible and visible\u2014composing the universe and united in God.\n\nIf this interpretation is correct, Gauguin was not content with \u201ctranslating\u201d Moerenhout\u2019s Polynesian cosmogony into an anthropomorphic pantheon compatible with Christian, Hindu, and Buddhist iconographic traditions, but rather wished to include as well aniconic elements partly inspired by Marquesan art. The same could be said of color. The theme of divinity and \u201cenlightenment\u201d gives a special meaning to the importance of chiaroscuro in this print, and the various impressions pulled by Gauguin can be seen as exercises in expressing the numinous, with a paradoxical climax reached in the one almost devoid of ink and purely embossed (cat. 53.2). Similarly, the choice of yellow and red, the latter especially for Louis Roy\u2019s edition (see cat. 53.6), is consistent with the sacredness of these colors reported by Moerenhout. Although the print, with its haptic qualities and its derivation from sculptures, makes no secret of showing us not the gods but rather images of images of the gods, it is efficient at endowing these images with presence, and the title Te atua may after all evoke the divine rather than any specific deity.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Louis Roy printed this impression in spring\u2013summer 1894 in an edition of about twenty-five impressions.\n\nLouis Roy printed this impression in spring\u2013summer 1894 in an edition of about twenty-five impressions.\n\nIn the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends).

With its giant leaves, which point up, the plant can reach heights of ten to twelve feet. It is not to be confused with the taro plant (genus: Colocasia; species: C. esculenta), whose leaves point down.\n\nThe serpentine line extending in front of Ta\u2019aroa has been identified as a pandanus leaf. See Mary Lynn Zink, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2019s Ta\u2019aroa, the Tahitian God of Creation\u201d (Ph.D. diss., University of California at Santa Barbara, 1976), p. 61.\n\nTamanu (Alexandrian laurel); Calophyllum inophyllum. Another Tahitian name for this wood is ati.\n\nAll but two relate directly to the sculpture and its two-dimensional counterpart, Te atua. The two exceptions are found in Gauguin\u2019s reflections on the Polynesian creation myth, which he recorded in Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) based on information that he had culled selectively from an 1837 travel account: Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertand, 1837), vol. 1, chap. 2, pp. 416\u2013569. The first, on page 7, depicts the couple: Tefatu, who sports a moustache and goatee, and Hina. The second, on page 13, shows Hina and Tefatu seated on the ground and conversing.\n\nBoth illustrations include imagery closely related to Marquesan carvings. In the first, for example, Tefatu resembles an ancient tiki (a large figure carved out of wood or volcanic rock). In the second, the stylization of the figures\u2019 hands and feet are informed by Marquesan precedents. Gauguin reprised this subject again in a watercolor illustration on page 55 of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti.\n\nGaleries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Paul Gauguin (Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893).

Amishai-Maisels, however, thought that Gauguin carved Tii with a Shell before reading Moerenhout, used a shell \u201cfor primitivizing reasons,\u201d and reinterpreted it as \u201cthe Universe-Shell of Taaroa\u201d after discovering Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an. This chronology of the events was rejected by Jehanne Teilhet-Fisk in Paradise Reviewed: An Interpretation of Gauguin\u2019s Polynesian Symbolism (UMI Research Press, 1983), p. 49. Moerenhout had translated his Tahitian source somewhat tentatively by writing that \u201cthe universe is only the body or the shell of Taaroa,\u201d observing that the word paa meant principally an \u201cegg\u201d but could sometimes refer to \u201cthe body or the exterior parts of an object\u201d; Moerenhout, Voyages, vol. 1, p. 421. Gauguin, however, only retained \u201cthe shell.\u201d Teilhet-Fisk quoted another source and observed that \u201cthe legend of Ta\u2019aroa always begins with him sitting in his shell\u201d (p. 51). The cosmogenesis and theogenesis transmitted by Moerenhout had rapidly become famous and was the basis for Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle\u2019s poem \u201cLa Gen\u00e8se polyn\u00e9sienne\u201d (\u201cThe Polynesian Genesis\u201d), included in his 1862 collection Po\u00e8mes barbares.

Ziva Amishai-Maisels believed that Gauguin was especially attracted to this statue (which she identified as depicting Shiva and as coming from Dieng in Java) \u201cbecause of its androgynous form\u201d; Amishai-Maisels, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Early Tahitian Idols,\u201d Art Bulletin 40, no. 2 (June 1978), p. 339.\n\nA similar plant stands between Eve and the serpent in Gauguin\u2019s 1890 painting Exotic Eve (Pola Museum of Art, Hakone, Japan [W 389]).\n\nMary Lynn Zink identified it as a pandanus leaf, but this is not convincing; Zink, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2019s Ta\u2019aroa, the Tahitian God of Creation\u201d (Ph.D. diss., University of California at Santa Barbara, 1976), p. 61.\n\nSee Karl von den Steinen, Les marquisiens et leur art, trans. from German by Helma Arcosanzo (German ed. 1925\u201328; Mus\u00e9e de Tahiti et des \u00celes, 2005), vol. 1, pp. 163\u201364. According to Steinen, the ipu motif derives from the upper part (hands and arms) of the etua (human body) motif. Gauguin was familiar with Marquesan motifs from tattoos in particular.
