His reason, as he explained to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, was that he was \u201ccertain never to find . . . so beautiful a region.\u201d A long-time gardening enthusiast, Monet set about renovating the grounds, carefully supplementing the flower beds with plantings so that the gardens would be in bloom all season long. In February 1893, the artist acquired additional land across the train tracks at the south end of the property, where he envisioned adding a water garden. He applied for permission to divert water from a branch of the Epte River for a pond and to build two bridges. In spite of local concern over his proposal, by July Monet received the necessary permits to proceed with his project, and within a few months the thousand-square-meter pond and a Japanese-inspired wooden bridge were completed (fig. 37.1).\n\nIn his application to the Eure department prefect, Monet had argued that a water garden would be \u201cagreeable and for the pleasure of the eyes,\u201d but he offered another reason as well, that he intended to mine the picturesque setting for subject matter. He treated his Japanese bridge at least twice in 1895 and the theme of the water lily at least eight times in 1897\u201398. In the summers of 1899 and 1900, interrupted only by working trips to London (see cats. 38\u201341), he concentrated exclusively on this motif, producing a group of eighteen paintings featuring his Japanese bridge and pond. These summer campaigns also coincided with further renovations on his property\u2014by May 1901, Monet had purchased additional land with the intention of enlarging the water lily pond (fig. 37.2). Crafting his garden environment and painting the fruits of his labor would preoccupy Monet for much of the rest of his life (see cat. 44, cat. 46 and cat. 47).\n\nDuring the summer of 1899, Monet worked on twelve pictures of the pond, directly facing the Japanese bridge that spanned the width of the canvas. Although most of the paintings from the 1899 group are similar in size (nearly square), depict basically the same compositional elements, and feature a rather cool palette (e.g., fig. 37.3 [W1515]), Monet tweaked some of the viewpoints, especially through his use of differently formatted canvases and slight variations in the cropping of forms (e.g., fig. 37.4 [W1517] and fig. 37.5 [W1518]). The related six paintings Monet painted the following summer\u2014including the Art Institute\u2019s Water Lily Pond\u2014similarly feature the Japanese bridge, but the viewpoints vary more significantly. None include the perfect arch of the bridge from head on; Monet, rather, has moved himself to the left and back, making visible a larger number of the plantings on the bank in the foreground and presenting the structure seen asymmetrically and less dramatically arched (see also fig. 37.6 [W1630] and fig. 37.7 [W1633]). This reinforced associations between his works and the spatial constructs and subject matter used in prints by Japanese artist Utagawa Hiroshige (see fig. 37.8, fig. 37.9), a number of whose woodblock prints were in his personal collection.\n\nThe series of water lily pond paintings from the summers of 1899 and 1900 as a whole is strikingly divergent from those groups he had painted earlier in the 1890s, and, as has been discussed by the art historian Paul Tucker, they seem to recall Monet\u2019s Impressionist roots. Certainly the incorporation of active brushwork in boldly juxtaposed colors used in Water Lily Pond diverges from the smoother strokes and blended, tonal palette of the works in his most recent series Mornings on the Seine (see fig. 37.10) (cat. 36 [W1475]) and is perhaps more akin to the paintings Monet produced in the 1870s during his classic Impressionist phase. Notably also, Monet mapped out the composition for Water Lily Pond by laying in zones of thin, colored washes, as opposed to building up his surface with areas of paint that he let dry before covering them with additional paint layers (see Technical Report/Paint Application).\n\nThe novel quality of Monet\u2019s Water Lily Pond paintings did not go unnoticed by his contemporaries, and it seems likely that he himself was keen to publicize the change in his work. When Durand-Ruel organized a show of Monet\u2019s recent works in late 1900, twelve of the twenty-six works included were dedicated to the water lily motif. The Art Institute\u2019s Water Lily Pond was not one of those exhibited in this show; the fact that Monet signed and dated it, and sold it to L\u00e9once Rosenberg around the time of the exhibition suggests that the artist considered it completed.\n\nThe series was not embraced as widely as others that he exhibited in the 1890s, however. While some remarked on its dazzling radiance, others criticized a lack of variety of the vantage points. Charles Saunier, the art critic for La revue blanche, for example, enthusiastically praised the overall exhibition\u2014which also included works from Monet\u2019s earlier series\u2014but in response to the Water Lily Pond paintings, he remarked: \u201cIn front of these pictures, one senses the secret design of a cinematographer who noted the color, not the action\u2014the color, I say, but not the nuance.\u201d Despite Monet\u2019s flickering, impasted brushwork and bold application of color in the Water Lily Pond series, they indeed lack the ephemeral atmospheric effects\u2014the enveloppe\u2014that Monet foregrounded in the Mornings on the Seine paintings, especially the Art Institute\u2019s Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475]). Exemplifying Monet\u2019s ability to redirect his aesthetic concerns for each motif, his Water Lily Pond is more legible and independent; the viewer is not required to view it alongside others in the series in order to understand it.\n\nClose comparison of Water Lily Pond and Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) reveals apparent differences, but they also share aspects common to Monet\u2019s practice. Both works foreground a concern that vexed Monet throughout his career and dominated his choice of subject matter in the twentieth century\u2014the representation of water: its reflective properties as well as that ever-complex moment when it converges with land or sky at the horizon. Analysis of the transmitted-light photography of Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) and Water Lily Pond illuminates the differing approaches that Monet used to render this motif. In particular, it reveals that Monet painted areas of Water Lily Pond much more openly. Instead of applying paint relatively evenly across the surface to create reflections in the water, as he did in Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (fig. 37.11), Monet here leaves exposed areas of the ground and the thin washes that initially blocked in the composition (fig. 37.12). In this way he expresses water\u2019s transparency by exploiting the reflection of light off the ground layer. Notably, however, Monet did make adjustments to the areas where water meets air in both paintings. As mentioned in regard to Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist), Monet seems to have reworked the horizon line, obscuring it with the patch of blue haze in the central area of the composition. Although there are few compositional changes in Water Lily Pond, X-ray imaging (fig. 37.13) reveals that Monet did paint out some of the foliage (actual or reflected) in the area underneath the bridge, suggesting his continued struggle to convey the moment where reality ends and reflection begins.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Water Lily Pond was painted on a pre-primed, non-standard-size linen canvas. The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. A warp-thread match was detected with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection, suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 1933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), and Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156). The artist used deep tones of red, brown, and green, applied in thin washes, to map out the composition and provide the general tone for the work. The ground layer was left exposed in lighter areas of the composition, such as the far end of the pond and openings in the dense background foliage. Both the ground layer and the initial washes remain exposed throughout the composition, and some light abrasion of these layers seems to have occurred before the painting was further built up and may be the result of deliberate scraping or wiping of these layers by the artist. The foliage and flowers were built up using an open network of thick brushstrokes and impasto in brighter tones of green, yellow, pink, and purple. The work incorporates both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint applications, the latter indicating that the painting was carried out in more than one session, allowing sufficient time for some of the earlier layers to have dried.\n\nMultilayer Interactive Image Viewer\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 37.14).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1900 (upper left, in dark-red paint) (fig. 37.15). The underlying paint was mostly dry when the signature and date were applied, except for the bright-red strokes underneath the M, which were picked up by the signature (fig. 37.16).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nA report in the conservation file lists the previous stretcher dimensions as 89 \u00d7 100 cm. This does not correspond to a standard size, but both dimensions correspond to standard stretcher-bar sizes. The stretcher was probably custom ordered.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.3V (0.7) \u00d7 23.3H (0.6) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was determined with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 1933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), and Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156).\n\nThere is relatively even, mild-to-moderate cusping around all four edges. The cusping appears to be slightly more pronounced along the top edge. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1974 lining (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced 5.5\u00ad\u20139 cm apart. The current stretcher is slightly larger than the original foldover dimensions, resulting in a narrow band of exposed ground from the tacking margins around the edges of the composition. It appears that the lined canvas was slightly off square when it was restretched.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced approximately 5\u20137 cm apart. There are a few additional holes on the top and bottom edges. These probably relate to tacks added later to reinforce the edges.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher with vertical metal crossbar. Depth: 2.7 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The previous stretcher was probably the original stretcher. A photograph of the stretcher and an examination report in the conservation file record that the previous stretcher was a Buck type 2, consisting of six members, including a horizontal and a vertical crossbar, with mortise and tenon joints, and twelve keys. The report gives the following dimensions: height, 100 cm; width, 89 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; inside depth, 3 cm; stretcher-bar width, 7 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 7 cm (fig. 37.17).\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nIn UV light, evidence of a light-blue fluorescence below the ground layer suggests the presence of an organic layer, possibly glue sizing fig. 37.18).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Some fine, parallel ridges were observed in broad areas across the midleft side of the painting and in the upper left corner. The ridges appear to be either part of the ground layer or are directly on top of it. They are visible in the X-ray (fig. 37.19) and on the surface of the painting (fig. 37.20). In some areas, the overlying paint has been lightly abraded at the peaks, exposing the white tops of the ridges (fig. 37.21). The cause of these ridges is unclear. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 10 to 80 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 37.22).\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark (possibly red and black) particles visible under magnification (fig. 37.23). There are some relatively large, white clumps present (fig. 37.24).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was detected with infrared reflectography; however, a few black, splintery particles were observed microscopically at the back left edge of the pond (fig. 37.25). Some particles are directly on top of the ground layer, while others are incorporated into the greenish-yellow paint layer. The particles are visually similar to those associated with charcoal underdrawing on other Monet paintings in the Art Institute collection. In those cases, the charcoal particles had also sometimes been picked up by the paint layers. In this painting, however, there is insufficient evidence to say whether the artist may have used some preliminary drawing in the work.\n\nThe material was not sampled.\n\nThe composition was broadly mapped out using thin washes of paint in dark tones of brown, reddish brown, and green. In these thinly applied passages, the canvas texture remains prominent and the paint surface is often abraded, exposing the peaks of the canvas weave. It appears the artist scraped or wiped these initial paint layers before building up the composition (fig. 37.26, fig. 37.27). The lay-in provides the general tone for the shadowed areas of the composition, including the dark areas of dense foliage behind the bridge (fig. 37.28). Where the effects of the sunlight were depicted, in the foreground water for example, the initial washes of reddish brown and dark green were left open, leaving the ground layer exposed in those areas where the water lilies would be painted (fig. 37.29). Similarly, the sunlit area of the pond on the far side of the bridge, as well as the light areas at the upper left and upper right corners, were left in reserve at the lay-in stage, with unpainted ground providing much of the light tone in those parts (fig. 37.30, fig. 37.31). In areas of the distant sunlit water, the artist appears to have applied a very thin, translucent paint layer directly over the ground, which imparts a subtle, greenish-yellow tone in places (fig. 37.32, fig. 37.33). It seems that the general form of the bridge was indicated at the lay-in stage using strokes of thin purple and reddish-brown paint (fig. 37.34). The posts and railings were then painted on top of the broad underpainting, with the foliage built up in the negative space in between the supports (fig. 37.35). The bright green and yellow branches that hang down from the top edge of the composition appear to have been planned from early on, since more of the ground layer remains visible through breaks in the brushwork in that area (fig. 37.36). Monet then worked back and forth between the bridge and the foliage behind and in front of it (fig. 37.37).\n\nIn painting the foliage and the water lilies, Monet employed more varied brushwork, using individual strokes of paint that are both more colorful and more highly textured than the underlying layers. This buildup of paint is mostly applied in an open network such that areas of exposed ground and thin underpainting are juxtaposed against solid, opaque brushstrokes and dashes of impasto (fig. 37.38, fig. 37.39, fig. 37.40, fig. 37.41). The openness of the brushwork is emphasized when the painting is viewed in transmitted light: the initial thin layers of paint appear relatively transparent while the thicker strokes block the light and appear dark (fig. 37.42). The painting was carried out in several sessions. The initial thin layers of paint appear to have been dry for the most part when the landscape was worked up with the more textural strokes. The upper brushwork includes both wet-on-wet (fig. 37.43) and wet-over-dry (fig. 37.44) paint applications. The water lilies in the foreground and at the far end of the pond were blocked in using thick, lead white\u2013rich strokes applied over the thin underpainting layers; more colorful strokes were added on top when the thick white paint had already set (fig. 37.45, fig. 37.46). The artist often picked up multiple colors on his brush (fig. 37.47), depositing them on the canvas in strokes of unmixed colors. The more textural brushstrokes are often very free and gestural (fig. 37.48, fig. 37.49). For the long grasses at the left edge of the composition, Monet dragged stiff white and pale-yellowish-green paint lightly across the surface in flickering strokes that skip over the surface in places (fig. 37.50). Throughout the painting, he applied strokes of relatively flat, unmodulated color\u2014often deep greens and reds\u2014that cross over and conform to the dried impasto strokes underneath and serve to break up the surface (fig. 37.51).\n\nAlthough there are no major changes in the composition, a few small areas were painted out as the work was built up. This can be seen in the water underneath the bridge. The X-ray shows that more distinct vertical and diagonal brushstrokes from the reflected foliage were originally included in this area. These strokes were subsequently covered by the flat, rose-colored paint (fig. 37.52).\n\nBrushes, including 2\u20133 and 5 mm and 1.0 cm width, and possibly wider brushes used for broad underpainting; flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushmarks).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet. PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Only one type was analyzed by SERS and identified as madder lake. A bright, orange-pink fluorescence under ultraviolet light indicates that the artist used red lake throughout the work.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nIn 1997\u201398, the painting was cleaned and left unvarnished (see Conservation History). It has a relatively matte surface with subtle variations in surface sheen depending on the qualities of the paint application.\n\nThere is no early treatment report in the conservation file, but pretreatment photographs from 1974, showing the painting on its original stretcher and apparently unlined, were probably taken just before the painting was treated. The treatment probably included the wax-resin lining, restretching on the current ICA spring stretcher, and the application of a synthetic varnish. A natural-resin varnish may have been removed at this time as well, based on the presence of yellowed varnish residues in the recesses of the brushwork.\n\nIn 1997\u201398, the synthetic varnish and old natural resin varnish residues were removed. The paint surface was aqueously cleaned, and glue residues embedded in the paint texture were removed.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. There is minor wear and abrasion on the tacking edges. There are several old splits in the canvas at the original foldovers, especially along the top and bottom edges. Areas of light abrasion in the ground and the earliest paint layers, which expose the peaks of the canvas weave in places occurred while Monet was still working on the painting, possibly as part of his working process. Cracking in the paint layer is minimal and where present it is very fine, visible mainly only under magnification. There are localized drying cracks, as well as pronounced microcracking specific to brushstrokes containing yellow paint. One small area of old flake losses was observed in one of these yellow areas. There are some starch-paste residues from the previous lining treatment in the recesses of the more textured paint. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches on a quadrillage bed with leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding and a nonoriginal, painted, fillet liner. The frame has both water and oil gilding. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the cast foliate on the ogee and sight molding, the scotia sides, and the liner. Red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The frame has an overall gold-bronze tone, with casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes and dark flecking. The frame has a glued poplar substrate with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with cast, stylized, running undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 37.53).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to L\u00e9once Rosenberg, Paris, Dec. 1900.\n\nAcquired by the Prince de Wagram, 1904.\n\nAcquired by L\u00e9once Rosenberg, Paris, by July 22, 1914.\n\nSold by L\u00e9once Rosenberg, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, July 22, 1914, for 21,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Dec. 3 or 30, 1914.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Arthur Meeker, Chicago, Apr. 8, 1915, for $7,400.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, by 1933.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932), Chicago, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">New York, Durand-Ruel Galleries, Paintings by Claude Monet, Feb. 1\u201316, 1915, cat. 8.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Exhibition of the Mrs. L.

The paintings of water lilies that Monet completed in 1897\u201398 have been identified as those works that he rediscovered in 1914 and that reinvigorated his project for a mural cycle (see Water Lily Pond [cat. 47] and Irises [cat. 46]). Monet explained: \u201cI am even planning to embark on some big paintings, for which I found some old attempts in a basement. Clemenceau saw them and was amazed. Anyway, you\u2019ll see something of this soon, I hope.\u201d Monet to Gustave Geffroy, Apr. 30, 1914, quoted and translated in Richard Kendall, Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters (Macdonald Orbis, 1989), p. 247; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 4, Peintures, 1899\u20131926 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1985), p. 390, letter 2116.

It is not known whether Monet owned impressions of these prints at the time of painting Water Lily Pond, however. But, as noted by John House, by 1895 \u201cMonet\u2019s awareness of Japanese art was inseparable from his direct experiences of nature\u201d and that \u201ceven where we can compare his paintings with particular Japanese prints which he owned, he may well have bought the print in question after he had painted the work it resembles, perhaps even because of this resemblance.\u201d John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 58.\n\nPaul Hayes Tucker, \u201cThe Revolution in the Garden: Monet in the Twentieth Century,\u201d in Paul Hayes Tucker with George T. M. Shackelford and MaryAnne Stevens, Monet in the 20th Century, exh. cat. (Royal Academy of Arts, London/Museum of Fine Arts, Boston/Yale University Press, 1998), p. 23. Tucker suggests that Monet\u2019s change in style had much to do with the Dreyfus affair (an intense political scandal in French history involving Alfred Dreyfus, French army officer of Jewish descent falsely charged with treason) and signaled Monet\u2019s belief that France should step back and reassess its core values. These ideas are discussed in Monet in the 20th Century as well as in Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet in the \u201890s: The Series Paintings, exh. cat.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (normal light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains vermilion, cobalt violet, and red lake; other pigments may also be present.

See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 21, 2014.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using [glossary:SEM/EDX], PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 21, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 17, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WLPond\\_33\\_441\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPossible charcoal particles were found in several of the paint scraping samples analyzed with PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" May 21, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn areas where the ground layer is exposed, it too is often abraded, with the peaks of the canvas threads visible at the surface. This abrasion also appears to have occurred while Monet was working on the painting, since subsequent brushwork passes over the abraded areas.\n\nIn the upper left corner, pale-purple paint was added later over the areas of exposed ground, providing the light tone in some places.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM; XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM); madder lake (SERS). XRF analysis detected cobalt and arsenic in areas of purple paint, indicating that the cobalt violet is a cobalt arsenate. Paint scraping samples taken in 1974 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 21, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_441\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 17, 2013; Federica Pozzi, \"SERS\\_spectroscopy\\_results,\" Apr. 17, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WLPond\\_33\\_441\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.

See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
