    "description": "<p>This spare jar, or <em>olla</em>, with it narrowed neck, rounded shoulder that smoothly transitions into its large, globular body, was not made to serve a religious function, but rather represents one of many different vessels intended for storage purposes in the home. Made in Santo Domingo Pueblo, a community noted for its highly traditional culture that maintained a conservative ceramic tradition, displaying little variation in shape or designs since the latter half of the 18th century. Coated with a cream-white slip in the Kiua manner and ornamented with an elegant, spare design in black pigment, this sophisticated vessel is an example of Santo Domingo Kiua ware at its very best. The swelling body features three oval panels outlined in black, while the shoulder and neck display a register of ovoid shapes, each ornamented with two curving inner brushstroke appendages. Other fine calligraphic touches consist of teardrop-shaped motifs between the upper band ovoids, fine-line dashes below the rim, and a characteristic break in the shoulder-line\u2014an \u201cimperfection\u201d included to satisfy the Creator Spirit.<br>This pueblo and its neighbor Cochiti, are noted for their highly conservative culture. Kiua Polychrome jars and bowls have been made since the latter half of the 18th century with certain variations. The Kiua style continued into the very early 20th century. This vessel is most sophisticated in its design and execution, and as an example of Santo Domingo Kiua ware at its very best, it would be an important addition to our AIC collection.</p>\n",
