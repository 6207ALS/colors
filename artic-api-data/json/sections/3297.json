Delaney Fund, 2010.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse printed this monotype on a press he purchased in 1914. Rather than drawing his design directly on the copper printing plate using brush and ink, the artist used a subtractive technique that resulted in an inverse, white-on-black image. Working on a copper plate coated with an even layer of black printing ink, he employed a sharp, pointed implement, like a drypoint needle, to \u201cdraw\u201d his composition. Moving the implement across the inked plate pushed medium aside, leaving lines devoid of ink. When printed, those lines revealed the white of the paper. A photomicrograph shows how the black ink pooled along the sides and at the ends of the lines where it was pushed aside by the needle (fig. 21.1). The process allowed for a freedom of line very much akin to that of drawing (see fig. 21.2 and fig. 21.3). The method did not allow for error, as any disruption of the ink film would be recorded in the print.\n\nPrinting the monotype chine coll\u00e9 allowed marks of great delicacy and fineness to be recorded in the layer of smooth, soft, thin, Chinese paper that would not have been achievable on a heavier European plate paper alone. As is typical for works printed chine coll\u00e9, the ivory wove plate paper supports the thin, grayish-ivory, image-bearing chine paper and serves as a visual framing element.\n\nThere is a printing flaw that appears as a 2.5 cm band of lighter ink across the width of the composition approximately 2 cm above the bottom edge of the image. This may have been caused by uneven pressure applied across the plate. The ink did not print evenly along the top edge. By holding the plate at the edges, Matisse may have removed some ink with his fingers (see fig. 21.4).\n\nInscribed and signed: Monotype/Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 21.5).\n\nMonotype in black ink, printed chine coll\u00e9.\n\nThe primary support is very thin, smooth, grayish-ivory China paper. This paper is identified as China paper due to its light weight, hue, and soft surface. By definition, China paper is used for the primary, image-bearing support in chine coll\u00e9.\n\nThe secondary support is thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper. This paper is a soft plate paper well suited to accepting the imprint of the copper plate. It is thick and strong and acts to support and frame the thin Chinese paper upon which the ink sits. The chine coll\u00e9 was printed on the smoother felt side. The wire side (verso; fig. 21.6) bears a more pronounced screen pattern. The paper fibers are of uniform color. All edges are straight cut.\n\nThere is a partial impressed watermark along the lower half of the right edge of the secondary support: A. LEPAGE AINE. TOCH (0.8 \u00d7 13.8 cm) (fig. 21.7). The complete watermark reads: A. LEPAGE AINE TOCHON-LEPAGE SUCCR. The impressed watermark was pressed onto the damp sheet by means of rubber or metal matrix affixed to a dandy roll.\n\nImage/plate: 18 \u00d7 13 cm (7 1/16 \u00d7 5 1/8 in.); primary support: 17.8 \u00d7 12.8 cm (7 \u00d7 5 in.); secondary support: 36.7 \u00d7 27.2 cm (14 3/8 \u00d7 10 5/8 in.).\n\nIn 2009 a face mat that had been adhered with pressure-sensitive tape (estimated to be Scotch tape) at the top right, top left, and center of the lower edge was mechanically removed. In 2015 the margins of the support were surface cleaned. Testing was carried out to release white paper tape from the perimeter of the verso, but the treatment was not undertaken due to perceived risk to the paper support.\n\nThe monotype is in very good condition overall. Slight abrasions appear in the lower right quadrant between the leaves. The sheet has darkened from exposure to light and acidic housing materials. A 1 cm band along the edges retains the original paper tone. The sheet has also darkened subtly from light exposure in a 1 cm band around the image where once exposed by a smaller window mat. The plate mark is strong.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Unidentified owner, London, by Sept. 16, 2009\u2013Feb. 10, 2010.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 10, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, Mar. 20\u2013June 20, 2010, cat. 22r (ill.), as Still Life with Goldfish (III), 1914\u201315; New York, Museum of Modern Art, July 18\u2013Oct. 11, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Marguerite Duthuit-Matisse and Claude Duthuit, Henri Matisse: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9, with the collaboration of Fran\u00e7oise Garnaud, vol. 1 (C.
