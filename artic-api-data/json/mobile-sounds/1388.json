    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Roses, hyacinths and tulips describe a graceful rhythm on this tankard. It comes from the celebrated kilns of Iznick near Constantinia [ph?] today\u2019s Istanbul the capital of the far reaching Ottoman Empire. This vessel is made of frit a mixture of clay and ground stone. Frit gives a pure white surface that takes pigments well. Skilled Persian potters developed frit-ware in order to achieve some of the effects possible only with Chinese porcelain whose raw materials and high temperature firing were a mystery and would remain a secret for centuries. The cloud bands along the rim and the base are imported Chinese motifs. The floral ornamentation and under glaze technique derive from Chinese blue and white ceramics but display local blossoms in rich and brilliant colors. That deep red was a sixteenth century innovation that came out of the Iznik kilns. So this tankard was technologically very cutting edge. In the Islamic world flowers and gardens were associated with love poetry and paradise. Carnations flavored sherbets and adorned the official signature of the Ottoman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. In Europe, tulip mania exploded in Holland. When the market in Turkish bulbs crashed in 1637 thousands of families were ruined but the Dutch never lost their affection for these fabulous blooms.</p>\n",
