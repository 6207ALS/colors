    "description": "<p>This is one of four large canvases devoted to the life of Saint John the Baptist that Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo painted for the convent of San Leandro in his native Seville, Spain. Inscriptions from the gospels of John and Luke, accompanied by the animal symbols of these evangelists, float in the sky and attest to the Baptist\u2019s role in preparing the way for Christ. When he painted this series, Murillo was transitioning away from the hard edges and dramatic shading, called <em>chiaroscuro</em>, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/42406/francisco-de-zurbaran\">Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n</a> toward softer, more vaporous effects.</p>\n",

Dauzat, probably on behalf of Baron Taylor for the collection of King Louis-Philippe of France, by September 1837 [see Angulo \u00cd\u00f1iguez 1981, p. 21 and Baticle and Marinas 1981]; Louis-Philippe, Paris and London, by 1838 (d. 1850) [according to Notice des tableaux..., 1838]; his heirs, sold Christie\u2019s, London, 6-21 May 1853, no. 74, for \u00a3660 [there is some confusion about the buyer at the Louis-Philippe sale: though the Illustrated London News, 21 May 1853, p. 400 states that it was bought by Farrer for a client in Manchester, the copy of the auctioneer\u2019s book in Christie\u2019s archives appears to be marked to Steward, Stewand or Towend, copy and letter of Estelle Gittens dated 20 December 2000 in curatorial file; since the painting was later in the collection of Thomas Townend, Manchester, both may be correct; there is no evidence that it was ever in the collection of the duc de Montpensier as reported by Tubino 1864 and Roberts 1897]; Thomas Townend (d. 1865) of Manchester and later Brighton, presumably by descent to his daughter Elizabeth Shepherd Townend Hall (d. Feb. 1883), Syndale, Kent by 1865 until 1883; offered for sale as from the estate of Thomas Townend, Brighton, Christie\u2019s, London, 14 July 1883, no. 73, bought in at 110 guineas [73 written in chalk and a stencilled 130S, both on the back of the painting, confirm that it was in this sale; see email from Lynda McLeod, Christie\u2019s, 26 Feb. 2002; annotated catalog says \u00a3115.10 to Purvis]; by descent to Blanche Mary Townend Hall Bullen (d. 1886); on her death to her husband Major John Bullen Symes Bullen, whom she had married on 26 June 1884 [this geneology clarified in a letter of 24 June 2002 from Arthur Percival, the Faversham Society, to Tiffany Johnston in curatorial file]; by descent to Lt.-Colonel John Fitzherbert Symes Bullen of Catherston-Leweston, Dorset [according to Soria 1960 and Bullen\u2019s daughter, Jennie Loriston-Clarke, who remembered seeing it in the hall of her father's home; conversation of 8 May 2002 with Tiffany Johnston].  Appleby Brothers, London, by June 1954 [according to Burlington Magazine 1954]; sold by Appleby Brothers to Agnew\u2019s, London, 19 July 1954 [according to letter of 3 September 1998 from Christopher Kingzett in curatorial file]; sold to Art Institute of Chicago, 1960.",
