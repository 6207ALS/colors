He may have mailed it to the writer from Tahiti; creases in the paper indicate that it was folded at some stage in its history.\n\nThere is no irrefutable evidence for the work\u2019s date, but Gauguin may well have made it shortly after producing an important painting on the motif in 1891 (fig. 47.2 [W 430]). Perhaps he wished to convey the appearance of the canvas\u2019s key protagonist to the writer, or perhaps he sought to initiate an interpretive discussion. It seems unlikely that, in the early 1890s, Gauguin had developed a definitive reading of his woodcutter. He revisited the theme on several occasions, working in different media and placing the figure in a variety of settings. A pen-and-ink rendition of the subject, which is devoid of landscape but includes a wood log, is also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (fig. 47.3 [cat. 62]).\n\nIn the major painted version of the scene, a bending woman and a sailboat suggest that the man with the ax is part of a broader community (the Art Institute\u2019s drawing bears a direct relationship to this work). In another midsize canvas of the same year, Matamoe (Landscape with Peacocks) (fig. 47.4 [W 484]), the scene is set inland and the figure appears in relative isolation. At different stages in his career, Gauguin listed Matamoe as \u201cThe Woodcutter of Pia\u201d and \u201cDeath,\u201d inferring that even the meaning of a single work was liable to change. Accordingly, though possible readings do emerge, interpretations of the Art Institute\u2019s drawing cannot be definitive.\n\nWriting after he finished the canvas, but probably before he made illustrations based on its composition, Gauguin provided an account of a related episode in his 1893 autobiographical text Noa Noa: Voyage \u00e0 Tahiti. He recounted watching his neighbor cut wood in a riverside setting like that in his painting. The youth raised a heavy ax \u201cthat left, at the top of its stroke, its blue imprint on the silver sky,\u201d upon which he brought down the ax on a dead tree. As Linda Goddard argued in relation to the painting Man with an Ax, by omitting the wood from the image, the artist imbued a quotidian act with considerable dramatic tension. The same observation holds true for the Art Institute\u2019s work. Here, with the figure shown in solitude, the viewer can focus still more intently on his energy and concentration.\n\nGauguin added further intrigue to the image with the inclusion of spindly leaves in the lower foreground of both canvas and gouache. In his text, the artist likened these forms to the indecipherable letters \u201cof an unknown mysterious language\u201d in which he claimed he discerned the Tahitian name for God (atua). For Goddard the pattern of the leaves (too large for their setting and at odds with the rendering of perspective) becomes a visual metaphor for the harmonious sounds of Oceanic languages. For Dario Gamboni, who interpreted them in light of nineteenth-century graphology studies, they reflect how Gauguin and his contemporaries understood the writing of the \u201cOrient\u201d as \u201csensual\u201d and \u201cmystical,\u201d in stark contrast to the \u201cdeductive, logical, reasoning\u201d of Western script. A similar strategy\u2014a use of pattern as parable\u2014is at work in Gauguin\u2019s 1892 Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 47.5 [W 458]). In this painting, where neither figure appears to speak, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory suggested that the leaves take the place of the words (parau) mentioned in the title. Arguably, with its paper support and more manageable format, the Art Institute\u2019s gouache encourages comparisons between text and image to an even greater degree. Man with an Ax, like Parau na te varua ino, invites the viewer to \u201cread\u201d the picture; but, like the leaves themselves, it is to some degree illegible.\n\nAlthough the meaning of the woodcutter motif may have shifted across Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre, in formal terms, the artist barely revised his design for the figure. His appearance is uniformly consistent in a number of works. In the museum\u2019s drawing, as elsewhere, the man wears a loincloth. His body faces the viewer, as he swings his ax aloft, his hands closed in an implausible grip. While his identity is uncertain, at times Gauguin referred to the woodcutter as Jotefa (or other variations on the name Joseph). However, given the artist\u2019s taste for controversy, he may have chosen this name because of its obvious Christian heritage. Joseph, the biblical carpenter transposed to a Tahitian setting, becomes a \u201csavage\u201d who sources raw materials. In this sense, rather than designating an individual, the naming convention reiterates that the man with an ax is emblematic. The colors in the museum\u2019s Man with an Ax were originally exaggerated and, though the darkening of the paper support has diminished their intensity, their artificial brightness was another signal that the scene is ultimately symbolic.\n\nHowever, given that Gauguin communicated desire for his companion in his written story of the woodcutter, art historians have speculated that the figure relates to an actual person. In sexually charged terms, the artist wrote of a joint excursion into the forest; observing Jotefa\u2019s \u201cgraceful contours,\u201d he explained, \u201clove took power to blossom in me. And we were only . . . the two of us . . . I had a sort of presentiment of crime, the desire for the unknown, the awakening of evil. Then weariness of the male role, having always to be strong, protective; shoulders that are a heavy load. To be for a minute the weak being who loves and obeys.\u201d Ashamed of his feelings, particularly given his companion\u2019s apparent innocence, Gauguin saw the act of felling a tree as an outlet for his aggressive energy. \u201cSavage both of us, we attacked with the axe a magnificent tree which had to be destroyed to get a branch suitable to my desires. I struck furiously and, my hands covered with blood, hacked away with the pleasure of sating one\u2019s brutality and of destroying something. In time with the noise of the axe I sang: Cut down by the foot of the whole forest / Cut down in yourself the love of yourself, as a man / Would cut down with his hand in autumn the Lotus.\u201d\n\nMaintaining that the man with an ax does not represent a specific individual, Daniel S. Brown suggested that Gauguin\u2019s account of his\u2014successfully suppressed\u2014yearning for his companion was influenced by his familiarity with the writing of the philosopher Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle, whose work the artist had discovered in Brittany through his friend Meijer de Haan, contended that self-regulation was an essential tenet of masculinity. For Brown, Gauguin\u2019s lust for \u201cJotefa\u201d signified the artist\u2019s energy, which, if channeled through social unity, could serve the greater good.\n\nHowever, in another recent account, Nancy Mowll Mathews suggested that Lieutenant J\u00e9not, a young Frenchman who worked for Captain Swaton (on whose boat Gauguin made the last leg of his 1891 trip to Tahiti), was perhaps the inspiration for the woodcutter in Noa Noa (and so, by association, the Art Institute\u2019s work). The two men became friends and spent hours discussing aesthetics, and it was J\u00e9not who, in real life, took the artist to obtain wood supplies from an old man who lived in the mountains. Mowll Mathews looked at the wording of the story and fixed on the word paia, which the young man uttered questioningly once Gauguin had become exhausted by the task of cutting wood. In his account, the artist employed the French word \u201ccontent,\u201d which, in English translation, can mean \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201chappy.\u201d But Mowll Mathews argues that his use of \u201ccontent\u201d was eccentric and that more typically paia is an adjective meaning \u201cslippery\u201d or even a noun meaning \u201csodomy.\u201d This would clearly align the story with homosexual desire\u2013with feelings that, to protect the identity of soon-to-be married J\u00e9not\u2013Gauguin recounted in a story that featured a Tahitian woodcutter.\n\nMowll Mathews supported her argument by citing the writer and collector Thad\u00e9e Natanson. When Gauguin told the story of the woodcutter to his Parisian circle in 1893, they found the tale unsettling. \u201cWe were all disturbed, indeed more than he, by the ambiguous sensuality that radiated from the brilliant back of the youth to the teeth of his smile, of which the painter only said that they were hardly different from the body and smile of his companions [in France] of the same age.\u201d Although Gauguin clearly intended his account to push the boundaries of acceptable behavior (as was also true of so much of his art), the story was probably disturbing in a more general sense, since nineteenth-century anthropologists tended to broadly frame non-European gender constructs as relatively unstable. Stephen Eisenman argued that Gauguin\u2019s excursion with the woodcutter was effectively a walk toward polymorphous sexuality, a blurring of the boundaries between male and female (Gauguin expressed his desire for the woodcutter as a longing to be female and subservient). Certainly, the soft forms of the woodcutter\u2019s body in the Art Institute\u2019s Man with an Ax and in the larger painting appear slightly androgynous, while his downcast eyes could suggest submission. There is little sense of individualization at work in the representation. It is even possible that, in addition to questioning the division between the sexes, Gauguin sought to amalgamate non-Western peoples with the wider natural world. While the artist paid no special formal attention to the figure in the gouache\u2014his description of the landscape is no less detailed\u2014his text likens his companion to their surrounds: \u201cThe two of us carried our load cheerfully, and I could again admire, in front of me, the graceful curves of my young friend\u2014and calmly: curves robust like the tree we were carrying.\u201d Though he argued in Noa Noa that, in felling the tree with bloody hands, he too became \u201ca different man, a Maori\u201d \u2014perhaps like the woodcutter himself\u2014Goddard questioned Gauguin\u2019s supposed conversion. The language with which he recounted the episode references erudite Western writers, including Charles Baudelaire and Edgar Allan Poe, conveying his adoption of a \u201csavage\u201d identity with a literary sophistication that would have been obvious to his Parisian peers.\n\nNonetheless, the imagery of Matamoe (where, already, a fire of cut wood burns next to the man with an ax) is a helpful reminder that the artist recognized that an act of destruction can also signal rebirth. One early admirer of the work, who does seem to have associated the woodcutter with Gauguin, was the playwright Alfred Jarry (see fig. 47.6). Jarry had listened to the artist read sections of Noa Noa in Paris in 1893 and, recognizing him as a type of destroyer-creator, wrote a poem about the Man with an Ax. The resulting verses are at once humorous and reverent, incorporating wordplay to create an array of shifting images. For instance, the poem mentions the \u201cl\u00e9zards\u201d (lizards) that gather at the feet of the man with an ax (clearly, in this instance, Gauguin himself). Yet the French word \u201cl\u00e9zards\u201d sounds like \u201cles arts\u201d (the arts). Not only animals but the arts themselves are in awe of an extraordinary artist. As Jill Fell explains, fluidity and mobility are central themes and characteristics of the poem: a chariot becomes a marble throne, which in turn becomes a carved canoe, ready for pursuit. Jarry\u2019s poem seems an entirely appropriate response to Gauguin\u2019s words and images, which are similarly in a perpetual state of flux. Just as the poet\u2019s woodcutter hesitates before striking, the viewer of Man with an Ax is arrested by the moment, invited to focus on the beauty of the lifted blade. Included here is a new, liberal, English translation by Roger Hutchin, which aims to retain the rhythm of the French original:\n\n\u201cThe Man with an Axe\u201d  \nAfter and for P. Gauguin  \n\nOn the horizon, through the haze,  \nUnseen hazards a ruckus raise,  \nFor waves, our spirits we make ready  \nthat twixt the peaks in canyons eddy.  \nOn that shore to which we home  \nStands high a giant upon the loam.  \nAt his feet, lizard-like, we slither.  \nAkin to chariot-borne Caesar  \nOr marble-mounted statue, he  \nHews a boat from trunk of tree  \nOn which he\u2019ll stand us to pursue  \nTill all green lands are lost to view.  \nFrom the bank his arms bronze-made  \nSkyward lift the blue-edged blade.  \n\nTranslation by Roger Hutchin  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly from the artist to Georges Daniel de Monfreid (1856\u20131929), Paris.\n\nSold at Sotheby\u2019s, New York, to Alice Adam, Chicago, for Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, Nov. 19, 1986, lot 34.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 183; Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20 1989 (Washington, D.C., only).\n\nAuckland (New Zealand) City Art Gallery, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, Aug. 4\u2013Oct. 15, 1995, cat. 28.\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.
