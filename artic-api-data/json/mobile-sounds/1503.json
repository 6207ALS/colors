    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  In the early 1700s, Boston lawyers, accountants and merchants conducted their businesses from their homes. An impressive desk and bookcase like this was an essential tool. When open for business, it became an efficient workstation. The slanted top flipped down to provide a writing surface, two little shelves just under the mirrored doors, pulled out to hold candles. All manner of cubbyholes and small drawers held documents and account books. At the end of the business day, with the slant top and doors closed, it gave quiet testimony to its owner's wealth. The desk below and the bookcase above, are actually separate cabinets with carrying handles on the sides. The lavishly carved exterior surfaces are all made from costly imported mahogany. The hidden interior structure was built using less expensive domestic oak and pine.</p>\n",
