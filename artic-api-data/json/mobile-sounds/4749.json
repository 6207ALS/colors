    "transcript": "<p>Kehinde Wiley painted this portrait, titled Barack Obama, in 2018. The medium is oil on canvas. The<br>painting is over seven feet tall and nearly five feet wide. At its center, Barack Obama sits in a carved<br>wooden chair, looking straight at the viewer. His chair is partially enveloped by a backdrop of lush foliage<br>in a range of greens, including deep aqua and jade, extending to all edges of the canvas. Occasional<br>blossoms in orange, pink, white, and purple dot the scene.</p>\n<p>President Obama wears an all-black suit, black shoes, and a white collared shirt. The top few buttons of<br>his shirt are open in a casual manner. He sits with his feet firmly planted, knees wide apart and arms<br>folded, elbows resting on his knees. The skin of his face and hands shines in golden-brown hues, and his<br>black hair is tinged with gray. He gazes straight ahead with an expression that is calm, confident, and<br>engaged.</p>\n<p>The entire portrait is rendered in realistic detail, but the brightness of its colors give it a heightened,<br>almost fantastic quality. So does its leafy setting. Imagine a wall of greenery, and nestled in it is a man in</p>\n<p>a chair, any sense of ground obscured by the foliage beneath him. The president appears abstractly<br>situated in this way, individual leaves overlapping the chair, his clothes, and his shoes.</p>\n",
