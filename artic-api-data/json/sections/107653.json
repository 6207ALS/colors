    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">Christ wears a shako, the tall, cylindrical military cap, often topped by a feather, of the Belgian civil guard and artillery (see fig. 1). Similar hats appear in Ensor\u2019s multi-sheet composite drawing The Strike (The Slaughter of the Ostend Fisherman [August 1887]) (fig. 2), which he made at the same time as The Temptation. The shako in The Temptation was likely added later in the drawing process; it is rendered in black and red crayon (possibly Cont\u00e9) over an arc of light and clouds that were created with black colored pencil lines and cross-hatching. Ensor\u2019s addition of this hat aligns his representation with the idea of Christ as an engaged militant favored by the Belgian socialist party (see \u201cEnsor\u2019s Panache\u201d for more on the shako and other military headgear of Ensor\u2019s time).\n\nExtending over the lines of the sun\u2019s rays, the clouds were slightly enlarged. A sewing hole from the former binding of the folio, together with three fine pinholes, are visible along its center. SMC/KJN\n\nfig. 1 A French naval shako, probably for the infantry, c. 1829.
