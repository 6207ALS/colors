In textile design, a scheme of two or more colors is called a colorway. In painting, it is called a palette. In this six week course, participants will sketch compelling colorways and palettes found in the collection and create a signature color way of their own.</p><p>Materials are provided, as is supportive instruction. Classes are for people ages 16 and up.</p><p>See all upcoming sketch classes and workshops.
