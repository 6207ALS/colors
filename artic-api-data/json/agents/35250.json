    "description": "<p>Algimantas Kezys trained as a Jesuit priest in his birth country, Lithuania, before becoming a photographer. He developed a quasi-invented field that he came to call \u201cdesign-oriented documentary photography,\u201d which emphasized pattern and line in photographs that represented subjects from life. Kezys moved to the United States in 1950, settling in Chicago. He exhibited his photographs in local venues such as the Lithuanian Youth Center in Chicago and published them in books on a wide range of topics, including religious rites and celebrations, <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2135164140003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">world\u2019s fairs</a>, and scenes in <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2131216050003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2122247780003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\">Lithuania</a>.
