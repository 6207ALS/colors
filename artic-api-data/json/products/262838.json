    "description": "One of the finest examples outside of Naples, the Art Institute\u2019s spectacular cr\u00e8che features over 200 figures\u2014including no less than 50 animals and 41 still-life objects\u2014configured in an ornate cabinet with a painted backdrop. Those familiar with the Nativity and the story of Christmas will recognize a handful of central characters up front: Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the three wise men, for instance. But as just a glance will tell you, the scope of this tableau reaches far beyond biblical sources. Find as many as you can with this Advent Calendar.",
