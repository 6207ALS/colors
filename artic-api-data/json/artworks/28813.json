It demonstrates not only the impact of artists he encountered in Rome, such as Rubens and Poussin, but also the audacious technical innovations he initiated, painting fluently with pigment and oil on paper. The obscure pagan subject was undoubtedly aimed at a select and erudite Roman audience.</p>\n",
