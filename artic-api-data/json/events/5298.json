Through her work as a cultural administrator and educator, she focuses on contemporary artistic connections between the United States and Puerto Rico, while also working in spaces that foster, promote and cater to queer, BIPOC, Latinx, and Caribbean communities. </p><p>Previously, Gabriela has worked for the academic magazine <em>Visi\u00f3n Doble</em>, the production company Como Im\u00e1genes, and the research center CRiiAS. Currently, she is a teaching assistant in the Art History and Academic SPINE departments at SAIC, and a graduate peer advisor for students seeking professional development. This summer she will be an intern in the Art Institute's Department of Learning and Public Engagement. During her free time, Gabriela holds an artistic practice centered in mosaic, hoping to bridge the gaps between craft and contemporary art.</p><p><strong>Lillian Young</strong> is a summer intern in the Art Institute's Department of Learning and Public Engagement. She is a historical artist, focused on under-represented moments and people in African American history, and has taught in various galleries, classrooms, and online settings.
