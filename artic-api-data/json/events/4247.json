    "description": "<p>This week, the movie <em>Green Book</em> won an Academy Award for Best Picture, sparking debates about race and the ways in which films configure the power dynamics of interracial friendships. In this month\u2019s Intersections, we\u2019ll look at two works of American art to reflect on ways that a person\u2019s experience shapes their conception of race, using productive dialogue to create new narratives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.</p><p>Visit the&nbsp;<a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a>&nbsp;to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
