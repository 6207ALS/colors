    "description": "This gorgeous pin features the iconic spiral motif that was so influential in ancient Minoan and Mycenaean art. Believed to represent waves, the theme is found on vase paintings and wall paintings throughout the Aegean Bronze Age, such as the Dolphin Fresco from the Palace at Knossos on Crete (c. 1500 BC). The brooch is based on an ancient jewel dating to the sixth century BC.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\"Karpathia\" was mentioned in the Mycenaean Linear B clay tablets known as the Sphagianes Land Tablets, dating c. 1300 BC. Sphagianes was located within the district of Pylos, in the Peloponessus. Mycenaean women could be independent, and could own land.
