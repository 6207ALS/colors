    "description": "<p>In 1941, Jacob Lawrence, then just 23 years old, made a series of 60 small tempera paintings on the Great Migration, the decades-long mass movement of black Americans from the rural South to the urban North that began in 1915\u201316. The child of migrant parents, Lawrence worked partly from his own experience and partly from long research in his neighborhood library. The result was an epic narrative of the collective history of his people. Moving from scenes of terror and violence to images of great intimacy, and drawing on film, photography, political cartoons and other sources in popular culture, Lawrence created an innovative format of sequential panels, each image accompanied by a descriptive caption. Within months of its completion, the series entered the collections of The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Phillips Memorial Gallery (today The Phillips Collection), Washington, DC, each institution acquiring 30 panels.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Softcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>9.5 x 12 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 192</li><li><strong>Illustrations:&nbsp;</strong>77 color / 25 bw.</li></ul>",
