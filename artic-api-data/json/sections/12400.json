The economic boom of the 1920s had fueled an appetite for contemporary luxury goods, and with the rise of European silversmiths working in a modern vein, such as France\u2019s Jean Puiforcat and Denmark\u2019s Georg Jensen, Gorham saw an opportunity to tap into an area of new growth. The company recruited Erik Magnussen, a Danish silversmith of international renown, as a designer of \u201cspecial work\u201d to reflect the aesthetic developments well underway in Europe and gaining traction in America. Gorham demonstrated its commitment to this new perspective by letting Magnussen work independently, free from the oversight of the firm\u2019s chief designer, William Codman, who was responsible for its vast inventory of predominantly historical-revival silverwares. Within a year of Magnussen\u2019s arrival and his design of modernist objects such as this covered compote, Good Furniture Magazine declared his work evidence that \u201cAmerica has changed its style.\u201d\n\nMagnussen began his artistic training as a sculptor but turned to metalsmithing in 1902, working as a chaser for silversmiths in Denmark and Berlin before opening his own shop in Copenhagen in 1909. He exhibited his work widely, with shows in Berlin, Copenhagen, Paris, and the 1922 World\u2019s Fair in Rio de Janeiro. Magnussen\u2019s early work is strongly indebted to silver produced by Jensen, whose aesthetic principles\u2014most notably the use of stylized floral and vegetal motifs, bright surfaces, and undulating forms\u2014carried over into his designs for Gorham. However, the pared-down geometry and rhythmic quality of this covered compote embody Magnussen\u2019s intention to develop a new aesthetic befitting his adopted country. Indeed, Magnussen wanted his new designs to be \u201csomething very big of America, and for America.\u201d At times his efforts were met with mixed results, as in the case of the designer\u2019s infamous Cubist coffee service (see fig. 85.1), nicknamed \u201cThe Lights and Shadows of Manhattan,\u201d which some lauded as capturing \u201cthe spirit of America\u201d and others derided as \u201ccubistic claptrap.\u201d However, Magnussen\u2019s bold aesthetic ambitions successfully translated into works such as the compote, which stood out for their elegant simplicity, functionality, and opulence. One critic declared, \u201cIt is not too much to say that [Magnussen] has developed an American style\u2014a style that is plain, dignified, pure of line, and yet with an indefinable touch of the newer, modern feeling.\u201d\n\nThe Magnussen compote imbues a traditional form with this modern spirit. Its restrained ornament and elegant proportions are reminiscent of Neoclassical austerity but updated in a contemporary mode. The predominant design motif is a series of radiating lines that segment the gently swelling forms of the foot, stem, and bowl. A drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design Museum illustrates the exacting nature of Magnussen\u2019s seemingly simple plan, with detailed notations as to the distance between each delicately chased line and cross sections that mark the position and depth of the carved portions of the ivory finial and stem. Magnussen created numerous variations on this motif, including a similar compote and pair of candlesticks that were carried at specialty stores around the country. Chicago\u2019s own silver retailer, Spaulding &amp; Co., sold Magnussen\u2019s modern work for Gorham and in a 1928 advertisement illustrated a drawing of a similarly fluted double compote as \u201ctypical of the unusual things in Silver\u201d one might find in the shop. Magnussen also parlayed this design into an even more restrained and reasonably priced line of machine-spun silver called Modern American.\n\nMagnussen\u2019s tenure at Gorham did not last long. Presumably with sales of his modern designs waning, he left the firm in 1929. The following year, writing in Gorham\u2019s An Illustrated History of Silverware Design,William Codman surmised that \u201ca style so called \u2018Modern\u2019 has been introduced to the public, but it does not appear to have made much headway.\u201d Without naming Magnussen, he continued, \u201cIt only remains to be said that the fashion worthy of a place in succession to the best of the Georgian and Colonial periods has yet to be devised.\u201d Upon his departure, Magnussen remained in the United States, teaming up briefly with the New York branch of the German firm of August Dingeldein and Son and then opening his own studios in Chicago and Los Angeles. In 1939 he returned to his native Denmark, remaining until his death in 1961.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On underside of foot rim (fig. 85.2)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">With Catherine Kurland, New York, by 198.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1984.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, A Decade of Decorative Arts: The Antiquarian Society of the Art Institute of Chicago, November 12, 1986\u2013January 4, 1987, pp. 100\u2013101, fig. 80 (ill.).\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Naeve et al.
