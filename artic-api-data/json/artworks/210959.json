    "description": "<p>Roussel was among the founding members of the Chelsea Arts Club in 1891, along with other artists such as James McNeill Whistler, Paul Maitland, Phil May, and Walter Sickert. Sculptor Basil Gotto was soon accepted into membership and later served as chairman from 1913 to 1915. A friend and admirer of Roussel, he was also a collector of his prints and paintings, and around 1902 even helped print some impressions of Roussel\u2019s color etchings. This drypoint image of Gotto\u2014 shown in an early state\u2014was made around the same time as Roussel\u2019s dramatic self-portrait. He began a second portrait of Gotto, intended as a color print, but did not complete the project.</p>\n",
