Types of illumination used: darkfield, differential interference contrast (DIC), and UV. In situ photomicrographs were taken with Wild Heerbrugg M7A StereoZoom microscope fitted with Olympus DP71 microscope digital camera.\n\nSeveral spots on the paintings were analyzed in situ with a Bruker TRACeR III-V with rhodium tube.\n\nSamples were mounted on a Specac diamond compression cell for analysis by FTIR. Data were collected in transmission mode between 4000 and 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> at 4 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution and 128 scans per spectrum using a Bruker Hyperion microscope with MCT D315 detector, interfaced to a Tensor 27 spectrometer bench.\n\nFor in-situ analysis, a Bruker Alpha small footprint portable FTIR spectrometer was used in noncontact, reflection mode.\n\nCross sections were analyzed after carbon coating with Hitachi S-3400N-II VP-SEM with an Oxford EDS and a Hitachi solid-state BSE detector.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software.\n\nOverlay images registered using a novel image-based algorithm developed by Damon M. Conover (GW), Dr. John K. Delaney (GW, NGA), and Murray H. Loew (GW) of the George Washington University\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Don H.
