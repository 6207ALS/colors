A.D. 117\u201338) only accepted the consulship during each of the first three years of his reign, so coins marked COS III can be dated any time after 119. The style helps to date the coin as early in his reign, since the \u201cheroic\u201d portrait still resembles his predecessor Trajan. The similarity to Trajan is not accidental: due partly to the fact that Trajan had not publicly made known his adoption of Hadrian before his death, Hadrian found some resistance to his succession. In addition to the \u201cfamily resemblance\u201d to Trajan (they were not related), the string of names and titles are calculated to hammer home Hadrian\u2019s legitimacy. Accordingly, he is listed on the obverse as Imperator, Caesar, son of Trajan, Augustus. On the reverse, pontifex maximus, holder of tribunician power, and consul for the third time all announced Hadrian\u2019s roles as advocate for all Romans in this world and before the gods.\n\nThe figure on the reverse is the goddess Eternity, shown holding the heads of the Sun and the Moon. The Julio-Claudians and even more vehemently the Flavians had emphasized the connections between the eternity of the state and the eternity of the dynasty; although the Julio-Claudians and Flavians were long gone, the idea was so well established that subsequent rulers would be recognized as guarantors of the world order that the goddess Aeternitas had established through Augustus. Hadrian built on the idea, formalizing the cult of Roma aeterna and adopting urbs aeternae as the title of the city.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">RIC and BMCRE examples have obverse with head right, hint of drapery at left shoulder.\n\nBeckmann, \u201cTrajan and Hadrian,\u201d p. 409.\n\nWhitlark, Resisting Empire, p. 109; Charlesworth, \u201cProvidentia and Aeternitas,\u201d esp. pp. 127\u201331.\n\nFavro, \u201cIconiCITY of Ancient Rome,\u201d p. 36 and n. 72; Pratt, \u201cRome as Eternal,\u201d pp. 28\u201330; Moore, \u201cOn Urbs Eterna et Urbs Sacra,\u201d esp. p. 56; Boatwright, Hadrian and the City of Rome, pp. 120\u201328.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 49 Denarius (Coin) Portraying Emperor Hadrian, A.D. 119/22\n\n</section>",
