    "description": "<p>William Merritt Chase painted numerous versions of fish still lifes, many of which were quickly purchased by museums across the country. Because of the popularity of these works, the artist worried that he would be remembered only \u201cas a painter of fish.\u201d Chase\u2019s training in the Munich style, characterized by scintillating surface texture and careful brushwork, is showcased in <em>North River Shad</em>. Brilliant white strokes form the fish\u2019s iridescent scales, accentuating the weight and density of the voluminous creature at center. The painting is a striking departure from his better-known Impressionist renderings of city parks and other outdoor scenes.</p>\n",
