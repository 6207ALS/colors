    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is Judith, the Old Testament heroine who rescued her people from the Assyrians.  Disarming their general, Holofernes, with her beauty, she entered his tent, encouraged him to drink too much, and then cut off his head.  The painting is by the Flemish artist Jan Sanders van Hemessen, who studied in Italy before settling in the city of Antwerp in the southern Netherlands.  Martha Wolff:</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: For me one of the fascinating things about this picture is the heroic quality of the nude figure of Judith, in contrast to the delicacy of the painting of her hair and of the beautiful silk bag in which she will put the head of the slain Holofernes.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Notice the striking juxtaposition of the transparent veil that floats down from Judith's braided hair with her enemy's severed head.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: The contrast between the muscular figure and these delicate passages really emphasizes the quality of the nude as essentially a male figure with female attributes added to it, and this fits both probably with the experience of the painter in terms of his study of antique sculpture, of Renaissance painting, the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, probably on a trip to Italy that he would have undertaken in the 1520s, and it also fits with the heroic aspect of the figure.</p>\n",
