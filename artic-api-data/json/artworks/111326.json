    "description": "<p>A souvenir of Everett Shinn\u2019s only trip to Europe, <em>The Hippodrome, London</em> is apparently the first oil painting devoted to what would become the artist\u2019s signature subject: popular entertainments such as the circus, vaudeville, and the theater. Shinn\u2019s choice of subject matter and idiosyncratic perspective correspond to French Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works by artists like Edgar Degas and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and also reflect his own theatrical interests and early career as an illustrator for periodicals. The Hippodrome opened in London in January 1900 as a circus and was transformed into a music hall a decade later; it is likely that Shinn attended a performance there during the venue\u2019s first year.</p>\n",
