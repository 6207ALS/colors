    "copy": " In 1904 Danish silversmith Georg Jensen (1866\u20131935) founded one of the world\u2019s most celebrated design companies. Famous for its signature silver tableware that combines gleaming sculptural forms with lush ornament, Jensen\u2019s eponymous firm has stood at the forefront of domestic design for over a century by combining an innovative and experimental spirit with a commitment to traditional craftsmanship. Tracing the evolution of Georg Jensen silver from its place in the company\u2019s initial emergence through its continuing role as a touchstone for the global identity of Danish design, this book examines the creative processes and business practices behind Jensen\u2019s stunning bowls, pitchers, coffee services, and other domestic objects. Lavishly illustrated with works ranging in style from organic to industrial, Georg Jensen is full of new insights gleaned from the company\u2019s own archives and situates Jensen\u2019s work in the broader context of 20th-century design. This unprecedented study includes scholarly essays by Alison Fisher, Maggie Taft, and Thomas C. Thulstrup that delve into the significant and continuing impact of Georg Jensen silver on modern domestic taste.   Edited by Alison Fisher With essays by Alison Fisher, Maggie Taft, and Thomas C.
