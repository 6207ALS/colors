    "description": "<p>This evocative drawing exemplifies George Grosz\u2019s interest in creating symbolic self-portraits. Here we see Grosz himself seated at a table, with a cityscape behind him and a \u201clittle man\u201d before him. During World War I, he often inserted such figures into paintings, drawings, and prints as a means of self-parody and social commentary. In fact, one scholar has suggested that here the \u201clittle man\u201d represents the artist in mannequin form and that therefore the work is a double self-portrait.</p>\n",
