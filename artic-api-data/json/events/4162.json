    "description": "<p>In the 17th century, Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo (now Tokyo) were Japan\u2019s thriving cities, complete with bustling entertainment districts where ukiyo, or the \u201cfloating world,\u201d was born. People of all ranks shared in the enjoyment of the floating world\u2019s attractions\u2014brothels, kabuki theater, and seasonal festivities. Artists of the period captured this popular phenomena in ukiyo-e, or \u201cpictures of the floating world.\u201d Over the last 25 years, Roger Weston has assembled an outstanding collection of ukiyo-e paintings\u2014masterpieces by the most famed artists of the day.&nbsp;</p><p>This exhibition, the first public showing of his comprehensive ukiyo-e painting collection in the United States, showcases the sheer beauty of floating world painting and offers an exclusive view of the urban amusements of early modern Japan. \u201cUkiyo-e painting has an appeal that is so intriguing and special I simply fell in love with the genre,\u201d remarked Roger Weston. \u201cIt has been a true pleasure to assemble a collection that encompasses the full chronology of ukiyo-e and all the major schools. I hope to give visitors the same joy viewing it as I have had building it.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Janice Katz, Roger L. Weston Associate Curator of Japanese Art, will speak on the history and meanings behind Japanese ukiyo-e paintings featured in the exhibition.
