Featured in exhibitions around the globe and in numerous scholarly and popular publications, this part of the museum\u2019s holdings is particularly well known and exceedingly rich. The Art Institute has contributed significantly to the scholarship on its own nineteenth-century collection and on nineteenth-century art in general by organizing groundbreaking exhibitions focused on the material history of particular works, including Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South (2001) and Seurat and the Making of \u201cLa Grande Jatte\u201d (2004).\n\nWe are proud to add to this list the comprehensive, multipart research project Paintings and Works on Paper by Artists of the Impressionist Circle at the Art Institute of Chicago. The first three volumes, focused on Claude Monet (1840\u20131926), Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1848\u20131919), and Gustave Caillebotte (1848\u20131894) were launched in 2014\u201315. After the success of these publications, we are pleased to present the fourth volume, devoted to the museum\u2019s holdings of works by Camille Pissarro (1830\u20131903). Along with Monet and Renoir, Pissarro is well represented at the Art Institute, which owns ten paintings ranging from The Banks of the Marne in Winter, exhibited at the Salon of 1866, to The Place du Havre, Paris (1893), which the artist painted from the window of a grand hotel overlooking a busy intersection. As is the case for our Monet and Renoir works, the earliest paintings by Pissarro to enter the collection were acquired by Bertha Honore Palmer and Potter Palmer from the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris in the early 1890s. The couple\u2019s bequest, made in 1922, included three paintings by the artist: The Place du Havre, Paris; Woman and Child at the Well (1882); and Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1882). Pissarro showed this last canvas in the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882 and considered it among his best pictures, calling it \u201ccareful\u201d and \u201cfinished\u201d in a November 1883 letter to his son Lucien. As if to underscore Pissarro\u2019s own assessment, in 2010 the Art Institute acquired a related drawing through the Regenstein Endowment Fund, making it the first museum to own one of the artist\u2019s large-scale preparatory drawings and the resulting painting.\n\nThe museum\u2019s collection of works by Pissarro has also been expanded by other pivotal gifts and purchases. Foremost among these is The Crystal Palace (1871), donated by Mr. and Mrs. B. E. Bensinger in 1972, an important document of the artist\u2019s self-imposed exile in England during the Paris Commune and one of only two paintings he made of this important structure. In 1999 the Art Institute received a significant work from later in Pissarro\u2019s career, Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (1894/95), as part of the Millennium Gift from the Sara Lee Corporation. Our holdings continue to be enriched, most recently by Dorothy Braude Edinburg\u2019s 2012 gift of the pastel At the Window, rue des Trois-Fr\u00e8res to the Harry B. and Bessie K. Braude Memorial Collection.\n\nFor this publication, we are grateful to have been able to benefit from the expertise of Pissarro scholar Richard R. Brettell, Margaret M. McDermott Distinguished Chair of Art and Aesthetic Studies and Founding Director of the Edith O\u2019Donnell Institute of Art History in Dallas. Dr. Brettell\u2019s lifelong interest in and vast knowledge of the artist\u2019s life and art greatly enriched his curatorial essays. Similarly, the technical examinations made by Assistant Paintings Conservator Kelly Keegan and Associate Paper Conservator Kimberly Nichols, led by Grainger Executive Director of Conservation Frank Zuccari, testify to their thoroughness and high standards. The art-historical and scientific components of the catalogue have mutually enriched each other, producing discoveries that expand our understanding of Pissarro\u2019s working process, life, and art.\n\nThis catalogue truly has been a collaborative endeavor. The curatorial dimension was overseen by Gloria Groom, Senior Curator and David and Mary Winton Green Curator of Nineteenth-Century European Painting and Sculpture, with Genevieve Westerby, Research Associate in the Department of European Painting and Sculpture. The efforts of Sarah Guernsey, Executive Director of Publishing, and Amy Peltz, Editor, have been critical to the success of this project. Amy Parkolap, Production Coordinator in Publishing, and Tina Shah, Senior Systems Analyst in the Department of Digital Information and Access, were vital to the further advances we have made in presenting research in an elegant and easy-to-use digital platform. It is my hope that this catalogue will serve as a practical scholarly resource and an absorbing, detailed history, thus engaging the dedicated specialist and the general art lover alike.  \n\nDouglas Druick  \nPresident and Eloise W.
