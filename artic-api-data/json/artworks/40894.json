The lower portion, in the shape of a  woman\u2019s face, was made in a mold; the shoulder, neck, and mouth of the pitcher were formed on a potter\u2019s wheel; and the handle was fashioned by hand. The woman's flesh and thick, centrally parted hair are the natural color of the clay, but her brows and the contours of her eyes and irises are drawn in black. Her sclerae are white, and her irises are brown.</p>\n",
