    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Amedeo Modigliani painted this double portrait in 1916. Former Director, Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: Modigliani was born and trained in Italy and came to Paris in 1906. Paris, of course, then being the artistic center of vanguard painting.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Modigliani lived in the Bohemian Montparnasse quarter where many young artists congregated.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: They saw each other socially and worked together and became known as the so-called \u201cSchool of Paris\u201d. Many of the artists in the School of Paris shared the fact that they were born outside of France and they also many of them shared the fact that they had a Jewish ancestry and that includes both Modigliani, the painter of this portrait, and Jacques Lipchitz, the sculptor. He\u2019s portrayed here with his recent bride, a Russian poet by the name of Berthe Kitrosser.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Modigliani painted the portrait in his hallmark style flattening the forms of his sitters\u2019 faces and depicting their features with sharp sinuous lines that recall those of carved wooden masks.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This is one of only two double portraits that Modigliani painted. I think it gives us some insight into the couple that he is portraying. For example, Berthe looks to us as a more open, inviting, friendly personality. Lipchitz, himself, faces out towards us, but the expression is much more veiled.</p>\n",
