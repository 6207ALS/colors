    "title": "Without Bounds or Limits: An Online Exhibition of the Plan of Chicago",
    "description": "On July 4, 1909, Daniel H. Burnham and the Commercial Club of Chicago unveiled the culmination of three years of work and a decade of preparation.  The Plan of Chicago, considered a fundamental urban planning document, presented one group\u2019s radical vision for a more beautiful, orderly, and unified city.  And with its lush illustrations and rousing prose, it dared its readers to not only imagine a different Chicago, but to strive to create it themselves. The Plan is remarkable for several reasons.  For one, in the wake of industrialization and an influx of population (including many immigrants), it refined the meaning of prosperity in a growing city, probing the quality of urban life there. The Plan also discerned Chicago\u2019s broader interconnectivity with cities across the Midwest, considering the city\u2019s impact on the surrounding plains and encouraging a more regional approach. But perhaps the most striking\u2014and uniquely American\u2014aspect of the Plan was its idealistic belief in Chicago as a city without limits.  The planners believed their city could become the most beautiful and prosperous in the world, and they inspired its citizens to undertake the challenge. This exhibition presents a selection of original drafts, letters, meeting minutes, and images related to the Plan of Chicago, from the collections at the Ryerson & Burnham Archives at the Art Institute of Chicago.",
