The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. A stamp from the color merchant Troisgros Fr\u00e8res was documented on the back of the original stretcher. A warp-thread match was detected with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv.), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37 [W1628], inv. 1933.441), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The painting is densely built up from a light-toned underpainting that laid out the main forms of the composition. In the process of painting, the artist made a significant change to the placement of the two stacks. At an earlier stage, the stacks appear to have been of a size comparable to those depicted in the final painting but were placed much further apart, closer to the left and right edges of the canvas. The horizon line also appears to have been painted in a significantly lower position in the earlier image. Some of the brushwork related to the earlier painting remains visible on the surface. The date, 91, appears to have been applied later and in a different color from the signature, after some pink brushstrokes added to the bottom right corner covered the original date.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 29.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 91 (lower right, name in reddish-brown paint, date in greenish-brown paint) (fig. 29.2, fig. 29.3, fig. 29.4). The signature is executed in a reddish-brown paint and was applied when the underlying paint was dry. The date, on the other hand, consists of a dull, greenish-brown paint mixture and appears to have been added later, wet-in-wet, over a layer of pale-pink paint that was applied just to the corner area and that appears to cover an earlier date similar in color to the signature (fig. 29.5).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 100 cm, which corresponds to a no. 40 seascape (marine) standard-size stretcher.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.3V (0.5) \u00d7 22.2H (0.7) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was determined with seven other Monet paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 1933.444), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (cat. 32 [W1284], inv. 1983.166), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37 [W1628], inv. 1933.441).\n\nThere is mild cusping along the top and bottom edges, slightly more pronounced cusping on the left edge, and stronger and more irregular cusping along the right edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1992 treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced approximately 2\u20135 cm apart. The painting appears to have been mounted on the stretcher slightly askew. Additional holes on all sides probably relate to the aluminum strip molding applied in 1959 (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes, spaced approximately 6\u20138 cm apart, correspond to cusping in the canvas. A second series of tack holes is spaced more irregularly, approximately 5\u201310 cm apart, and does not align with the cusping pattern.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-membered wood stretcher with vertical crossbar and keyable mortise and tenon joints, dating to the 1992 treatment (see Conservation History). Depth: 3 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1968-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. A diagram in the 1959 examination report indicates that the stretcher consisted of five members including a vertical crossbar, with keyable, butt-ended joints. Depth: Based on the presence of a crease in the tacking margin, presumably where excess fabric was folded over the back edge of the original stretcher, the depth was approximately 1.5 cm.\n\nThe 1959 examination report records that there was a stamp on the back of the pre-1968-treatment stretcher (discarded): TROT [sic] . . . (?)OS FR\u00c8RES / 35 Rue Victor Mass\u00e9 / Panneaux etc (fig. 29.6).\n\nIn UV light, evidence of a light blue fluorescence between the canvas and the ground suggests the presence of an organic layer, possibly glue sizing (fig. 29.7).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground consists of a single layer and ranges from approximately 15 to 80 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 29.8).\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark particles visible under magnification (fig. 29.9).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following components: lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of bone black, iron oxide, alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nMost of the landscape and the left side of the sky were executed in similarly soft shades of blue and pink, sometimes mixed to form pale-purple hues. These colors appear throughout these areas, but in general, pink was used for the reflections in the snow and a slightly more intense blue to denote the shadows. The artist worked in a fairly narrow tonal range, such that the transition from foreground to middle ground to sky is almost indistinguishable and the buildings in the distance are barely discernible. The stacks come into sharper focus through the use of more intensely colored strokes of blue and reddish-brown paint. The most intense color\u2014shades of bright yellow, orange, and salmon pink (fig. 29.10)\u2014were reserved for the evening sky. The paint layer is fairly continuous, with very little exposed ground visible at the surface. The dense buildup of paint is evident in both the transmitted light and X-ray images (fig. 29.11). Where a few small glimpses are afforded, there appears to be a light-toned underpainting that covers most of the ground layer. This often consists of pale shades of gray (fig. 29.12) or, underneath the stacks, subdued greens and pinkish browns (fig. 29.13, fig. 29.14). The brush-marked texture of this underpainting often remains visible on the surface of the painting.\n\nThe brushwork is relatively uniform over the surface. Brush marks are visible, but they are low relief and smoothed out in places, with very little impasto. The paint consistency ranges from quite fluid, exhibiting a smooth, settled surface with some swirling together of unmixed colors (fig. 29.15), to stiffer, more-bodied paint that holds the ridges of the brush marks (fig. 29.16). The painting combines areas of wet-in-wet mixing and wet-over-dry brushwork. In some areas, the artist used a scumbling technique in which he layered opaque, slightly more intense color on top of a lighter paint layer. This is apparent in the orange area of the sky, where deep orange-red paint was applied wet-over-dry with a small brush (2.0\u20133.0 mm in width), using short strokes that allow the pale orange layer underneath to show through (fig. 29.17). A similar effect was observed in the bluish-gray hill near the left edge (fig. 29.18). The light dragging of the upper paint layers here and throughout the painting emphasizes the texture of the underlying layers. This is particularly apparent in the areas of compositional changes (discussed below).\n\nTechnical examination has revealed a major compositional change in the placement of the two stacks. As is evident in both the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images, earlier in the painting process the stacks were positioned much farther apart (fig. 29.19). Although the sizes of both the large and the small stack seem comparable to those in the final painting, their outer edges were much closer to the left and right sides of the canvas, which would have left quite a large empty space in the middle of the composition. Brushstrokes from the earlier stacks, particularly the thicker strokes that delineate the edges, remain visible on the surface, especially when the painting is viewed in raking light (fig. 29.20). It is difficult to say how far these stacks were developed or whether they were painted in a different palette, since the paint applied on top is mostly continuous. In a few small areas of the large painted-out stack, however, some green paint was observed below the surface (fig. 29.21). A similar green area was detected below the pink and blue paint of the landscape at the left edge of the painting (fig. 29.22), perhaps providing evidence that the artist started the painting using a different color scheme. The artist may also have adjusted the position of the horizon line. There are some strong, roughly horizontal, curving brushstrokes above and below the current horizon, on the left and right sides of the painting. These are more clearly visible in the X-ray, which shows similar brushstrokes continuing throughout the sky. Based on this evidence, it seems that the horizon line may have originally been significantly lower, possibly with the peak of the large painted-out stack rising slightly above it (fig. 29.23).\n\nA band of disturbed paint\u2014caused by something having been pressed onto and then pulled away from the paint surface when it was still wet, drawing up low peaks\u2014occurred along the bottom edge. The band is approximately 45 cm long and is positioned roughly in the middle of the canvas (29 cm from the left edge and 27 cm from the right edge) (fig. 29.24). This impression in the wet paint may have been caused by an easel cleat or transporting device. Subsequent brushstrokes were applied on top when the peaks of paint were dry, indicating that the disturbance to the wet paint occurred at some point during the execution of the work. A few inclusions, possibly of plant matter, were observed embedded in the paint layer, near the bottom-right corner (fig. 29.25).\n\nBrushes including 0.3, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint surface.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. UV fluorescence suggests the use of red lake throughout the landscape.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1992 and left unvarnished. It has a subtly variable surface\u2014matte in some areas, low sheen in others\u2014depending on the qualities of the paint. It is noted in the conservation file that the painting was cleaned and varnished in 1922. Its surface finish prior to this treatment was not documented (see Conservation History).\n\nThe painting was cleaned and varnished in 1922.\n\nIn 1954 the stretcher was keyed out to ameliorate slackening of the canvas.\n\nAround 1959 the painting was surface cleaned with wax emulsions and backed with resin-coated paper board, and aluminum strip molding was attached along the edges.\n\nIn 1968 a \u201cvery heavy, yellowed\u201d varnish was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and mounted on a new ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Minor inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 1992 the wax-resin lining was removed. The canvas was edge lined and mounted on a new keyable wood stretcher with a loose lining. The synthetic varnish layers were removed, and the painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is edge lined and loose lined with a panel insert. There are no planar deformations. Moderate cracking, abrasion, and small losses are present in the paint and ground layers around all of the edges, with some short splits in the canvas at the foldovers and holes at the corners. The paint layer is in excellent condition, with only a few tiny flake losses. There is minimal retouching, mostly at the top, left, and right edges. There is an overall network of fine cracks. Cracking is more extensive in the sky, but is visible mostly only under magnification. Stretcher-bar cracks are visible in the area of the original vertical crossbar. A few anomalous brown and gray paint strokes near the bottom left corner have the appearance of smudges or accretions but are probably original to the painting, since they appear to be wet-in-wet with the surrounding paint. There is some flattening of the paint and embedded wood fibers and debris in the frame rebate area, which appears to be due to framing when the paint was still soft. Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint surface. There are some light scratches and gouges in the blue paint at the bottom left corner and also to the right of the large stack, which occurred when the paint was still soft. The painting is currently unvarnished and has a natural matte finish with slight variations in gloss depending on the qualities of the paint. Some yellowed, natural-resin varnish residues and starch-paste residues from previous treatments are visible microscopically in the recesses of the paint texture. In places, these residues scatter the light and impart a whitish, milky appearance at certain angles. There are traces of gold paint in the frame rebate area.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame with carved acanthus leaves divided by an undulating ribbon, inner guilloche ornament bordered by hollows, and leaf-tip sight edge (Paul Mitchell Ltd., London 1995). The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso. The hollows are burnished while the ornament is selectively burnished. The gilding is toned with thin washes of oil paint and glue size. The carved jelutong-wood molding is mitered and joined with dovetail splines. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is quirked ogee cyma recta; convex face with carved acanthus leaves divided by an undulating ribbon; fillet with rocked recutting; hollow; guilloche bordered by rocked recutting; hollow; torus with carved leaf tips; and cove sight (fig. 29.26).\n\nPrevious frame (a note on a 1969 loan request states the work \u201cwas re-framed in 1968 August\u201d; removed 1995): The work was previously housed in an American mid-twentieth-century reproduction of a Louis XVI, gilt, architrave frame with ribbon-and-reel and bead-and-bobbin ornament (APF Inc., New York) (fig. 29.27, fig. 29.28).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, July 20, 1891, for 3,200 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Oct. 30, 1891.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, Feb. 29, 1892, for $13,000.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Claude Monet, May 1891, cat. 13, as Meules.

The Art Institute currently uses the title that resulted from the research for the exhibition 1995 exhibition Claude Monet (1840\u20131926) and from consulting several Monet scholars. See Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, Mar. 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. This painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nJuly 20, 1891: Meules, effet de neige, soleil couchant (Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1891\u20131901 [no. 1075]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 5, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nFeb. 29, 1892: Meules, effet de neige, soleil couchant (Durand-Ruel, New York, stock book for 1888\u20131893 [no. 847]; see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 5, 2013, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago).\n\nMar. 1905: Meules. Effet de Neige, Soleil Couchant. 1891 (Copley Society of Boston, Loan Collection of Paintings by Claude Monet and Eleven Sculptures by August Rodin, exh. cat. [Copley Society, 1905], p. 26, cat 84).\n\nThe painting was dated 1890/91 by James N. Wood and Douglas Druick; see Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, March 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. This range includes the inscribed date of 1891 and allows for the possibility that Monet began the painting in 1890.\n\nFor further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPLM and XRF analysis indicate that the reddish-brown paint mixture contains vermilion, red lake, ultramarine blue, lead white, cadmium yellow, and viridian; and that the greenish-brown paint mixture contains lead white, vermilion, red lake, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, cadmium yellow, and viridian. Other pigments may also be present. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_431\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Dec. 17, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stacks\\_22\\_431\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe first number of the earlier date looks like a 9; the second number is more obscured, but could be a 1. The repainting of the date could have been a function of Monet \u201cfinishing\u201d the corner rather than making any kind of deliberate change to the original date. As observed in several other Monet paintings examined for this project, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a more sketchy state, with areas of ground left exposed. John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171, notes that \u201cMonet\u2019s stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 . . . insisted on several occasions that, in the studio, \u2018[Monet] signed his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_431\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 19, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (W1278/1922.431),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1231, W1269, W1270, W1278, W1284, W1397, W1475, W1628,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_431\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 19, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of early dealer labels (including Durand-Ruel) on the previous stretcher suggests that the stretcher may have been original or was added very early in the painting\u2019s lifetime (see Labels and Inscriptions).\n\nSee Anton Konrad, examination report, Nov. 9, 1959, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee notes on back of Anton Konrad, examination report, Nov. 9, 1959, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. The stamp is undoubtedly from the color merchant Troisgros Fr\u00e8res, which operated at this address in 1888\u201399, according to St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 49\u201367. Given that stamps from Troisgros Fr\u00e8res and its predecessor Vieille &amp; Troisgros were documented on the back of the canvas of several other Art Institute Monet paintings, and in the absence of any photodocumentation, it should perhaps be questioned whether this stamp was actually on the stretcher, or whether it may have been on the canvas, the distinction not having been made when it was transcribed along with the labels from the stretcher. The canvas was lined in 1968 (see Conservation History); no evidence of a canvas stamp was observed when the painting was viewed with transmitted light.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_431\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" Dec. 19, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF.

Bubble holes were observed throughout the paint layers, which can be related to mixing of the paints, for example, when incorporating medium or solvent. This hypothesis was not investigated scientifically.\n\nThis earlier arrangement may have been somewhat similar to the composition of Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (1890/91; 1933.444 [W1270]), which was also painted on a no. 40 seascape (marine) canvas. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThis perhaps provides tangible evidence of Monet having worked on the painting outdoors. Similar plant matter was also observed embedded in the paint layers of Poppy Field, Giverny (1891; 1922.4465 [W1253]) and The Customs House at Varengeville (1897; 1933.1149 [W1455/]). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, viridian, and cobalt blue (PLM, XRF), chrome yellow, red lake, and ultramarine blue (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

The stamp is undoubtedly from the color merchant Troisgros Fr\u00e8res, which operated at this address from 1888 to 1899, according to St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), pp. 49\u201367. Given that stamps from Troisgros Fr\u00e8res and its predecessor Vieille &amp; Troisgros were documented on the back of the canvas of several other Art Institute Monet paintings, and in the absence of any photodocumentation, it should perhaps be questioned whether this stamp was actually on the stretcher, or whether it may have been on the canvas, the distinction not having been made when it was transcribed along with the labels from the stretcher. The canvas was lined in 1968; no evidence of a canvas stamp was observed when the painting was viewed with transmitted light.\n\nThis label probably corresponds to the Copley Society, Boston, exhibition, Loan Collection of Paintings by Claude Monet and Eleven Sculptures by Auguste Rodin, Mar. 1905.\n\nSee Don H.
