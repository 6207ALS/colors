    "title": "The Image Reappears: Discovering the Origins of a Puzzling Dal\u00ed",
    "copy": " The painting known to visitors for many years as Visions of Eternity has been a cornerstone of the Art Institute\u2019s collection of modern and contemporary art since the 1980s. The largest of the museum\u2019s paintings by Dal\u00ed, it was recently cleaned and freed of overpaint and varnish in preparation for the exhibition Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears , now open in Gallery 289. It also sports a new frame. But perhaps more surprising, it has a new title: Untitled (Dream of Venus) . The creation date, too, has been updated, from 1936 to 1939. The reason for these changes constitutes one of the most significant discoveries around Dal\u00ed\u2019s work in decades.   When we began planning for the exhibition, the first-ever show here dedicated solely to Dal\u00ed, one of our goals was to learn as much as possible about his practice directly from the works in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. This sort of object-based study, often undertaken in advance of exhibitions or major gallery rotations, is especially satisfying when we have a deep reservoir of works to consider, as is the case with Dal\u00ed. Through close looking and research, and by combing the extensive archival documentation in our object files, we gained a deeper understanding of how Dal\u00ed created pictures in the early 1930s. These included smaller-scale works like Untitled (Desert Landscape) and the diminutive Portrait of Gala with Two Lamb Chops in Equilibrium upon Her Shoulder as well as easel paintings of the mid-1930s such as A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano and Inventions of the Monsters , which Dal\u00ed created using his \u201cparanoiac-critical method.\u201d   The painting then known as Visions of Eternity quickly stood out as incongruous with the other works of its time. Some of these differences were plainly visible, such as its relatively large scale and sense of composition. While other works in the collection made by Dal\u00ed in 1936 were dense with figures, painted with tightly detailed brushwork that invited intimate viewing from just a few inches away, this work featured an uncharacteristically empty expanse and loose brushwork that seemed best taken in from a distance of many feet. When our colleagues in Conservation and Science examined it more closely\u2014using a microscope, infrared technology, and X-ray fluorescence\u2014the differences in paint application were so vast that they made us question what we thought we knew about the painting.   So we went back to fundamentals. Examining the object\u2019s files, we discovered that earlier generations of Art Institute curators had been curious about this work\u2019s past too. When the painting entered the museum\u2019s collection in 1987 as a gift from Joseph and Jory Shapiro, it arrived with relatively little information about its history prior to their purchase of the work decades earlier. Hoping to build on our existing knowledge, we moved on to archives, both in and outside of the museum, contacted representatives of gallerists and art dealers, and sought expertise from a network including the Gala-Salvador Dal\u00ed Foundation in Figueres, Spain.   As conservator Allison Langley began cleaning the painting in preparation for this exhibition, she noticed curious physical aspects atypical for Dal\u00ed, such as the way the canvas had been cut, folded, and rolled before its arrival here. What in the history of this work could have accounted for such treatment? Given the painting's unique imagery, scale, and physical characteristics, we began to consider whether it may have been created for a context outside of traditional gallery presentation. Might it have been a kind of theatrical backdrop, for example\u2014perhaps for ballet or film? Then came a fateful moment in the library. Leafing through a 1939 issue of Vogue magazine intended for display in the exhibition, we noticed a feature illustrating Dal\u00ed\u2019s design for his Dream of Venus pavilion at the New York World\u2019s Fair. A downcast figure at the far right appeared similar to the figure in Visions of Eternity, who walks with a bundle over his shoulder and casts a long shadow. Perhaps, we thought, the painting was made not in 1936 but closer in time to the pavilion project of 1939.   Dedicated to the theme of Venus from antiquity to the present, Dal\u00ed\u2019s funhouse for the 1939 World\u2019s Fair helped bring Surrealism to the attention of a broader popular audience in the United States. Set within the fair\u2019s \u201camusements zone,\u201d the pavilion had the look of an art nouveau grotto and was divided into \u201cwet\u201d and \u201cdry\u201d chambers. On the \u201cwet\u201d side was a functional aquarium with burlesque models swimming as mermaids, while on the \u201cdry\u201d side Dal\u00ed created an installation densely filled with large-scale found-object sculptures and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. A mural served as a backdrop to the scene and featured some of the best-known imagery from Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings. Reviewing period photographs of the pavilion in detail\u2014including a few from our own collection\u2014curator Jennifer Cohen found in one image, to our shock and delight, the same imagery depicted in our Visions of Eternity painting. But was this simply an image of our painting, or could it be the actual painting itself?   In addition to the strange folds mentioned above, our colleagues in Conservation and Science identified several physical features of the painting that suggested it had in fact originated as part of the larger pavilion mural. Because the mural was not mounted on a traditional stretched canvas, they could begin to explain why our painting today has no tacking edges and why it shows evidence of having been cut on three sides as well as rolled and folded. As Langley explains, \u201cThere is a prominent fold line that now makes more sense\u2014it aligns with the top edge of the painting as it was installed in the pavilion. Some curious circular paint marks in the lower-right quadrant of the painting, which are clearly visible on the surface, must be early outlines for the edge of the clock\u2019s shadow\u2014I could never quite explain their presence previously. And the presence of nail holes along only the left edge now makes sense as well; they\u2019re from the original mounting.\u201d   The deep, collaborative research carried out by the exhibition\u2019s curatorial and conservation teams has resulted in one of the most significant findings in Dal\u00ed scholarship in many years. This revelatory connection is presented for the first time in our galleries as part of Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears , where you can see Untitled (Dream of Venus) installed alongside photographs and archival materials that highlight the relationship between the painting and the pavilion that contained it. We invite you to learn more about this discovery at a special lecture on March 25, where, joined by conservators Allison Langley and Katrina Rush, we will discuss our research process and the significance of these findings in detail. \u2014Caitlin Haskell, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator, Modern and Contemporary Art, and director, Ray Johnson Collection and Research; and Jennifer Cohen, curator, provenance and research ",
