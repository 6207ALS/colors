    "description": "<p>The Benjamin Galleries opened in Chicago in 1939 under the direction of Chicago dentist Dr. Benjamin Krohn (1904-1957), an accomplished painter in his own right. Dr. Krohn\u2019s goal was to sell good art in a broad price range in an informal setting. To this end, the Gallery\u2019s first location was in Dr. Krohn\u2019s apartment at 222 E. Ontario, and later moved to his second apartment at 154 E. Superior Street. Dr. Krohn initially exhibited School of Paris artists; at the outset of World War II, he began to feature local artists, including Gertrude Abercrombie, Ellen Lanyon, Eleanor Coen, Aaron Bohrod, and Roland Ginzel. After Krohn\u2019s death his wife Neva continued to operate the gallery, now at 900 N. Michigan Avenue, and exhibited established American painters and sculptors until she sold the business in 1979. This collection includes papers and photographs documenting the operations of the gallery as well as correspondence with artists represented by the business.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Benjamin%20Galleries%20Records/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
