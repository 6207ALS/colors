    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This picture of a reclining woman by Fernand L\u00e9ger speaks to what is often referred to as \u201cthe return to order\u201d in French painting in the years following the First World War. Traumatized by the cataclysm that was World War I many of the artists, reflecting the people in French society, desired a return to more enduring values. It\u2019s expressed by L\u00e9ger in this picture by the way he balances the composition, horizontals and verticals, creating a stable visual field, but even more importantly by the subject.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The female nude is a traditional subject in the history of art, reaching back through the Renaissance to antiquity.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: But what he has done is he\u2019s taken a traditional subject, a classical subject if you wish, and he has modernized it because he has seen the figure through the lens of contemporary life and notably the technological advances that were part of contemporary society. The figure is composed of component parts which suggest even machine parts. For L\u00e9ger modern life and the new industrial age in which he was living were a promise for a better future.</p>\n",
