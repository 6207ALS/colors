He used light pencil strokes to place the figure and such surrounding elements as the bench, pathway, and plants. He followed with multiple, repeated lines to build up the shapes and forms. The artist expressed volume minimally through contour rather than light and shadow. The little shading Matisse applied consists of loose parallel lines in the skirt and on the ground beside the figure. He made adjustments by erasing and shifting the position of the woman\u2019s head, facial features (see fig. 27.1), and proper right leg, and the right edge of her skirt. He also erased and moved the vertical branch of a bush behind her. Other minor erasures can be seen within the figure\u2019s body and clothing. Matisse drew up to the edges of the sheet.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 27.2).\n\nGraphite with erasing.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. There is a partial watermark located in the lower part of the right edge: [ ]T ARCHES (1.8 \u00d7 11.5 cm) (fig. 27.3).\n\nThe top and right have a deckle edge; the bottom and left edges appear hand torn but may retain partial deckles. Graphite extends onto the edges of the paper, indicating the sheet has not been reduced in size since Matisse created the drawing. For an image of the verso, see fig. 27.4.\n\n38.8 \u00d7 27.9 cm (15 1/4 \u00d7 11 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2015 to repair a minor tear, reduce surface soil at the upper corners, and minimize cockling at the corners.\n\nThere are a few scattered foxing spots. The graphite is slightly smudged throughout, likely the result of the artist\u2019s working process.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly Albert Roullier Gallery, Chicago.\n\nSold to Robert Allerton, Monticello, Ill., by Nov. 25, 1925.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 25, 1925.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 1035, as Woman with Shawl.\n\nSanta Barbara Museum of Art, Nineteenth Century French, American, and English Drawings, Lent by the Art Institute of Chicago, 1947, no cat.\n\nJacksonville, Ill., Pfeiffer Library, MacMurray College, Exhibition of Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Drawings from the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 1947, no cat.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Institute of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, ed.
