The first major exhibition in over 15 years devoted to Dom\u00e9nikos Theotok\u00f3poulos, known widely as El Greco, Ambition and Defiance foregrounds the artist\u2019s personality to chart the development of his distinctive style, offering a new view of his prescient aesthetic. The exhibition is organized by the Art Institute with the R\u00e9union des mus\u00e9es nationaux\u2013Grand Palais, Paris and the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre.   Remaining true to El Greco\u2019s character, Ambition and Defiance provides a window into the personal aspirations and struggles that drove his artistic trajectory. Born in Crete, El Greco trained as a traditional Byzantine icon painter before moving in 1567 to Venice, where he became an avid follower of artists such as Titian and Tintoretto. Mastering but personalizing the techniques of Venetian Renaissance painting, he later sought patronage within the papal circle in Rome, but his ambitions would ultimately be undermined by his outspoken criticism of Michelangelo. El Greco received no commissions from the church during the six years he spent in Rome from 1570 to 1576, building his reputation instead on the basis of occasional commissions for portraits and small-scale devotional paintings.   Ambition and Defiance tracks the intersections of El Greco\u2019s professional savvy, rebellious spirit, and artistic reinvention, culminating in the proto-modern style he developed in Toledo, where he settled in 1577. There, El Greco quickly earned a major commission for the altarpiece of the Church of Santo Domingo el Antiguo, anchored by the monumental masterpiece The Assumption of the Virgin (1577-79), a work acquired by the Art Institute in 1906 at the behest of Mary Cassatt. When a dispute over the price El Greco demanded for another major commission for Toledo Cathedral led to litigation and a fallout with this powerful institution, he embarked on a career as a portraitist of the local intelligentsia. El Greco\u2019s aesthetic continued to transform, becoming otherworldly and deeply expressive, marked by dramatic, bold color, radical foreshortening, and elongated forms. Its distinctly modern tenor appealed to artists at the turn of the twentieth century, when El Greco\u2019s oeuvre was rediscovered and championed by the avant-garde.   The exhibition is organized by Rebecca J. Long, Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Associate Curator of European Painting and Sculpture before 1750. Long has chosen a unique narrative, noting that \u201cwhile El Greco has traditionally been considered through the lens of religious art, we find that a far more clear view of him can be gained through the lens of patronage. He was a striver. His particular career trajectory and artist goals have therefore been our focus. This is the first time El Greco has been the subject of an exhibition at the Art Institute\u2014it\u2019s also the first time his work has been considered in this way in any exhibition.\u201d   Following his relocation from Greece to Italy and on to Spain in pursuit of an artistic career, Ambition and Defiance showcases the development of El Greco\u2019s signature style, highlighting the dramatic aesthetic shifts spurred in large part by the artist\u2019s character and convictions.
