Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, and then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis hand-colored, third-state impression of Noa Noa (Fragrant) is an example of a number that were printed in a later phase of the carving and compositional development of the block, for which the artist adhered two sheets of absorbent Japanese paper together to obtain a surface that accommodated applications of watercolor brushed over printing ink. Noa Noa was likely the first to be printed and toned among the group of hand-colored impressions found within the Noa Noa Suite as Gauguin was working out his paper selections vis-\u00e0-vis his media choices for the suite. This impression is very similar in palette and execution to impressions of Te po (The Night) (cat. 52.1), L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54.2), and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.2) in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. Printed on a single sheet of Japanese paper, this impression may predate the idea of laminating two sheets together. However, because the wove paper used for Noa Noa is similar to that used for the three other impressions noted above, and because the papers delaminate so easily, it is likely that this single sheet was once a laminate of two sheets that were later separated.\n\nOverall, the hand-colored impressions have a more luminous quality, which is enhanced by the translucency of the Japanese papers. It is this very quality that likely appealed to Gauguin when working with delicate washes of color. The end results are certainly aesthetically quite different from those impressions in which transferred media predominate. By comparison, impressions colored by the transfer of waxy, resinous media were instead printed on much sturdier papers.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 51.2.2).\n\nThe wood block was lightly and unevenly inked in black so that only the highest points of the block received the black ink. This created a reticulated surface texture overall. The carbon black ink was applied over some residual brown ink (a mixture of carbon black, vermilion, and chrome yellow or chrome orange) that remained in the interstices of the block after printing the impression that immediately preceded the printing of this one. Gauguin then hand colored the print with a range of watercolors. Watercolors including blue, light blue, several greens, pink, orange, peach, pale red, and dark gray were washed over the printed image (fig. 51.2.3). Ultramarine blue was used to tone the tree trunk and its shadow in the center of the composition. A lighter cerulean blue was used in the sky in the background, which was increasingly diluted as the artist worked up from the middle ground to the background. No fewer than three different tones of green were used. A bright viridian green was used in the horizontal band of ground behind the two figures, in the shirt of the figure in the foreground, and in the clump of trees behind the figure on the right (fig. 51.2.4). Cerulean blue and cadmium yellow were mixed to make a deeper green that was used in the clump of trees and in the bunch of hanging fruit (unripe bananas, perhaps) in the center of the composition (fig. 51.2.5). Yet, the most intriguing tonal passages are those where cadmium yellow has degraded and is no longer visible due to fading and alteration of the pigment over time (fig. 51.2.6). This yellow tone would have appeared in the three lobes that dominate the top of the composition and in a passage to the far right in the clump of trees. Today, what are left of the cadmium yellow washes visually appear as golden-toned passages that can easily be mistaken for staining.\n\nDilute black watercolor washes that appear as strokes of dark gray were used to delineate the dog in the foreground (fig. 51.2.7) and the head of the figure on the left. Pale-orange watercolor (a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow or chrome orange) defines the wavy lines in the foreground. Peach watercolor (a mixture of vermilion and cadmium yellow) appears in the bodies of both figures in the foreground and in the smaller figures in the lobes above. Traces of pale-orange washes in the figures and in the deeply gouged form along the left edge are also a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow or chrome orange. The final color in the artist\u2019s palette, a very pale, dilute vermilion, was used in the hut, in the skirt of the figure on the left (fig. 51.2.8), in the upper portion of the body of the figure on the right, and in the ground in front of her.\n\nThe paper is a thin, fibrous, ivory Japanese paper. It has a translucent quality, with long fibers evenly distributed throughout. Transmitted-light examination confirms that the fiber distribution is even and homogeneous. The fibrous quality of the paper is enhanced in raking light. There is very little sizing in the sheet, and it is soft and smooth to the touch. The watercolors readily wicked through the absorbent paper to the back of the sheet (fig. 51.2.9).\n\nIn raking light creases and cockling become more pronounced, and a series of very fine creases that formed during the printing process are visible. These appear in and around the legs of the figure on the right, and between the N and O of the first NOA in the inscription at the top. It is also possible that these creases formed during a lamination process in which this sheet was adhered to another, now-lost, sheet of Japanese paper, as are others in the group of hand-colored prints found within the Noa Noa Suite. Gauguin may have decided to limit the use of these Japanese paper laminates for his hand-colored impressions (see also cat. 52.1).\n\n354 \u00d7 203 mm (image); 357 \u00d7 206 mm (sheet). Note that there is a two-millimeter discrepancy in the dimensions of both image and sheet in the horizontal direction when compared to other impressions of Noa Noa, even though all were printed from the same block. This is a result of the expansion of the Japanese paper when it was dampened for printing and later dried and flattened.\n\nThis impression of Noa Noa is not a second-state impression, nor does it fit the description of a third-state impression as previously published in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9. Instead, this is a newly discovered, unpublished intermediary state that was printed between the published second and third states. There are numerous areas where this impression differs from the second-state impression (fig. 51.2.10). The bottommost line in the foreground to the left has been extended a quarter inch farther to the right. Additional lines have been added to the base of the tree trunk. A series of fine parallel horizontal lines were added behind the figure on the right. A series of fine parallel vertical lines were added along the right on the ground in front of this figure. To the left of this figure, various additional lines were added to the distant tree and hut. A series of horizontal parallel lines were added along the right side of the forward figure\u2019s skirt. Additional lines were added to the hanging fruit held by this figure.\n\nIt is important to note that these additions were not deeply incised into the block. This afforded Gauguin the opportunity to remove them by gently sanding and smoothing the block locally in areas that he wished to rework. As his efforts on the block progressed, the most noticeable changes involve both the broadening of some of the fine lines described above and the elimination of others by sanding them and smoothing the block to arrive at the fourth and final state of Noa Noa (see fig. 51.2.10 and cat. 51.3).\n\nGauguin\u2019s choice of a fibrous, ivory-toned Japanese paper to print this impression of Noa Noa was intentional since he knew that the fibrous paper was absorbent and would readily accept the watercolor medium. Against the light paper tone, the colors would have appeared quite vibrant. With them, Gauguin better defined the haunches of the dog and added color to numerous printed passages to better define and separate the foreground, middle ground, and background. Over time, with exposure to light, the watercolor passages on the front of the print have faded significantly. The vibrancy of the colors selected by the artist is still evident on the verso, where the watercolor remains less faded in some areas and completely unfaded in others (fig. 51.2.1).\n\nThe hand-colored print was conserved in anticipation of this publication. When discoloration was removed from the sheet, its tone brightened significantly and the colors now appear more vibrant (fig. 51.2.11). Comparison with watercolor passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape [Women at the River] [cat. 59.2]), and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with an ivory hue rather than a golden tone.\n\nIn the upper right and left corners the paper was severely abraded by the removal of old adhesive and paper residues. Residual adhesive along the top of the sheet presumably adhered it to a previous mount. Paper fibers were disrupted; there were small losses and significant cockling at the top as well. In raking light there was a series of four significant diagonal creases that ran from the center of the left edge down to the bottom left of the sheet. Under ultraviolet light residual adhesive and paper residues along the top of the sheet fluoresce lighter and whiter than the paper support. Areas of staining below the dog and the figure on the left appear darker under ultraviolet light. Also, under ultraviolet, spots of snowflake-type foxing have dark centers encircled by bright, white fluorescence. There is a large mended pinhole along the top edge at center. There are two smaller mended pinholes along the bottom edge at center. Given their locations, these were not used for registration purposes; instead, the artist could very well have pinned up the sheet in his studio for display and contemplation. Upon completion of treatment, the structural integrity of the work was restored and its appearance greatly improved.\n\nAlthough some of the watercolor passages remain legible in the wood-block print, all have altered, and some have faded to such a degree that they are no longer legible in the composition. Gauguin\u2019s original palette was much more vibrant and included a range of colors. Most notable among them are yellow passages in the figures and in the deeply gouged area along the center left edge that have faded almost completely, as well as the pronounced alteration of cadmium yellow. Efforts to visually identify watercolor passages are further thwarted by golden-yellow foxing that appears throughout. It is most evident in the immediate foreground and in the branches to the left and right of the central form. The foxing can be seen more clearly on the back of the sheet, where it is not partially obscured by the printing ink.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nBy laminating two sheets of Japanese paper together, Gauguin strengthened the support for printing and for applications of watercolor washes. He made laminated sheets again for the printing of his suite of late wood-block prints several years later.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF, macro-XRF, Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nE.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
