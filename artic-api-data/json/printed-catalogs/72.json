    "copy": " Cy Twombly\u2019s distinctive artworks merge drawing, painting, and symbolic gesture in the pursuit of a direct, intuitive form of expression. Much of the artist\u2019s recent output interprets the natural world, often through references to garden and landscape. Many of these pieces possess a vocabulary of painterly bursts and drips that suggest bloom and decay.   Published in cooperation with the artist, in connection with the inaugural exhibition in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Modern Wing, Cy Twombly: The Natural World, Selected Works, 2000\u20132007 features more than 30 paintings, works on paper, photographs, and sculptures created during the last decade. Highlights include an untitled 2001 series of acrylic and wax crayon works on paper made for Inverlieth House, Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh; an untitled grouping from the 2004 series Winter Pictures; and three notes from the 2005\u201307 series Salalah, inspired by a verdant desert oasis on the coast of the Arabian Sea. Generously illustrated in full color, the catalogue also includes an essay by James Rondeau. Examined together, these recent objects speak to both continuity and innovation in Twombly\u2019s work and underscore the ongoing creative vitality of one of the greatest American artists of our time.   James Rondeau   96 pages, 6 7/8 x 9 3/4 in. 60 color ills. Out of print ISBN: 978-0-300-14691-2 ",
