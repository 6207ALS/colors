Cornelis Saftleven recorded one such rare encounter, capturing the animal\u2019s fur by using a combination of black, brown, and ocher chalk, in some areas (the head and haunches) wetting the media to create denser passages in contrast to the dryer, more disperse use of chalk elsewhere. The addition of ink wash added further shading to suggest the volumes of the camel\u2019s body.</p>\n",
