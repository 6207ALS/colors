    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: On your right stands a machinist, and to the left his apprentice. There's more to these sculptures than might appear at first glance. Here's the Art Institute's Brandon Rude.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: This is a pair created by Emma Stebbins as a complement and a contradiction to each other. They complement each other in that you have an older worker, a sort of father figure, and his younger apprentice. They contradict each other because they're also meant to represent the development of new machinery and new technology, supplanting older machinery and older technology. And this is evident in the old machinist's costume, in his hat, and with the types of tools that he holds. And compared with his young apprentice, who of course is shaven and fresh-cheeked, who holds in his hand a compass and a drawing stylus, meant to represent the introduction of possible new machines and new technology to the labor force.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Emma Stebbins started her career as a painter. But she later became part of an expatriate community of American women sculptors working in Rome. At the time there was much debate about the impact of social and technological change.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE:  Stebbins endows both figures with a sereneness that indicates that the older technology and the newer technology can coexist and complement one another.</p>\n",
