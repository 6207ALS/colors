    "description": "<p>This series of digital vector drawings from photographs addresses what Bani Abidi calls \u201cexclusionary architec-ture,\u201d or structures that, in her words, are \u201cgenerated by heavy doses of fear that we consume daily.\u201d Abidi photo-graphed intercoms found on the front gates of houses in the Defence neighborhood of Karachi\u2014a housing complex built in the 1950s by the Pakistani army to house retired military personnel; it is in what is now one of Karachi\u2019s most affluent areas. These devices mediate between the private space of the powerful and the public space of the increasingly disempowered. Presenting the intercoms as high-tech, seductive forms, Abidi underscores the seeming banality of environments constructed to contain or exclude systemic threat.</p>\n",
