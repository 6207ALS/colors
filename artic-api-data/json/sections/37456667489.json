Ryerson Collection, 1933.1161\n\nIn the summer of 1901 Monet rented a modest house in Lavacourt, located just a few miles from his Giverny property, on the Seine across the river from V\u00e9theuil (fig. 1). It was from the balcony of this rented home that Monet began fifteen paintings of V\u00e9theuil. As exemplified by the two versions in the Art Institute\u2019s collection\u2014one painted in midday and one at sunset\u2014Monet\u2019s goal during this campaign was to depict the same, restricted view of the riverbank and the town\u2019s commanding Church of Notre Dame, but in the differing lights of day.\n\nMonet\u2019s diversion up the Seine that summer\u2014which took place soon after he returned home from his third and final trip to London to paint Charing Cross Bridge, Waterloo Bridge, and the Houses of Parliament (see cats. 38\u201341)\u2014was likely motivated by several factors. Paul Tucker has suggested that Monet found it to be a good alternative to painting his water garden, which was soon to undergo major renovation. In May 1901, Monet had acquired additional land near his Giverny property in order to enlarge his water lily pond, which he initially had built in fall 1893; by late February or early March 1902, Monet had more than tripled its size and had added a miniature island and four flat footbridges. It has been proposed that the extreme heat of Giverny that summer also may have contributed to Monet\u2019s daily visits to his secondary home and studio in Lavacourt. Feeling guilty that he had not sent news in so long, Monet wrote to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, in July about his inability to work in the intense temperatures: \u201cConsidering the heat, it is impossible to work in the studio and outside. It is a year lost. I long for rain and even the cold, so I can get back to work,\u201d Monet explained.\n\nIn addition to a circumstantial decision necessitated by imminent renovation, Monet\u2019s V\u00e9theuil paintings relate to the pursuits he had been exploring in his recent series. In the 1890s, Monet executed serial works of art dedicated to the mutable lighting and atmospheric effects on specific subjects and places\u2014including the Stacks (see cats. 27\u201333), sites along the coast of Normandy (see cat. 35), the banks of the Seine (see cat. 36), and London (see cats. 38\u201341)\u2014that he had treated earlier in his career; according to John House, it was \u201chis recurrent wish to return to sites that he had painted many years before, as if to test out his art and his eye against his previous paintings and memories.\u201d V\u00e9theuil was indeed a location that Monet had painted before, and it was imbued with personal significance, perhaps more than any other spot to which Monet returned. It was in V\u00e9theuil in late summer 1878 that Monet had moved with his family\u2014his first wife Camille and their sons Jean and Michel, the latter then only a few months old\u2014to share a house with Ernest Hosched\u00e9 (an important patron of Monet and the Impressionists until his recent bankruptcy), along with his wife, Alice, and their six children. It was also here that Camille died and was buried in 1879 and that Monet\u2019s relationship with Alice\u2014who would officially become his second wife in 1892\u2014would develop. Until the end of 1881 when Monet, Alice, and their families moved to Poissy, the artist frequently painted V\u00e9theuil, its main roadway, its church and banks, the surrounding landscape, and his own personal garden there, under varying seasons and weather conditions, and often from his studio boat. A few of his numerous canvases of the village depict nearly the same scene as the one featured in the Art Institute\u2019s paintings twenty years later\u2014in varying weather conditions (fig. 2 [W507], fig. 3 [W518], fig. 4 [W533], and fig. 5 [W534]).\n\nA notable difference between Monet\u2019s paintings of V\u00e9theuil from 1901 and those from around 1879 is the format of the canvas used. While the earlier pictures are typically oriented horizontally\u2014the convention for landscapes\u2014Monet\u2019s paintings of V\u00e9theuil from 1901 are all nearly square, a format he had also used in his series Mornings on the Seine (fig. 6, [cat. 36]) and Water Lily Pond (fig. 7, [cat. 37]), works that were executed closer in time. The fact that all fifteen paintings of V\u00e9theuil from 1901 were executed on almost square canvases, which were not a standard format, indicates that Monet probably had to specially request them from his canvas supplier. In the 1901 V\u00e9theuil works as well as his Mornings on the Seine and Water Lily Pond paintings, there is a tripartite division of space into zones of water, land, and sky, with the water\u2014and the effect of light reflecting off of it\u2014given primary importance. Monet seems less preoccupied, however, with the point where water converges with land or air at the horizon in the V\u00e9theuil paintings than is evident in Branch of the Seine near Giverny (fig. 6) and Water Lily Pond (fig. 7). Despite the fact that the two examples in the Art Institute feature strong reflections of V\u00e9theuil in the water, Monet does not explore the same kind of smooth merging of land and reflection. Some of the 1901 V\u00e9theuil paintings, in fact, do not feature reflections of the town in the water at all, and five include indications of land on the bank of the Lavacourt side of the Seine, further breaking up any kind of smooth transition between reality and reflection (see, e.g., fig. 8 [W1636]).\n\nAnother point of interest involves the inclusion of human presence in V\u00e9theuil\u2019s landscape. Some of the paintings from the earlier period when Monet resided in V\u00e9theuil, including The Church at V\u00e9theuil (fig. 9 [W531]), show the hustle and bustle of daily existence around the village. While Monet consistently represented V\u00e9theuil\u2019s built environment in his paintings from 1901, he downplayed the activities of human life, even though, ironically enough, he traveled to the site\u2014often with family and friends in tow\u2014almost every afternoon in the Panhard-Levassor automobile that he had purchased in December 1900. Only a few of the 1901 paintings are populated, and only with passengers in single, isolated, modest-size boats. Although Monet incorporated active, flickering brushstrokes in these canvases, the lack of a human component makes them appear eerily calm and empty. Back in the vicinity of the town where Monet and Camille had spent the final years of their life together, the artist may well have been moved by old memories, which found their expression in the restrained quiet of these pictures.\n\nMonet possibly hoped that his break from Giverny would be productive and beneficial after the considerable difficulty he had experienced finishing the paintings in his London series that he had begun in 1899. As Monet exasperatedly complained to Alice shortly before he returned to Giverny from his final trip to London: \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to continue work on a painting. I make alterations to paintings and often ones that were passable are worse for the change. No one would ever guess the trouble I\u2019d gone through to end up with so little.\u201d But Monet complained that the V\u00e9theuil works, too, caused him more trouble than he anticipated. Writing to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, that October, he expressed: \u201cI have undertaken a series of Views of V\u00e9theuil that I thought I would be able to finish quickly and that have taken me all summer, so all of the other things [I had been working on] remain in progress.\u201d\n\nMonet\u2019s explanation that he had to put aside other canvases in order to focus on the V\u00e9theuil paintings seems curious, however, since technical examination of the two versions of V\u00e9theuil in the Art Institute\u2019s collection suggest that these paintings were by no means as labor intensive as Monet made them out to be. While both were completed in more than one session\u2014as indicated by the presence of wet-over-dry paint application\u2014neither exhibit any major compositional changes (see Technical Report). Furthermore, when both works are examined with transmitted light, they attest to the fact that Monet applied paint rather thinly, leaving areas of the ground layer and canvas texture exposed (fig. 10 and fig. 11), suggesting that he worked quickly and confidently in each session without having to go back and make extensive \u201calterations,\u201d as necessitated in his London series.\n\nPerhaps it was the psychological toll of revisiting V\u00e9theuil, and the attendant memories of his deceased first wife, that made the 1901 V\u00e9theuil paintings take longer than Monet expected. But considering that Durand-Ruel was clamoring for the eleven London canvases he had reserved from Monet back in November 1899, it is possible that Monet fabricated this excuse to justify why he was unable to hand over any of the London works owed to the dealer. In the same letter from October in which Monet complained to Durand-Ruel about the unexpected extra time needed for the V\u00e9theuil views, Monet concluded by referring to the delinquent paintings: \u201cFinally, next week I will take care of finishing some of the old things that you chose and will send them to you soon.\u201d Indeed, the following month Monet was finally able to give four London paintings to Durand-Ruel, but no more would enter the dealer\u2019s hands until their exhibition at the gallery in 1904. Although he began the 1901 V\u00e9theuil works later than the London series, Monet relinquished them more easily. Monet was able to work up a number of them\u2014probably including the two in the Art Institute\u2019s collection\u2014into a finished state by February 1902, when he included them in an exhibition at Durand-Ruel\u2019s rival gallery Bernheim-Jeune.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">V\u00e9theuil (W1643) corresponds to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 4, Nos. 1596\u20131983 et les grandes d\u00e9corations (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 739\u201340, cat. 1643 (ill.).

The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nIn her psychoanalytical treatment of Monet, Mary Gedo has recently argued that the 1901 expansion and redesign of Monet\u2019s pond, in conjunction with his trip to V\u00e9theuil, \u201cwas integrally connected with the death of Camille [Monet\u2019s first wife],\u201d and perhaps was a response to Monet\u2019s \u201coften negligent treatment of her during the final months of life.\u201d Gedo further argued that \u201cMonet\u2019s preoccupation with watery reflections sprang from his reaction to his mother\u2019s death and his ensuing fantasy that he would float forever in the form of a buoy on the surface of the mother/sea . . . the water garden, then, would function as his own symbolic tomb, as well as that of his beloved dead women\u2014his mother, Aunt Lecadre, Camille, and eventually Alice.\u201d See Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), pp. 220, 222\u201324.\n\nMonet to Alice Monet, Mar. 2, 1901, quoted in Richard Kendall, Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters (Macdonald Orbis 1989), p. 192; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 4, Peintures, 1899\u20131926 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1985), p. 355, letter 1611.\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai entrepris une s\u00e9rie de Vues de V\u00e9theuil, que je pensais pouvoir faire rapidement et qui m\u2019a pris tout l\u2019\u00e9t\u00e9, de sorte que toutes les autres choses sont rest\u00e9es en route.\u201d Monet to Paul Durand-Ruel, Oct. 19, 1901, original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 4, Peintures, 1899\u20131926 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1985), p. 359, letter 1644.
