    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The man staring out with such force from this painting is Major General Henry Dearborn, whose name is associated with Fort Dearborn here in Chicago. In fact there are quite a few forts named after him, appropriately for someone who served as Secretary of War under Thomas Jefferson. At the time of this portrait, Dearborn was a senior major general in the army, he was 61 years old, and actively engaged in the War of 1812. The clouds in the background, tinged with red, suggest the smoke and fire of war. The artist has skillfully captured Dearborn's energy and pugnacious attitude. But he's flattered his subject by making him appear merely robust, when in fact the general was quite overweight. The three-quarter profile pose helps to disguise the subject's broken nose and drooping jowls, which are more evident in other portraits. Gilbert Stuart was a successful portraitist, who had studied with Benjamin West in England. When he returned to America, one of this most famous clients was George Washington, whom he painted several times. When you look at a one-dollar bill, it is Gilbert Stuart's portrait of Washington that looks back at you.</p>\n",
