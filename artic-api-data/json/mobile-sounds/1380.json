    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Pablo Picasso lived and worked in his studio called the Bateau-Lavoir in a poor district of Paris around the time he made this picture.  He would have seen mendicants like this gaunt man in the streets surrounding his studio.  As a young man filled with the physical and emotional energies of youth, coming to Paris for the first time, full of artistic ambition, he could not have been blind to the evidence of the frailty of life around him.  One wants to see in this arrangement of seemingly broken anatomical forms, the body of Christ being taken down from the cross and no doubt as a Spanish painter from an intensely Catholic country, those references were not far from Picasso's experience.  The young Picasso would also have been familiar with the work of Spanish masters.  Here, his use of white highlights to emphasize the planes of the skull and the expressiveness of the facial features calls to mind El Greco, an important Spanish painter and someone to whom modern painters looked from Cezanne to Picasso.  So while the young Picasso was certainly taking in the work of his avant-garde contemporaries, he is also recalling the traditions culturally and pictorially of his Spanish homeland.  As you look at a work of art and glance at the label for information about the title of the painting and for the name of the artist and dates, you should also look at the credit line.  In this case, you'll see that this picture came from the Helen Birch Bartlett collection.  To hear more about this extraordinary gift to the Art Institute, press play on your audio guide.</p>\n",
