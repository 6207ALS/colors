In this episode a profoundly lonely spaceman builds a robot and instructs it to give him a Christmas present; the final sequence reveals the scheme\u2019s comic ending. Influenced by Charles Schulz\u2019s treatment of his characters in <em>Peanuts</em>, Ware strives to make the reader \u201cfeel through the character\u201d in his work.</p>\n",
