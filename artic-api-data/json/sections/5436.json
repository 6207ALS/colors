Braude Memorial Collection, 2013.975\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this dancer with light pencil lines and then reinforced the major contours and facial features with heavier, dark lines. He employed parallel hatching to create volume and shadows. Using the point of the pencil he added detail and embellishment to the dress bodice and necklace and shifted the rose down and to the right, erasing the previous position (see fig. 41.1). Matisse made several adjustments and alterations in areas such as the feet, the neck at right, the contour of the head at left, the proper right shoulder, and the outer edges of the skirt. He erased his preliminary lines in all these areas but faint traces remain visible. Pale graphite lines near the lower left corner are illegible. The ivory wove paper has a slight texture, which enlivens the graphite lines.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 41.2).\n\nGraphite with touches of erasing.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, slightly textured, ivory wove paper. There is a very fine screen pattern visible on the recto (fig. 41.3). The top and right edges were hand torn while the left and lower edges were cut. The edges are uneven. For an image of the verso, see fig. 41.4.\n\n28 \u00d7 22.7 cm (11 \u00d7 9 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2015 to address mottled staining and discoloration throughout the sheet. A treatment note in the curatorial file indicates that a crease was relaxed and flattened and a tear mended at the upper left in 2004.\n\nThe paper support exhibits very faint mottled staining throughout. The perimeter is slightly lighter than the rest of the sheet. There is a brown mark, likely a partial fingerprint, near the upper right edge. The graphite surface is in excellent condition.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Knoedler Galleries, London and New York, probably by June 12, 1958.\n\nHarry Spiro (Jan. 12, 1924\u2013Dec. 18, 2001), New York, by Oct. 22, 1973.\n\nUnidentified private collection, Chicago.\n\nJohn Berggruen Gallery, San Francisco, by 1987.\n\nSold to Hirschl and Adler Galleries, New York, 1987.\n\nSold to Thomas Ammann Fine Art, Zurich, from 1987.\n\nSold to an unidentified private collection.\n\nSold to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (c. 1921\u2013Jan. 5, 2015), Sotheby\u2019s London, lot 152, Apr. 4, 1990\u2013June 19, 2013.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 19, 2013.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Probably London, M.
