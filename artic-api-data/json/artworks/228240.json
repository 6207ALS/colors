    "description": "<p>James Bassler is known for visual and technical experimentation as well as for frequent references to the textile of ancient cultures, both American and Asian. Travel in India and Indonesia and extended stays in Mexico encouraged him to employ resist dyeing (both ikat and batik) and off-loom weaving in his work. During a sabbatical in the early 1980s, Bassler learned the wedge-weaving technique practiced by the Navajo in their blankets. He has returned to the technique many times, and this work is a prime example. Wedge weaving is a variant of slit tapestry in which wefts are run on the diagonal instead of horizontally.</p>\n",
