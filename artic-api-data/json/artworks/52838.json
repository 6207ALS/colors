    "description": "<p>As the court artist of Elector Frederick of Saxony, Lucas Cranach the Elder had the privilege of depicting the courtly entertainment of the stag hunt. Cranach was renowned for his depictions of hunting trophies in illusionistic trompe l\u2019oeil murals; his contemporaries even claimed that his animal imagery was so lifelike that birds tried to land on the painted stags\u2019 antlers. The grand scale of this two-part woodcut allowed Cranach to include copious details of the deer and dogs; the visible seam in the center demonstrates that the printing shop was not necessarily interested in matching the sides perfectly.</p>\n",
