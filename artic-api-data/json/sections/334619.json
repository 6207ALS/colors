It is an elaborate reprise of the rather rough, experimental drawing (cat. 96) made a few weeks earlier and transferred and printed by the Parisian printer Lemercier. The compositional elements of the two duet lithographs are almost identical, although the scale of the figures in relation to the setting has been altered, and the format of this image is taller and narrower than the first version. Mood and atmosphere are also different; whereas the earlier lithograph with its diffused light and long shadows may be read as a late-afternoon scene, this image is unmistakably nocturnal. The shadows have been deepened, and the sisters\u2019 faces, as well as Beatrix\u2019s forearms, are brilliantly illuminated by the light of a small lamp. The tonal richness of The Duet offers a dramatic contrast to the pale, tenuous character of Whistler\u2019s earlier attempt, which was one of his first experiments on the new papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. In this second version, the artist made an initial tonal underdrawing of the two women by rubbing the crayon marks with a stump to create an even undertone in their gowns. He then worked over this layer, densely hatching with a pointed crayon, and using the stump again to draw the soft masses of the womens\u2019 hair and to indicate their facial features.\n\nThe Ways received Whistler\u2019s transfer drawing for The Duet on August 27, probably together with the drawing for La Belle Jardini\u00e8re (cat. 101). The printers worked quickly, and their initial proofs of both lithographs on \u201cDutch\u201d paper were mailed to the artist in Paris on the following day (letter 113). Whistler took an immediate dislike to The Duet and had his wife write to the Ways instructing them not to print the usual order of twenty-five impressions (letter 115). A short time later, he wrote for \u201ctwo proofs only\u2014on the Japanese paper\u2014to show what you consider the best condition\u201d (letter 117). His printers must have expressed their admiration of the image in a now-lost letter, and may have compared The Duet to Rembrandt\u2019s nocturnal etchings. On September 18, when Whistler reiterated his dissatisfaction with the lithograph, he wrote: \u201cBut the \u2018Duet\u2019 won\u2019t do\u2014I know all about the Rembrandt effect\u2014but the heads are unworthy. I did not then know my material, and couldn\u2019t see what I was doing, I shall do another of the same subject\u2014meanwhile don\u2019t show it\u201d (letter 120).\n\nEventually time, or perhaps the Ways, convinced Whistler of the merit of The Duet. He was willing to sign many impressions of the lithograph, and the number of impressions listed by T. R. Way in his 1905 catalogue is unusually large. The artist also agreed to include this version of The Duet in the exhibition of his lithographs at the Fine Art Society in 1895\u201396; six impressions sold during the course of the exhibition (app. III.4).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (283 \u00d7 227 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (6), ivory laid paper (295 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; cream laid paper (292 \u00d7 199 mm); cream laid Japanese vellum (338 \u00d7 213 mm), signed; cream wove Japanese vellum (311 \u00d7 232 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (286 \u00d7 202 mm), signed; cream laid paper (268 \u00d7 239 mm). London: BM (2), ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 198 mm), signed; grayish white chine (258 \u00d7 176 mm) mounted on white plate paper (334 \u00d7 240 mm).

Therefore, it must be concluded that Whistler simply changed his opinion over time, as he did with a number of other lithographs, and eventually came to share his printers\u2019 high regard for the image.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 104, only state.
