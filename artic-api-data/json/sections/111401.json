Within the arch are tiny soldiers wearing the uniform of the civil guard; they fire rifles equipped with bayonets. Atop the buttress that supports the arch, several tiny, naked human-animal figures appear to be shooting cannons but are in fact operating theatrical spotlights (see fig. 1 and fig. 2). Electric spotlights began to be used in the 1880s, but the stands and the smoke emanating from these suggest they could also be carbon arc lamps. Their light illuminates several chamber pots falling from the sky in sheet 3G as well as the figure of Neptune (Poseidon in Greek mythology) rising up from the swirling sea (see sheet 3G and folio 3H/I). A grotesque figure also fires a large cannon or spotlight in sheets 4A and 5A (fig. 3).\n\nHere, as in sheet 3D, the outer arcs that once flanked Christ\u2019s head were removed early in the drawing\u2019s history. The paper appears lighter in the areas where the medium was scratched away. In both sheets, Ensor used green colored pencil to enhance the clouds, smoke, and rays of light. SMC/KJN\n\nEnsor\u2019s fascination with the visual energy produced by the contrasts of light and dark and the interaction of his figures within pictorial space is reflected in both this sheet and the print Capture of a Strange Town (fig. 4; see also sheets 3G, 3H/I, 4F, 4G, 4H, and 4I). Indeed, the artist was constantly preoccupied by light and space. Ensor had a strong memory for composition and design; the work of other artists seems to have frequently stuck with him and been integrated into his own oeuvre. Closer consideration of Capture of a Strange Town reveals a probable source for its composition: the mezzotint Belshazzar\u2019s Feast by John Martin, an English Romantic artist and favorite of King Leopold I of Belgium (fig. 5). The explosion of the elements and fantastical landscapes lie at the heart of Martin\u2019s biblical scenes, which exhibit an energy that clearly left its mark on Ensor. The Belgian artist likely saw Martin\u2019s work in Ernest Chesneau\u2019s La peinture anglaise (English Painting; A. Quantin, 1882), as he copied several works from this book.
