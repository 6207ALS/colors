    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this painting, the great 17th century English poet Milton composes his famous epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost.&quot; The poem tells of the rebel angels led by Satan, who rise up against God and are cast out of heaven. At this point in his life, Milton had gone blind, but he continued to create poetry by dictating lines as he created them to his daughter. The painting, made in 1794, is by the Swiss born artist Henry Fuseli, who spent most of his working life in England. Fuseli is known for his interest in the power of dreams and of the imagination. Former Director and President of the Museum,  Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: Here you see the poet and his sightless eyes are turned upwards as if he's anticipating or drawing on the inspiration for his poem, and he is dictating it to his middle daughter. There's a shaft of light that falls on her that illuminates the paper on which she's writing. It's a glimmer of light in the darkness of Milton's life, but it's so to suggest an inspiration, perhaps divine.</p>\n",
