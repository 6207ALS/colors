    "description": "<p>Architect Edgar Melchior Newman was born in 1863 in Indiana, where his father owned a furniture factory. In his 20s he began his architectural profession in Chicago with the Firm of Adler and Sullivan, where he worked on the Auditorium Theater and worked alongside Frank Lloyd Wright. Newman is often associated with the Prairie School and Arts and Crafts schools of architecture and, accordingly, a substantial amount of his work were residential projects in the Craftsman bungalow style. In 1892 he established his own architecture firm in Chicago. One of his first projects was the Kranz Candy Store on State Street. While he was most known for his residential work in the northern suburbs of Chicago, he also worked on non-residential projects such as the Auditorium Building and Theater, Immaculate Conception School, and the Chinese Government buildings at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition. This collection includes drawings, photographs, correspondence, genealogical information, and printed materials documenting Newman\u2019s personal life and architectural career.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Newman,%20Edgar,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
