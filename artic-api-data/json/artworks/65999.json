This large sheet, much admired and exhibited during the artist\u2019s lifetime, captures the waterfront through a window on the Weehawken Ferry. Marin painted the upper edge to resemble a rolled canvas window covering, employing a playful trompe l\u2019oeil manner. Equally improvisational is the artist\u2019s inclusion of a pink mountain range beyond the New York skyline, which equates nature\u2019s grand peaks and valleys with the soaring towers and narrow canyons of the urban landscape.</p>\n",
