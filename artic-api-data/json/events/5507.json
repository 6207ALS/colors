    "description": "<p>Join Kelly Church, Ottawa/Pottawatomi/Ojibwe artist, educator, and culture keeper, as she shares how tradition grounds her fifth-generation basket-weaving practice.</p><p>Like many Native artists before her, Church relies on black ash trees to provide the raw materials for her basket weaving. However over the past several decades, an invasive insect called the emerald ash borer has substantially reduced its availability. Church will discuss the implications of the ash borer for future generations of basket makers, and share what it means to incorporate new materials into her work.</p><p><em>Generously supported by the Bernice and Seymour Nordenberg Fund. </em></p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p>Kelly Church is an Ottawa/Pottawatomi/Ojibwe black ash basket maker, fiber artist, educator, activist and culture keeper. A member of the Gun Lake Band in Michigan and a Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Ojibwe descendent, she comes from an unbroken line of black ash basket makers and from the largest black ash weaving family in the Great Lakes region.
