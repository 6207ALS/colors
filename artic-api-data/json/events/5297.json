    "description": "<p>Conflict is as central to human experience as love. In this virtual and participatory gallery conversation, led by Austen Walker and Jes\u00fas M. Maldonado Trevi\u00f1o, reflect on artworks that explore the nature of strife.</p><p><strong>Austen Walker</strong> (they/them) is a summer intern in the Art Institute's Department of Learning and Public Engagement. They are a senior at the University of Rochester, where they study anthropology, particularly queer anthropology, and research the construction of (trans)gender in virtual performance spaces. They have taught children and teens on many topics, from feminist theory and poetry to calculus and chemistry. They also write short fiction; their work spans many genres, but always falls into the realm of queer identity and family.</p><p><strong>Jes\u00fas M. Maldonado Trevi\u00f1o</strong> is a summer intern in the Department of Learning and Public Engagement. Jes\u00fas holds a BA in English and global studies from Lawrence University.
