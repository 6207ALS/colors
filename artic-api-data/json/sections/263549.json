Here, the artist did not use the brush-and-wash technique of those earlier efforts, but instead employed only crayon and scraper to render the figure. He indicated the outlines of the body beneath the transparent draperies with a series of long, light strokes in crayon. The contours of the head and shoulders were more heavily worked, providing a contrast to the soft, floating effect of the garment. Whistler then scraped highlights into the toned ground in the areas of the hairband, the strips of fabric crossing the torso, and at both wrists. These are so fine that they are barely visible in lightly inked impressions.\n\nThe subject of a model in neo-Grecian dress leaning against a rail is related to numerous works in Whistler\u2019s oeuvre. His first studies of lightly draped young models were executed in the mid-1860s, and he returned to the theme in his work in every medium throughout his career. The pose of Study is duplicated in reverse in a pastel drawing of 1885/86, Variations in Violet and Rose (fig. 19a [M 1079]). Whistler\u2019s choice of colored inks for some impressions of this print and his use of a half-tint ground suggest a comparison to his pastel and chalk drawings of similar subjects, many of which were drawn on brown papers.\n\nChicago: AIC, black ink on ivory plate paper (322 \u00d7 210 mm); MWC, black ink on cream laid paper (310 \u00d7 234 mm); Palmer, black ink on grayish ivory wove proofing paper (382 \u00d7 281 mm).
