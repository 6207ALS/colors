StrotherGirl Reading in Bed, c. 1882  \nPen and brown ink, on pink wove paper; 11.3 \u00d7 18 cm (4 7/16 \u00d7 7 1/16 in.)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, the Charles Deering Collection, 1927.5877\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">James McNeill Whistler\u2019s friends and biographers, Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell, wrote that female companionship was essential for the artist and that most of his friends were women. Partly as a result of these relationships, his oeuvre includes numerous images of bourgeois ladies engaged in such leisure activities as reading, sewing, making music, and simply resting. In this drawing, the subject is probably his companion and frequent model, Maud Franklin, whom he depicts reading within the confines of her bedroom. The fine lines of the pen and the small scale of the work accord with the intimacy of the private domestic setting. Whistler\u2019s pen strokes are at their most delicate where they describe the figure, the pillows, and the headboard against which she rests. The brown ink in these areas is very lightly applied, in contrast to other sections like the foot of the bed, where the lines are darker and more vigorous. The foreground is left blank, creating the impression that the blanket covering the woman extends outward, as if to envelop the viewer. This effect, combined with the pink tone of the paper, contributes to the warmth and intimacy of the scene. The restrained handling and charged blank spaces of the drawing parallel Whistler\u2019s work in other media during this period, indicating how even a highly personal sketch could be harnessed to extend his artistic explorations.\n\nWhistler\u2019s drawing of Franklin recalls a much earlier etching he made while staying with his half sister, Deborah Haden, which shows \u201cDebo\u201d engaged in the same activity (fig. 25.1; [K 28]). Given the intimate setting, his models for such bedroom scenes tended, not surprisingly, to be limited to family members, close friends, and romantic partners. Whistler produced a number of related images of Franklin around the time of the Art Institute drawing, during a long period of sporadic convalescence, the result of illness or possibly pregnancy. A watercolor painted in 1883/84, Resting in Bed (fig. 25.2; [M 901]), shows a similar scene from the other end of the bed. Years later, when his wife Beatrice fell mortally ill with cancer, Whistler returned to this practice of convalescent art making, creating lithographs of her as she lay on a chaise longue in their room at the Savoy Hotel in London. In The Siesta (fig. 25.3; [Way 122]), as in the images of Franklin and Haden, she is shown lying under a blanket and appears to have a book or newspaper perched on her lap. She is not reading, however, but rather looking toward him, with her arm hanging limply at her side. These affectionate images of the women closest to him punctuate his life, artistic testaments to quiet moments of leisure, sickness, or both.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Girl Reading in Bed corresponds to Margaret F.
