    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the center of this turbulent scene, the Old Testament hero Samson struggles against his captors, who are Philistines.  Samson's lover, Delilah, who betrayed him to the Philistines, reclines to the left.  She had discovered that Samson's strength lay in his hair, left long to symbolize an oath to God.  She ordered it to be cut as he slept.  His strength gone, Samson was then captured.  Rubens, the foremost Flemish Baroque artist painted this scene around 1610.  He had spent several years working and studying in Italy.  Here Samson's muscular body and dynamic struggling pose recall a celebrated antique sculpture in the Vatican collection in Rome.  Rubens made this small, loosely brushed painting as an oil study for a much larger work.  It is painted over an earlier sketch.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: If you look at the upper right you'll see some drapery in blue and red that doesn't seem to make much sense in relation to the composition.  That's because he's taken an earlier sketch for the Adoration of the Magi and he's turned it around, upside-down, and he's just simply reused it to fill it with the story of Samson.</p>\n",
