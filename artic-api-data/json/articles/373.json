    "copy": " Quiz of the week: what\u2019s a seven-letter word starting with \u201cP\u201d that identifies the last name of an artist who used paint from cans to make his pictures?   If you guessed Pollock, it\u2019s a good guess.   But did you know that Pablo Picasso started using ready-mix paints from cans (we call it enamel) well before the dawn of action painting, as early as 1912? Picasso was by far the most influential of the early adopters of this brand new and unconventional medium. If standing in front of rows of paint cans at the hardware store doesn\u2019t seem so revolutionary today, one has to realize that a hundred years ago the fact that you could paint your house or your furniture yourself without having to hire a professional painter who would mix the colors in the base paint was quite extraordinary. After all, the invention of the collapsible metal paint tube as we know it today dated only to a little over a half century prior (around 1840).   In the early 1900s in France the brand Ripolin was all the rage. The name originated from Riep, its inventor, and lin , which is shorthand in French for linseed oil, the binder of the paint, or, in other words, the stuff that makes it stick to the wall. The brand boasted superior quality and attractive advertising, vestiges of which are still seen all around France today (above is a picture I took one summer in Marseille, in the south of France, with a vintage one immediately below).   Ripolin was so famous that, much like \u201cto google\u201d today, very soon the verb \u201cto ripolin\u201d (or ripoliner in French) was coined. The famed architect Le Corbusier went as far as to say that it was a moral imperative to cover all surfaces with a coat of white Ripolin, for love of purity, and he called this \u201cthe law of Ripolin.\u201d   We still don\u2019t know exactly why Picasso picked up the stuff in the first place. Certainly an avant-garde interest in unconventional materials played a role, as well as the possibilities opened by a new kind of paint that dried into a hard, glossy enamel in hours, unmarred by the marks of the brush, but prone to creative \u201caccidents\u201d such as dramatic wrinkling and dripping.   \u201cYou don\u2019t tell someone miserable to wipe his tears,\u201d he said to his friend and poet Jean Cocteau in 1953 when Cocteau commented on the numerous drips in the murals for the Chapel of War and Peace in Vallauris.   Ripolin paint also came in a range of very bright colors and dried fast, allowing free range to Picasso\u2019s insatiable creativity without fear of smudging what was already on the canvas.   I cannot help but think that at the beginning the material also responded to an anti-establishment \u201cangst,\u201d or at least that\u2019s how I read his letter of 1912 (Picasso was in his early 30s then) to his dealer Kahnweiler referring to his Ripolin paintings: \u201cPerhaps we will manage to shock and disgust the whole world and we will not have said it all.\u201d   Identifying exactly in which pictures Picasso used Ripolin (he continued to use it until the end of his life together with artist\u2019s tube paints and many other painting materials) is a big deal. So much of a big deal that we, at the Art Institute, have made it a research priority for our team of art detectives (aka museum scientists) to figure out what\u2019s in the paint. We even went on eBay to buy 100-year-old cans of paint for reference (yes, you can find those too, and they're for sale!).   After all Ripolin, together with Magna (used by Roy Lichtenstein among others) and Duco (used by David Alfaro Siqueiros), is one of the very few brand names of paint that is actually noted on labels and exhibition catalogues, as opposed to a generic identification of media.   If you are curious, go see The Red Armchair in the exhibition Picasso and Chicago at the Art Institute until May 12 (tip: it\u2019s painted with Ripolin and oil). Or, to close with another challenge, go find a lid of a Ripolin can stuck to one of the Picasso sculptures in the exhibition.   If you need more visual clues of what to look for, watch the videos and look at the display cases that hold some of those eBay finds. Hopefully you won\u2019t be shocked and disgusted, but perhaps a bit entertained. \u2014Francesca Casadio, Andrew W. Mellon Senior Conservation Scientist ",
