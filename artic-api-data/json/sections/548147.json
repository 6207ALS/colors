Susan Auth has studied this material for years and has suggested that these belong to a series of female characters that would have been recognized from New Comedy. These plaques seems related to the red-haired courtesan or the more generic Maenad that often accompanied Dionysos. Charis Mahnke, who has studied these plaques more recently, considers them more generically, as female masks with red hair.\n\nThe complete image would have been formed by placing two slices, cut from a long bar, one reversed from the same cane, next to each other to form a complete face. While it was common for dealers and collectors to create complete faces in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there are a few examples of plaques preserved from the period where the two-part face was still attached to the wooden backing and retained additional decorative elements.\n\nInlays like these would have appealed to the Roman elite, who had a tradition of attending theatrical performances. Cat. 78 is a variation of a well-known type; examples of it exist in many American and European collections. Cat. 79, which seems to be a woman, appears to be unique; the three preserved hair elements are extraordinary.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Auth, \u201cMosaic Glass Mask Plaques and the Ancient Theater,\u201d pp. 63\u201368, for a description of female plaques.\n\nAuth, \u201cMosaic Glass Mask Plaques and the Ancient Theater,\u201d pp. 64\u201367, figs. 15\u201316.\n\nMahnke, Alexandrinische Mosaikglaseinlagen, pp. 48\u201349.\n\nSee Grose, Early Ancient Glass, pp. 352\u201354, fig. 163, for an illustration of a satyr mask bar in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and a short history of Ptolemaic and Romano-Egyptian cast monochrome and mosaic glass inlays; Freer Gallery of Art, Ancient Glass in the Freer Gallery of Art, p. 20, fig. 58, acc. no. 90.529.\n\nSee Goldstein, Pre-Roman and Early Roman Glass, p. 237, pl. 32, no. 688, for the complete grotesque head formerly in the Sangiorgi collection, acc. no. 66.1.78; Christie\u2019s, Ancient Glass, lots 49\u201353, for mask plaques that were cut and joined to create a full face and then surrounded with gold-edged paper typical of European dealers at the time.\n\nSee Tait, Five Thousand Years of Glass, p. 52, fig. 59, for a grotesque mask with a decorative strip above and mounted on a wood backing; Cooney, Catalogue of Egyptian Antiquities, p. 136, no. 1682; Mahnke, Alexandrinische Mosaikglaseinlagen, pp. 86\u201387, no. 11, for the face of a servant surrounded by mosaic strips of rosettes and backed by wood in the Greco-Roman Museum, Alexandria.\n\nThis fragment was published in Allen, Handbook of the Egyptian Collection, p. 120 (illus.); Casagrande-Kim, When the Greeks Ruled, pp. 24\u201325, nos. 1\u201311; Luckner, \u201cAncient Glass,\u201d p. 78 (includes a backlit image of the fragment showing the distinct clusters of canes employed to create the design); Mahnke, Alexandrinische Mosaikglaseinlagen, pp. 123\u201324, no. 72.\n\nThis fragment was published in Casagrande-Kim, When the Greeks Ruled, p. 106, no. 140.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Two fragments of inlays depicting theater masks, both late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D., from left: cat. 78, cat. 79.\n\n</section>",
