He rarely painted single beauties like this example, but his depictions of Tokyo\u2019s inhabitants enjoying arts, beauty, and fashion\u2014including their visits to the Yoshiwara pleasure quarters\u2014were renowned for capturing the spirit of the age. Moronobu was originally from Awa province (now Chiba prefecture) and by the 1670s had moved into the city, where he worked as a book illustrator and print designer before focusing on scroll paintings towards the end of his career.</p>\n",
