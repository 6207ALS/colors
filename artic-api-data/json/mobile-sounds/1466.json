    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This intricate bronze statue inlaid with silver shows the lion-headed incarnation of Vishnu. It was made in Orissa on the coast of Eastern Indian in the fifteenth century.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Vishnu in Hinduism is regarded as the preserver of the universe and he takes many different incarnations or avatars and his man-lion form is one of the most famous and renowned. In this form, he is trying to destroy a demon who had a boon from the gods that he could not be destroyed by a man or a beast. So Vishnu takes the form that is half man, half beast, that of the man-lion. And this form is called Narasimha.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Narasimha\u2019s flaring headdress resembles the mane of a lion. His bulging eyes and his toothy grin marked with traces of blood red pigment add to his ferocious terrifying appearance. The pigment would have been applied in the temple as the deity was venerated.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Narasimha is seated with this knees bound almost ascetic-like holding on to his Shakti or his female energy, the goddess of the earth and of fertility who is seen holding a lotus flower in her hand. While Narasimha himself is holding the emblems of Vishnu which include the discus and the conch shell.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: It\u2019s hard to say exactly how this sculpture might have been used. While ritual bronzes were displayed in sacred temples, they were sometimes paraded through the streets on festival days as part of great celebratory processions.</p>\n",
