    "description": "<p>Melinda Watt, chair and Christa C. Mayer Thurman Curator of Textiles, discusses the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/9325/morris-and-company-the-business-of-beauty\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Morris and Company: The Business of Beauty</em></a>, highlighting William Morris's unique aesthetic vision and philosophy for home furnishings\u2014and his enduring influence.</p><p>Artist, designer, and writer William Morris (1838\u20131896) founded Morris &amp; Co. 160 years ago, in 1861. The company quickly became regarded for the objects it designed and made for home interiors, and its style became synonymous with the British Arts and Crafts movement of the late 19th century. This exhibition explores the continued relevance and potency of the company's aesthetic vision, drawing on the Art Institute's significant holdings of textiles and wallpaper designed by William Morris, his daughter and colleague May Morris, and longtime collaborator John Henry Dearle. <br></p><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong><br></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.</p><p>If you have any questions about virtual programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.</p><p>Closed captioning will be available for this program.
