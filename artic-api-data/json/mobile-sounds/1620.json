    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Maurice Denis belonged to a group of young French artists who called themselves the Nabis after the Hebrew word for profits. The Nabis were interested in imbuing their subject matter with a sense of mystery and otherness. For Denis, a devout catholic, an ordinary landscape could be loaded with manifestations of the divine. Denis sets this scene, which he titled \u201cEaster Mystery\u201d in the village of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, west of Paris, where he lived. The large house in the background would later become his home. In the foreground, an angel emerges from a cave, as if to announce Christ rising, to the mourning Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene. Behind them are white clad figures who hasten toward an astonishing sight, the hand of God himself, appearing miraculously from the trees to offer the Eucharist. Denis strived for simple, flattened forms that sometimes verge on abstraction. He believed this process reflected spiritual purification, and he looked to the work of early Italian renaissance art, and especially to the work of the painter monk, Fra Angelico for inspiration. But he and the other Nabis were also deeply influenced by avant-garde French art. Here, Denis explores the effects of the pointillist technique of building up the picture surface with tiny dots of paint.</p>\n",
