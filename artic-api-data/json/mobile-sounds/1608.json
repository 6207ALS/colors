    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This lyrical portrayal of two girls by Auguste Renoir is one of the most popular works in the Art Institute. Renoir painted it in 1881, setting it on the terrace of the restaurant Fournaise, which overlooked a modest stretch of the river Seine just outside Paris. By 1881 he had been visiting the restaurant and painting its fashionable Parisian visitors and beautiful surroundings for more than ten years. Here, Renoir depicts an elegant young woman sitting in the warm sunshine accompanied by a little girl. They are not, in fact, sisters, but unrelated models despite the painting\u2019s title. The young woman wears a female boater\u2019s blue flannel costume, which she has enlivened with a cherry red hat and a cluster of bright spring flowers on the bodice. These elements with the little girl\u2019s flower laden hat and their basket of wool lend the image an intense vibrant quality. The hats and wool basket are built up with thick swaths of paint. They contrast strikingly with the girls\u2019 porcelain-like faces, whose rosy coloring is painted with tiny brush strokes, giving their skin a smooth delicate effect.</p>\n",
