    "description": "<p>Goldberg\u2019s research on hospital design allowed him to refine his ideal of \u201cgeo-centric\u201d or \u201cnuclear\u201d plans for spaces where patients would receive direct care, including nursing wards, surgery suites, and intensivecare units. At the most basic level, geocentric spaces were planned with a focal point or epicenter that corresponded to a central activity or purpose. In a hospital setting, these designs describe the optimal location of the individual patient\u2019s body within an area of specialized care. For a surgical suite, for example, Goldberg proposed a ring of six egg-shaped operating rooms, ensuring that all movements in the space remained equidistant from the patient (and surgeon), with the residual pie-shaped spaces reserved for scrub stations, supply closets, and observation rooms. Similarly, Goldberg\u2019s radial design for surgical recovery rooms and intensive-care wards ensured uninterrupted lines of sight to the central nursing stations and privacy for patients, a model that provided the basic spatial and functional principles for all of his future hospitals.</p>\n",
