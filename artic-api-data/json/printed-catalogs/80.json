    "copy": " Maintaining the central truth that exciting works of art are rich in great stories, this book draws inspiration from an exhibit that focused on six diverse objects from the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection. The book features the stories of these artworks, as well as an engaging account of how a museum staff, an architect, and a children\u2019s art team worked together to create the exhibition. The full-color plates and lively text will delight children and parents planning their visits to the museum.   Jean Sousa   96 pages, 9 x 9 in. 176 ills.
