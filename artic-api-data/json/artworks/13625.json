    "description": "<p>Joseph Sterling began photographing at age 11 and went on to study at Chicago\u2019s famed Institute of Design (ID) under the tutelage of Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind, and Frederick Sommer. Sterling spent five years in the later 1950s photographing disaffected youth; he interacted openly and directly with the teenagers, a choice that resulted, he said, in \u201ceither near-total failure or great success.\u201d In 1961 work from his master\u2019s thesis, \u201cThe Age of Adolescence,\u201d was featured in a special ID-themed issue of <em>Aperture</em> and exhibited at the Art Institute; this print was purchased by the museum the same year. Rather than a sociological study, Sterling focused on gesture and pose in his photographs, hinting at the generational tensions that would explode later in the 1960s.</p>\n",
