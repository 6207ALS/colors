    "provenance_text": "M. A. Bellino; sold Galerie George Petit, Paris, May 20, 1892, lot 2, as La M\u00e9nag\u00e8re, for 2,700 francs [price according to an annotated copy of the sale catalogue in the Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie, The Hague]. Durand-Ruel, New York, no. 2257, 1894 [New York gallery and number according to a label on the back of the frame; year according to a notation in the Registrar\u2019s records] [1]. Martin A. Ryerson, by 1916 [according to a list dated February 27, 1922 in the Archives, Art Institute] [2]; intermittently on loan to the Art Institute from 1925 [see Art Institute of Chicago 1925]; bequeathed to the Art Institute, 1933.\n\n\n[1] According to Gabriel P. Weisberg, Bonvin (Paris: Geoffrey-Dechaume, 1979), p. 206, no. 98, the painting was owned by an A. Gautier and was sold in his sale at H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, on May 26, 1894. However, only one painting by Bonvin appears in the sale catalogue, and it is titled \u201cLa rue des Cochers \u00e0 Saint-German.\u201d\n\nWeisberg also states that the painting was owned by an A. Robaut and was included in his sale at H\u00f4tel Drouot in Paris on December 18, 1907. However, the catalogue contains only one painting by Bonvin, titled \u201cLa M\u00e9nag\u00e8re\u201d, and states that it is \u201csign\u00e9 \u00e0 gauche et dat\u00e9: 1851\u201d. The Art Institute of Chicago painting, however, is signed \u201cF. Bonvin\u201d in the upper right corner and is not dated. \n\n[2] According Gabriel P. Weisberg, Bonvin (Paris: Geoffrey-Dechaume, 1979), p. 206, no. 98, the painting was sold from Tempelaere on October 11, 1923 to Brame, and then sold again by Tempelaere on April 18 1924. This is based on the Galerie Brame et Lorenceau entrybook and stockbooks, 1887\u20131935, no. 3419, held at the Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles. However, according to a document dated February 17, 1922 in the Ryerson Papers, Art Institute Archives, Martin A. Ryerson acquired the painting by 1916, contradicting Weisberg\u2019s statement that the painting in the Galerie Brame et Lorenceau entry book and stockbooks is the same as the present painting.",
