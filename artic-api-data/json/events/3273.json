Are there essential readings, documents, films, or other forms of cultural literacy that promote human consciousness and engagement, and how to we learn about them? Join a facilitated conversation about the ways that cultural consciousness is transmitted and circulated through texts. What is on your essential reading list?</p><p>In this new interactive lecture series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Educators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p>",
