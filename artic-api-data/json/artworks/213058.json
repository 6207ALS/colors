    "description": "<p>In 2011 Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin of Studio Formafantasma were commissioned by the Italian Plart Foundation to undertake a retrospective study of the centuries-old technology of making plastics from natural polymers extracted from plant or animal sources, rather than from petroleum. The results of this study, entitled Botanica, include a collection of tableware that combines organic plastics derived from historical techniques with traditional materials like wood, ceramic, and metal. The Botanica Plastic Eco-Vase, for example, is made of beeswax, wood, and shellac\u2014a natural polymer extracted from insect excrement that was popular up to the 1930s. The vase\u2019s textured finishes and details evoke tradition and the handcrafted, yet display desirable qualities of contemporary design.</p>\n",
