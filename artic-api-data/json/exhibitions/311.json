    "short_description": "The Great Wave under a pink sky: Works by Hokusai, Utamaro, Sharaku, and others drawn from the world-renowned Clarence Buckingham Collection of Japanese Prints shed light on varied issues of connoisseurship. On display are several examples of alternate versions of the same print that differ in terms of color or other details. Through this exhibition, we examine what these differences can tell us about the intricacies of the dating, authentication, repair, commercial purposes, and production of Japanese woodblock prints.",
