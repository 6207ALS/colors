    "copy": " We might have missed April Fools\u2019 Day, but the beauty of trompe l\u2019oeil painting is that it can fool you any day of the year. French for \u201cdeceives the eye,\u201d trompe l\u2019oeil is so meticulously detailed that it literally tricks us into believing we are seeing, not a two-dimensional painting of something, but the actual three-dimensional thing. Here are a few of our favorites from the collection.   Otis Kaye\u2019s Heart of the Matter (1963) : This truly remarkable painting by the 20th-century trompe l\u2019oeil master Otis Kaye is a commentary on the intimate connection between art and commerce. Kaye surrounded fragments of Rembrandt\u2019s Aristotle with a Bust of Homer \u2014which had just sold for a record-breaking amount\u2014with various currency and placed a stack of bills right at the center of the composition: the true heart of the matter. (The illusion of this work is so effective we have often overheard visitors incredulous that there are not items affixed to the canvas.)   William Michael Harnett\u2019s For Sunday\u2019s Dinner (1888) : In this painting by 19th-century trompe l\u2019oeil painter William Michael Harnett, a rooster hangs illusionistically in front of a painted door with its throat cut and most of its feathers plucked, emphasizing the gruesome beginning of a delicious Sabbath meal. The painting\u2019s title and the rough, blemished surface of the door suggest a country dinner rather than sophisticated urban fare; the unpolished, homey meal nostalgically hints at a simpler past.     Rack Picture for Dr. Nones attributed to William A. Mitchell (1879) : A variation of trompe l\u2019oeil is the rack picture, which simulates an old-fashioned bulletin board that held important, yet ephemeral documents like letters and newspaper clippings under strips of ribbon. Such \u201crack picture\u201d still lifes functioned as biographical portraits, in this case for Dr. Samuel Smith Nones, the prominent Philadelphia dentist who commissioned this work.   Gaming Set by the Du Paquier Porcelain Company (about 1735) : This gaming set ups the ante by adding a few cards to the deck\u2014or at least what appear to be cards. Painted on the top and interior of the porcelain gaming box\u2019s lid are a few coveted cards. Hopefully the trick never cost anyone a game.   Charles-Antoine Coypel\u2019s Portrait of Philippe Coypel and His Wife (1742) : Coypel\u2019s double portrait of his brother and his wife (possibly a gift for the couple\u2019s 10th wedding anniversary) almost has us believing the pair are leaning out of the picture frame and into the gallery. When it was shown at the 1742 Salon, one critic noted, \u201cOne sees here a finesse of the crayon whose effect is to seize all the spectators and is on the point of fooling them.\u201d   Sylvia Plimack Mangold\u2019s In Memory of My Father (1976) : While this isn\u2019t a trompe l\u2019oeil per se, it presents a mundane reality so fully real that it not only tricks the eye, it tricks the mind into envisioning the artist\u2019s father laying this floor, measuring stick in hand, as he creates a floor perfect enough for his daughter to walk upon\u2014and to remember him by. Within the painting, the measuring stick anchors the viewer\u2019s perception of the tile floor, while also acting as a poignant marker of time, stopping on the right edge of the canvas at 66 3/4 inches, which corresponds to the age of the artist\u2019s father upon his death.
