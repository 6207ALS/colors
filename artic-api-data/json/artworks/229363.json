    "description": "<p>By the 1970s, Roy Lichtenstein\u2019s comic-book style of painting had become his trademark. While he had adapted his early compositions from actual comic books, here Lichtenstein rather referred to an art historical rather than a pop culture source: <em>Henri Matisse\u2019s Red Studio</em> (1911; Museum of Modern Art, New York), which features Matisse\u2019s canvases casually set around a room. Into this flattened studio space Lichtenstein similarly inserted whole or partial versions of his own real and imagined artworks across a range of subject matter, including geometric abstraction. This painting\u2019s title calls out the 1962 print Foot Medication, reimagined as a monumental painting at upper left. This kind of self-quotation, at once playful and thoughtful, would become another feature of Lichtenstein\u2019s production.<p>\n",
