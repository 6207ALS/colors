StrotherStudy for \u201cThe Blue Girl: Portrait of Miss Elinor Leyland,\u201d c. 1879  \nPen and brown ink and brown wash on cream pseudo-laid paper, tipped onto cream wove paper; 17.9 \u00d7 11.2 cm (7 1/6 \u00d7 4 7/16 in.)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, Bryan Lathrop Collection, 1921.124\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">James McNeill Whistler attempted several \u201cBlue Girl\u201d oil portraits throughout the 1870s and 1880s. This study emerged from his work on the first, which he intended as a portrait of Elinor Leyland, the youngest daughter of Frederick Leyland, Whistler\u2019s most important patron of the 1870s. \u201cBaby\u201d or \u201cBabs\u201d Leyland, as she was affectionately known, began sitting for the painting in the early 1870s. Several other pictures also relate to Whistler\u2019s work on the portrait, and both a pastel study for the painting (fig. 21.1; [M 521]) and a drypoint from this period (fig. 21.2; [K 109]) show Elinor in the same distinctive, almost defiant, pose she strikes here. The energetic scribbles of the pen-and-ink sketch are well suited to capturing the youthful vitality of the subject. The quick pen strokes used to outline the figure render the girl\u2019s bold stance dynamically, while the ink wash lends a softened appearance to her garments, a subtle indication of their cashmere and velvet materials. Though the drawing is not especially detailed, it conveys much about the model\u2019s posture and attire. The model\u2019s facial features and the background, by contrast, are only summarily indicated.\n\nDue in part to the deterioration of his relationship with Frederick Leyland, Whistler never completed the oil portrait of Elinor. The unfinished canvas was almost entirely destroyed in 1879, and only two small fragments now at the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, remain. In the late 1870s Whistler again took up a \u201cscheme of blue upon blue,\u201d this time using the performer Connie Gilchrist as the model. The dress worn by Gilchrist in the unfinished oil painting, now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow (fig. 21.3; [YMSM 207]), is similar in design to the one worn by Leyland in the Art Institute drawing, although the model\u2019s pose and other elements of the composition are quite different. It is not clear to what extent Whistler considered this project as having arisen out of his earlier work with Leyland, although several contemporaries linked the two paintings.\n\nIn the early 1880s, the artist began work on a different painting with a new sitter, Maud Waller, which also bears connection to the \u201cBlue Girl\u201d works. According to one source, Whistler designed Waller\u2019s dress and commissioned a theatrical costumier to make it. The painting, which was never completed and is now lost, is known through a photograph and a pen-and-ink study (fig. 21.4, [YMSM 226]; and fig. 21.5; [M 846]). As these surviving images reveal, both the costume and the composition closely reiterate the earlier Leyland portrait. Whistler\u2019s effort to remake his previous work with a new model underscores the fact that his \u201cBlue Girl,\u201d as with many of his other portraits, was ultimately important to him principally for its composition and formal relationships, rather than as a meditation on the unique identity of his sitter. Not coincidentally, these same values are reflected in the Art Institute sketch.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Study for \u201cThe Blue Girl: Portrait of Miss Elinor Leyland\u201d corresponds to Margaret F.

See MacDonald (1995), 262 (cat. 717).\n\nAlthough the painting does not survive to provide evidence of the fabrics used for the sitter\u2019s attire, Whistler described these materials in a letter to Walter Greaves, where he referred to \u201cmy picture of little Miss Leyland in blue cashmire [sic] and velvet.\u201d See Whistler to Walter Greaves, 1871/76, in The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed.
