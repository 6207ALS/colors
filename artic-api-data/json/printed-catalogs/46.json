    "copy": " Within any collection of Indian paintings\u2014both illuminated manuscript pages and individual works from royal albums\u2014a great percentage will contain animal imagery, either as a central theme or in a supporting role. This is true whether the painting portrays an Indian deity, illustrates an epic narrative, records the daily life of a prince or a common man, or simply depicts a pet animal. The aim of this book is to provide an account of the fascinating interaction between the realms of the animals and of the mortals and the immortals as represented in paintings created in the Indian subcontinent between about 1400 and 1900. It also provides the reader with glimpses into the dazzling world of form and color that distinguish the traditions of Indian painting.
