    "description": "<p>Though Impressionist artists are perhaps most well known for their depictions of the natural environment, they also painted enduring portraits of people living in a rapidly modernizing world. In this tour, facilitated by educator Nancy Chen, we will examine and discuss portraits by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Gustave Caillebotte, Edgar Degas and others that showcase Impressionism\u2019s aesthetic range and provide a window into life in France at the end of the 19th century.</p><p><strong>Please note: This tour accommodates up to 30 people on a first-come, first-served basis. If the tour reaches capacity, a second tour will be added at 12:45\u20131:30.
