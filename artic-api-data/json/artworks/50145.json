As a photojournalist for Magnum Photos, the agency he founded with his colleagues Robert Capa and David \u201cChim\u201d Seymour, he traveled across the world, photographing some of the most important events of the 20th century. Early in his career, he developed a distinct style of photography and made some of his most famous and enduring images.</p>\n",
