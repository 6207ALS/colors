    "description": "<p>Born and raised in Chicago, Arthur Carrara incorporated both Prairie School and Modernist influences into his education and architectural practice. After graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in architecture, Carrara worked briefly for former Frank Lloyd Wright draftsman John van Bergen before serving in the Army in the South Pacific during World War II. During and after the war, he was commissioned to design buildings in Australia and the Philippines. Carrara returned to Chicago in 1946 and opened his own architectural practice, designing private homes, corporate buildings, exhibition spaces, and industrial products. Carrara opened a second office in Buffalo, New York, in the mid-1960s. Correspondence, magazine articles, exhibition reviews, and other printed materials, project files, and photographs document the varied aspects of Carrara\u2019s career as an architect, designer, author, and lecturer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Carrara,%20Arthur%20A.,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
