    "transcript": "<p>Ann Goldstein:  The &quot;Camouflage Last Supper,&quot; it's a interesting work to consider now as the conclusion of somebody's career who was a Catholic and who was a gay man and who chose to present himself in a way that didn't reveal fully.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n<p>Narrator: Deputy Director and Chair of Modern and Contemporary Art Ann Goldstein.</p>\n<p>Ann Goldstein: We think of Warhol as somebody who produced images of celebrities and commodities and objects, all recognizable. At the end of his career, he was making abstract paintings. Warhol, of course, always said, &quot;Look at the surface of the painting, and you'll see all you need to see about me in it.&quot; The fact that he used camouflage as a device not only for this particular painting but as a device in other paintings at this period, he covered his own self-portrait with camouflage, and he also used it for portraits of others. So he was very interested in maybe using what obscures as a way to also highlight. The choice of Leonardo da Vinci's &quot;Last Supper&quot; is not actually isolated in terms of Warhol's use of an old master painting. For example, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; appears in works going back to the '60s. I think at this point, he was also looking retrospectively both at his own life and at art history. As we look in his work retrospectively, we see a lot more of this mysterious person who tried to deflect readings of his own life in works that actually we see that they were actually much more personal and revealing that we might have actually imagined.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n",
