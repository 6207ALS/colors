    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>An installation completely covers the south wall of the Modern Wing\u2019s Balcony Caf\u00e9, located above Griffin Court on the second floor of the building. In alternating bands of black-and-white text and white-and-black backgrounds, the work reads from top to bottom, \u201cTODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE REST OF YOUR LIFE, TODAY IS THE LAST DAY OF ENDLESS STRIFE, TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF THE LOSS OF LIGHT, TODAY IS THE LAST PLAY OF THE GAME OF LIFE, TODAY IS THE FIRST TIME YOU FIGHT THE FRIGHT,<br>TODAY IS THE FIRST TRY AT EATING RIGHT.\u201d</p>\n<p>The bottom band includes 11 green-and-white smiley faces making various expressions, including devilish, sad, flirty, and bored.</p>\n",
