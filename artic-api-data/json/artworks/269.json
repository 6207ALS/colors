In the field is written ho[pais]kalo[s] (retrograde). On one side of the exterior, Theseus hobbles the Bull of Marathon; there is a tree in the background.  This group is flanked on left and right by duels between naked warriors.  In the field is written h[o]pais.  On the other side of the exterior, there is, on the left, a duel between two naked warriors (shield device of the falling warrior is a snake; there is red blood under his armpit).  In the centre is a naked warrior with a horse to the right.  Beyond this, on the right, is a warrior with shield and spear facing to the right and a warrior (helmet up) to the left, stooping to take his shield out of its covering.  In the field is written h[o]pais [ka]los.</p>\n",
