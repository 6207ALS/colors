Attended by around 1500 adolescent girls from the town of Lunkarasar and surrounding villages, the fair raises awareness of difficulties for women in these communities. In 2003, Gauri Gill set up a photo studio and invited the young women to \u201cportray themselves, as they are, or as they see themselves, or to invent new selves for the camera.\u201d Gill\u2019s portraits convey a hesitant fortitude;  the subjects are unaccustomed to such attention. Gill was subsequently invited to teach the girls photography in workshops held at the fair.</p>\n",
