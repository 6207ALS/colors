Harrison Collection, 1948.418  \nGu\u00e9rin 79, Kornfeld 63 B  \nFor inside and back, see fig. 114.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin produced nine issues of Le sourire (The Smile), his \u201cserious newspaper,\u201d as well as three supplements; this issue is the seventh and did not contain a supplement. This is also the third issue in which Gauguin replaced the word s\u00e9rieux with m\u00e9chant (\u201cwicked\u201d) in the title, a term he adopted to underscore its role as a purely satirical journal. Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897. So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. Gauguin hoped to use the mimeograph machine to print images and text simultaneously. Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text of the August, September, and October 1899 issues were rendered partially illegible due to the broken lines and uneven printing. In this and later issues of the journal, he integrated wood-block prints, such as the headpiece, to improve the clarity of his illustrations. In this issue of the journal, he included both a mimeographed vignette and a wood-block-printed headpiece for his illustrations. In later issues of the journal, he turned exclusively to wood-block printing for his illustrations.\n\nAn impression of Man Carrying Bananas Followed by Two Horses adorns the front page of this issue. This impression is printed in black ink that contained a significant amount of linseed oil. An excess of linseed oil is indicated by the strike-through of oil on the verso of the sheet. The mimeographed image below the headpiece is another representation of Gauguin\u2019s Composition with Caricatures of Gauguin and Governor Gallet (cat. 116).\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n374 \u00d7 509 mm (full sheet); 374 \u00d7 256 mm (folded sheet); 103 \u00d7 149 mm (printed headpiece)\n\nIn 1948, when the issue entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection there was a thick paper guard adhered along the left edge of the pages that mistakenly identified it as the spine edge of the issue. It also made opening the issue impossible. It was removed, and toned Japanese paper was used to properly reattach the pages along the right edge to restore its original format.\n\nThe issue is in sound and stable condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
