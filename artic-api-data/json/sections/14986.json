Beta-radiography Beta Plate [14C Poly(Methyl Methacrylate) Sheet] source, GE Healthcare UK Limited, Amersham, recorded digitally with a Regius FP-1S plate [deposited layer of (BaFBrI:Eu) on polyethylene terephthalate] and a Konica Minolta Regius \u03a3II Scanner utilizing ImagePilot software (Version 1.70R00E).\n\nSinar rePro with 86H back with internal IR filter removed, external Heliopan Infrared RG 830 (87c) filter (1.0\u20131.1 \u00b5m); Goodrich/Sensors Unlimited SU640SDV-1.7RT (0.9\u20131.7 \u00b5m) with H filter (1.1\u20131.4 \u00b5m) and J filter (1.5\u20131.7 \u00b5m).\n\nSinar rePro camera with 86H back (B+W Infrared 093 filter, PECA 918 UV/IR interference cut filter).\n\nSample and cross-sectional analysis were performed using a Zeiss Axioplan2 research microscope equipped with reflected light/UV fluorescence and a Leica DMC 4500 digital camera. Types of illumination used: darkfield, differential interference contrast (DIC), and UV. In situ photomicrographs were taken with Wild Heerbrugg M7A StereoZoom microscope fitted with Olympus DP71 microscope digital camera or a Leica M125 Stereo Zoom microscope fitted with a Leica MC170 HD microscope digital camera.\n\nSeveral spots on the paintings were analyzed in situ with a Bruker TRACeR III-V with rhodium tube.\n\nSamples were mounted on a Specac diamond compression cell for analysis by FTIR. Data were collected in transmission mode between 4000 and 400 cm<sup>-1</sup> at 4 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution and 128 scans per spectrum using a Bruker Hyperion microscope with MCT D315 detector, interfaced to a Tensor 27 spectrometer bench.\n\nCross sections were analyzed with a Hitachi S-3400N-II VPSEM with an Oxford energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and a Hitachi solid-state BSE detector. Analysis was performed at the Atomic and Nanoscale Characterization Experimental (NUANCE) Center, Electron Probe Instrumentation Center (EPIC) facility, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.\n\nAnalysis was performed using an Agilent Thermal Separation Probe (TSP) inserted into the Multimode Inlet of an Agilent 7890B GC, equipped with an Agilent HP-5ms Ultra Inert column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 \u03bcm film), and interfaced to a 5977B MS. The chemical reagent tetramethylammonium hydroxide was added to the sample prior to pyrolysis in the TSP.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software.\n\nOverlay images registered using a novel image-based algorithm developed by Damon M. Conover (GW), John K. Delaney (GW, NGA), and Murray H. Loew (GW) of the George Washington University\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Don H.
