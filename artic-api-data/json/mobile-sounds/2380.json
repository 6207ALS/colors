Demonstratsiia! audio tour. I\u2019m Matt Witkovsky, curator in the Department of Photography at the Art Institute of Chicago. On the centenary of the 1917 Russian Revolution, we bring to you an exhibition that talks about the audiences and impact of early Soviet art. Where and how was Soviet art seen? By whom? For whom? And what can we learn today from the conversations opened up by that art? We hope you\u2019ll listen in on those conversations as you walk through the exhibition \u2014 please start in the \u201cBattleground\u201d section and then take any path you like. You\u2019ll also be hearing from Mark Steinberg, professor of history at the University of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana, and Kathleen Tahk, curatorial fellow here at the Art Institute.</p>\n",
