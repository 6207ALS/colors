    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This is a Shiva linga the phallic emblem of the god Shiva from about the fifth century A.D., a golden age which is regarded as one of the most beautiful periods of Indian art. The linga is traditionally regarded as a formless, abstract image of the god. Many linga\u2019s depict Shiva with four faces one in each of the cardinal directions. But this sculpture shows Shiva with a single tranquil face. Madhuvanti Ghose.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE:  You\u2019re seeing a very serene aspect of Shiva with his eyse lowered in meditation, his full lips and his matted hair locks which crowd over his head.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The linga is a sacred object which is worshipped as a way of communing with the god.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE:  Usually, a linga such as this, is scene in the sanctum of a Hindu which is called the womb house or the garbhagriha. It is right at the center underneath a very tall temple tower. And within that the sanctum is usually a very dark space like a cave. And the only thing in it would have been this Shiva linga.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Priests entering the shadowing inner sanctum anoint the linga with sacred substances such a streaks of bright vermillion pigment and sandalwood oil. They poured milk and other liquids over the linga as offerings to Shiva a god known both as a great lover and the destroyer of worlds.</p>\n",
