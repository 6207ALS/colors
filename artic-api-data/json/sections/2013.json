He probably served his apprenticeship in Philadelphia prior to establishing his shop in Wilmington; in later years he had connections to several Philadelphia silversmiths, purchasing finished objects and buckle components from William Ball in the 1760s and placing his son Isaac with Joseph Richardson, Jr. (see cat. 36 and cat. 37), in 1782. A tea service supplied to Sarah Sandwith Drinker of Philadelphia about 1787 comprised a teapot and milk pot by Richardson and a sugar bowl and waste bowl (or slop bowl, for unwanted dregs in teacups) by Woodcock. During the 1770s and 1780s Woodcock attended quarterly and annual Friends\u2019 Meetings in Philadelphia. Subsequently, after moving to western Pennsylvania, Woodcock still occasionally visited Philadelphia, with his friend Elizabeth Drinker, Sarah Sandwith Drinker\u2019s mother, recording in July 1802, \u201cBancroft Woodcock came here to tea with us\u2014he lives 260 miles off, he walk\u2019d 110 miles in three days; the rest he came in stages, has not been in this City for 7 or 8 years past.\u201d\n\nIn May 1754 Woodcock first advertised in the Pennsylvania Gazette as a goldsmith, having \u201cset up his business in Wilmington, near the upper Market House.\u201d For more than thirty-five years he operated what must have been the most prolific silversmith\u2019s shop in Delaware, producing an impressive array of forms in the Rococo and Neoclassical styles. As early as 1763 he also leased and acquired real estate in Wilmington, which provided additional income. Woodcock took several apprentices, including Richard Humphreys, a Quaker from Tortola, about 1765; his own son Isaac about 1777; William Poole about 1778; Woodcock\u2019s nephew Thomas Byrnes about 1780; and Elijah Wansey, \u201ca Mulatto apprentice lad,\u201d in 1790. That year Woodcock and Byrnes formed a partnership that Woodcock would end in 1793, when he began purchasing land in Bedford and Fulton counties, Pennsylvania. In 1794 he sold his remaining Wilmington properties and by 1796 settled in what would become Wells Township, Fulton County. Woodcock apparently continued to work as a craftsman in this rural setting; he was identified as \u201cgoldsmith\u201d when he sold land in Bedford County in 1796 and had dealings with Wilmington silversmith Ziba Ferris in 1807\u20138. At the time of his death, Woodcock still had his silversmith\u2019s tools; these he bequeathed to his son Isaac, who had purchased his father\u2019s farm in Fulton County in 1807.\n\nLike most of Woodcock\u2019s surviving work, the Art Institute\u2019s sugar bowl and milk pot are stylistically related to objects made in Philadelphia (see fig. 1). The sugar bowl\u2019s tall, double-domed cover, which provided ample space for decoration, was a form made by Philadelphia silversmiths such as George Christopher Dowig, John Letelier, Sr., and John Murdock. The lavish ornament of floral garlands is the sole example of chasing on silver marked by Woodcock or any of his contemporaries working in Delaware. The flowers chased on the milk pot\u2019s handle are likewise exceptional. Chasers were specialist craftsmen who sometimes sought work by traveling from city to city in the American colonies. However, given the absence of any further evidence of a chaser operating in Delaware as well as Woodcock\u2019s close ties to Philadelphia, it seems fair to assume that these pieces were decorated and possibly made in that city for Woodcock to sell.  \nDavid L.
