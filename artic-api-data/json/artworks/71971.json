    "description": "<p>Sanford Robinson Gifford was a key figure of the Hudson River School, the group of landscape painters that flourished in the New York region in the mid-19th century. The Catskill Mountains were an important subject for Gifford, who made drawings and oil sketches like this one during excursions in the area; such works often served as source material for larger compositions produced later in his studio. <em>Mist Rising at Sunset in the Catskills</em> is a swift, freely rendered depiction of evanescent mist above a pond and brilliantly illuminated clouds amid a low sun. Two men attending a boat on the shore give the mountainous scene a sense of grandeur despite the painting\u2019s small dimensions.</p>\n",
