    "description": "<p>Join Marielle Epstein, assistant director of Interpretation, to explore how Caravaggio\u2019s ethos resonate in the work of contemporary nightclub photographers.</p><p>Caravaggio\u2019s treatment of light, intense and revealing, gripped and repelled audiences throughout Rome. In his paintings, light illuminated the divine but also the grit of the streets and taverns he frequented. Caravaggio navigated this sometimes violent underworld not just as an observer but as a participant, and his intimate understanding informed his artistic expression.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-41b08225-7fff-a2e9-5655-eae4ece410d7\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br><br></span>Similar themes can also be found in the nightclub photography of contemporary artists like Nan Goldin and Wolfgang Tillmans. These works, like Caravaggio's paintings, explore pain, pleasure, violence, love, divination, sin, and redemption, offering a window into worlds that continue to captivate us.&nbsp;</p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p>Marielle Epstein is the assistant director of Interpretation at the Art Institute of Chicago.
