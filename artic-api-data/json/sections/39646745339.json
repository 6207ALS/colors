Born in New York on September 22, 1900, he was thirteen when he lost his father, a prominent chemical engineer who was president of United Coke and Gas Company and an art lover. He lost a great deal of money when an oven of his invention failed to go into production. The financial difficulties that followed prompted his widow to take her children to Germany to stay with family. There Schniewind was diagnosed with tuberculosis, underwent surgery, and spent much of 1914 through 1919 in a sanatorium in Leysin, Switzerland.\n\nSchniewind intended to become a doctor; he studied chemistry and medicine at the universities of Zurich and Bern, as well as Heidelberg, where he became sick again. He moved to Gstaad to recover, living there from 1924 to 1928. At some point, he was persuaded by his tutor and friend Kurt Kauenhoven to abandon the idea of a medical career for one in art. Seeking advice on how to prepare for a profession in art, Schniewind wrote to several eminent art historians, including Erwin Panofsky, who sent him a list of books to study and urged him to spend as much time as possible examining original artworks. Schniewind began to collect prints; his mother reputedly sent him a print by Honor\u00e9 Daumier on almost a weekly basis, and he began building a substantial library.\n\nUpon his recovery in 1928, he was able to pursue his education at the University of Heidelberg, from which he received a doctorate in art history, and to visit the great print cabinets of museums in Amsterdam, London, and Paris. Financial support from his mother allowed him to become an unpaid apprentice in the print-selling firm of Gutekunst and Klipstein in Bern; he was arranging to purchase a partnership in the company when the Great Depression hit. Confronted with financial challenges and a failed first marriage, he sold his Daumier collection at auction in Leipzig in May 1933. He remarried and moved with his new wife, Hedi Bretscher, to Paris. In October 1935, he was hired by the Brooklyn Museum to care for its print collection and direct its library.\n\nFor the Brooklyn Museum, he acquired early old master prints, but he is chiefly remembered for developing the collection of nineteenth- and twentieth-century French prints, staging exhibitions of examples by such artists as Henri Matisse (1935), Paul Gauguin (1938), and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1938). His interest in Gauguin was keen: in Brooklyn he worked on a revised edition of Marcel Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s 1927 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints. In May 1936, he assumed responsibility for the museum\u2019s drawings collection and named head of the newly reorganized Department of Prints and Drawings. The William A. Putnam Memorial Print Room, described as \u201cone of the most modern and best equipped print rooms in the country,\u201d opened on October 15, 1937.\n\nNonetheless, Schniewind was restless, and wrote to Daniel Catton Rich, Chief Curator and Director of Fine Arts at the Art Institute:\n\nFrom time to time I have heard that the Chicago Art Institute is considering the appointment of a curator for its Print Department. If this rumor has any foundation, I would like to submit my application for this position. My reason for contemplating a change is due to the fact that I should like to devote my entire time to curatorial work. At present, a great deal of my time is consumed with the administration and re-organization of the museum\u2019s library. I am not a librarian\u2014either by training or at heart, and I am trying therefore to give up this part of my present activities.\n\nSchniewind came to the Art Institute as Curator of Prints and Drawings in March 1940, bringing with him the as-yet-unfinished update of Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s catalogue. With funds from the generous 1938 bequest of Kate S. Buckingham in memory of her brother Clarence for the acquisition of prints, Schniewind set about enriching the Art Institute\u2019s trove of old master engravings and immediately organized, with Elizabeth Mongan (then curator of the Rosenwald Collection), a seminal exhibition, The First Century of Printmaking, 1400\u20131500 (1941). In concert with the enthusiasm of Chicago\u2019s cultural community for all things French, he augmented the museum\u2019s holdings of nineteenth-century French prints, including ninety-four examples by Gauguin (the current number in the museum today is 145) and 182 by Lautrec (the museum\u2019s representation totals 468). He cultivated a number of important patrons, such as Mrs. Potter Palmer and Margaret Day Blake, whose contributions helped the museum acquire important drawings. In addition to purchasing great examples by Rembrandt van Rijn, Jean-Antoine Watteau, and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Schniewind was a pioneer in seeking out artists\u2019 sketchbooks for the collection. He also distinguished himself in bringing before the Chicago public a major exhibition of the work of the seminal Mexican printmaker, Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada, the first time that Posada had ever been seen in the United States in more than a few examples.\n\nWhen Carl Schniewind died in Florence in August 1957\u2014from complications caused by his long struggle with tuberculosis\u2014he left the Art Institute with a remarkably strong collection of prints and drawings from the fifteenth century to the present. His successor in Chicago, Harold Joachim, along with Elizabeth Mongan, determined in 1963 to finish the Gauguin prints catalogue. Eberhard Kornfeld was finally able to complete the task in 1988, publishing a volume that remains the most complete record to date of Gauguin\u2019s prolific career as one of the most innovative printmakers of his generation.\n\n\n\\- - - - - -\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Mr. Carl O.

Schniewind (1900\u20131957), foreword by Daniel Catton Rich (Art Institute of Chicago, 1958), which the Art Institute issued as a catalogue to accompany a memorial exhibition of prints and drawings acquired during Schniewind\u2019s tenure as Curator of Prints and Drawings. Before Schniewind\u2019s appointment, the museum\u2019s collection of prints and drawings was supervised by collector-curator William McCallin McKee, Acting Curator Mildred J. Prentiss and Acting Curator Lilian Combs who did not have a college degree and began as a volunteer assistant to Ms. Prentiss in 1929.\n\nMarcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H. Floury, 1927; Alan Wofsy Fine Arts, 1980). In a letter to Peter Zegers of June 19, 1990, Brooklyn Museum archivist Deborah Wythe indicated that neither a catalogue nor a checklist was produced for the exhibition The Complete Graphic Work and a Selection of Paintings by Paul Gauguin (June 17\u2013Oct. 2, 1938), because Schniewind was involved with the revision of Gu\u00e9rin\u2019s book, which he expected to publish shortly.
