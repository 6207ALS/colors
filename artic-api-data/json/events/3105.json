    "description": "<p>Alongside massive urbanization in the 1990s, Chinese contemporary artists turned toward the city as the subject, site, and raw material for their practice. This talk focuses on the Big Tail Elephant, one of the earliest groups to create public site-specific performance art in China.</p><p><strong >Nancy P. Lin </strong>is a doctoral student in the Department of Art History at the University of Chicago. She received the 2015 Art Institute Schiff Foundation Writing Fellowship and, together with fellow collaborators, is the recipient of the 2016 Graham Foundation project grant for the forthcoming publication <em>Building Subjects</em>, a survey of collective housing in China. Her article on the Big Tail Elephant Working Group is included in the forthcoming edited volume Urbanized Interfaces, which will examine the relationship between urbanization, visual arts, and architecture in contemporary China.</p>",
