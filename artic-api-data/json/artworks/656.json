    "description": "<p>Iconic guardians of the Art Institute of Chicago, the <em>Lions</em> have stood at the Michigan Avenue entrance since the building\u2019s inaugural year. The site became the museum\u2019s permanent home at the conclusion of the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, where the new structure had hosted lectures and other events for fairgoers. Modeled by Edward Kemeys, an essentially self-taught artist and the nation\u2019s first great animalier (sculptor of animals), the lion pair was unveiled on May 10, 1894. Kemeys focused his talents on sculptural portrayals of North American wildlife, capturing such native creatures in anatomical, naturalistic detail. For the Art Institute, he modeled larger-than-life African lions, the one positioned north of the steps <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/230193\">\u201con the prowl\u201d</a> (1893.1b) and the lion to the south \u201cin an attitude of defiance,\u201d in Kemeys\u2019s words. These behavioral distinctions are visible in the variation of head, tail, and stance. Each weighing in at more than two tons, the <em>Lions</em> were cast in Chicago by the American Bronze Founding Company.</p>\n",
