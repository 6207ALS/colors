    "description": "<p>Linda Connor moved to Chicago to study with Aaron Siskind at the Institute of Design (ID); her 1969 master\u2019s thesis consisted of collages and pictures of pictures. \u201cI loved getting family pictures and old albums and pulling toward the past,\u201d she later said, attributing some of her interest in family photographs to the fact of her being adopted. Hugh Edwards acquired her work while she was still a student, adding 10 photographs to the collection between 1967 and 1969; he often bet on the potential of young photographers, especially students at the ID.</p>\n",
