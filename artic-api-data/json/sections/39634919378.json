Recent research on the relationship of the Impressionists to the theme reveals that\u2014despite the appeal of such images for potential buyers\u2014only about one-sixth of Gauguin\u2019s painted oeuvre deals with the genre. About half of these date between 1884 and 1890, with only five such compositions completed between 1893 and 1898. The appeal of floral motifs for the artist in those years is suggested by his inclusion of a vibrant watercolor in his 1893\u20131901 bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 128.2).\n\nHowever, as Mary Hannah Byers noted, Gauguin at times seems to have equated the mode of still life with the absence of inspiration. In 1899 he wrote to his dear and most loyal friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, \u201cWhen I am able to paint again, if I have no imagination, I shall do some studies of flowers. . . . It is a great pleasure for me.\u201d In the fall of that year, the dealer Ambroise Vollard wrote Gauguin to request large watercolors and floral still lifes: \u201cIf you care to do some flower paintings . . . I will take a whole series of them; in short I am willing to buy everything you do.\u201d The artist\u2019s response was \u201ctesty,\u201d as Douglas Druick noted. \u201cHe observed that Tahiti was \u2018not really a land of flowers\u2019 and that in any event he painted few floral still lifes because \u2018as you have doubtless perceived, I do not paint from nature.\u2019\u201d In the same letter, Gauguin added, \u201cWith me everything happens in my crazy imagination and when I tire of painting figures (my preference) I begin a still life and finish it without any model.\u201d\n\nGauguin thanked Monfreid in another letter of 1899 for sending iris, dahlia, and gladioli seeds that he had planted in his garden and that were flourishing there. The Art Institute\u2019s watercolor Still Life with Cat and a related painting, Flowers and Cats (fig. 128.3 [W 592]), most likely date from that time. Executed on deluxe Japanese paper with powdered pigment (couleurs en poudre) sent by Vollard, the museum\u2019s large watercolor seems to respond to the dealer\u2019s request. The bouquet comprises a number of tropical plants, including blooms with close affinities to oleander, frangipani, Rosebush Mussaenda, White Wing Mussaenda, cherimoya, and passionflowers (see fig. 128.4). The profusion of flowers, bursts of color, and energetic brushwork belies the fact that, not long before, in 1898, the artist was suffering from acute depression and had attempted suicide. Neither the painting nor the watercolor offers any obvious reference to the artist\u2019s location in Polynesia.\n\nIn order to expand the still-life genre into more than mere observation, from the beginning of his painting career Gauguin often introduced accessories to his floral compositions. The inclusion of sphinxlike cats in these two floral still lifes offers a discordant, slightly sinister note, supporting Mary Hannah Byers\u2019s observation that \u201coften Gauguin\u2019s intention was to establish a visual disparity between the objects portrayed and the overall mood of the painting.\u201d Cats are relatively rare in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre, appearing in early works often involving children (see fig. 128.5 [W 135]). Cats of course inhabited Gauguin\u2019s world in Polynesia, and cats or catlike creatures can be found in his paintings, such Te rerioa (The Dream) of 1897 (fig. 128.6 [W 557]), but, as Gloria Groom has noted, they are usually benign, sleeping cats rather than the slightly threatening, sphinxlike cat in of later works (see cat. 123). In terms of the fluid watercolor handling, the Art Institute work compares to a charming watercolor from around 1897 (fig. 128.7) with vignettes of a cat moving around the sheet, before settling in. In contrast, the felines in the oil and Art Institute watercolor seem frozen\u2014more like ceramic statues than living beings\u2014transforming the works\u2019 vibrant bouquets into something mysterious and eternal.\n\nIn 1901 Gauguin executed two still lifes that incorporate Tahitian figures, fruit, and vaguely figurative elements: Still Life with Sunflowers on an Armchair (fig. 128.8 [W 603]) and Sunflowers and Mangoes (private collection [W 606]). The transplanted European sunflower was a clear reference to his relationship with Vincent van Gogh. Both compositions include a disquieting presence, an \u201ceye-flower,\u201d a Symbolist motif derived from a famous lithograph by Redon, hovering in the background.\n\nWriting to Gauguin on August 14, 1903, Monfreid referred to the painting Still Life with Cats, contemplating the possibility that he could sell it to Vollard, who loved cats. Sadly, Gauguin never read this letter, which was returned to the sender labeled \u201cdeceased.\u201d  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Mr. Maurice P.
