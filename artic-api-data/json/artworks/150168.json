This silk velvet yardage is woven to shape, creating pattern pieces for a full-sleeved, short jacket that overlaps in front and would have been worn in informal domestic settings. To avoid wasting the expensive fabric, covers for matching shoes and other accessories were incorporated into the pattern in between the larger pieces.</p>\n",
