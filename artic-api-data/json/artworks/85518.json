    "description": "<p>Featherworks are challenging for scholars to interpret because they are rare and so materially different from more common woven textiles made by the same cultures. Motifs have various colors because of the vibrant plumages of the birds and have altered forms because of how the artists sewed the strands of feathers to the ground cloths. This tabard is distinct from more common tunics because it was not originally sewn up the sides. A very similar garment in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has been scientifically dated to 1298\u20131397.</p>\n",
