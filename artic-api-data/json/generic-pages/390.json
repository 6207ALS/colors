    "copy": " Fellowships at the Art Institute of Chicago While internships focus on training, fellowships help support advanced-level professionalization and the enrichment of an early-career (or in some cases an established) scholar\u2019s primary field of expertise or professional practice. Fellowships are typically of a longer duration than internships, spanning from one academic year through three calendar years. They are predominantly full-time, salaried placements.   At the Art Institute, fellowships largely revolve around collections\u2014in terms of either research, curatorial practice, conservation, education, or interpretation. For the most part, Art Institute fellows are embedded on department projects where their expertise enables them to make a substantial contribution while at the same time expanding professional competencies. Because of the longer time frame, the level and degree of scholarly research or writing expected and the aim of advanced-level professionalization, fellowships most often appear as options at the graduate, post-graduate, pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, or senior levels of academic training.
