    "description": "<p>Attending the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before and after the First World War, Miller described himself as \u201cconspicuously absent\u2014I wasn\u2019t a good student.\u201d Yet Miller continued to develop his artistic abilities, working in a variety of media such as sculpture, stained glass, painting, woodcarving, and tile. Despite this versatility, however, Miller wrote in 1936 that he was \u201cjust barely beginning to find [himself].\u201d This painting was awarded the Watson F. Blair Purchase Prize in 1934 at the <em>13th Exhibition of Watercolors, Pastels, Drawings, and Monotypes</em>, and the work entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection. <em>Chicago Tribune</em> art critic Eleanor Jewett described this work in her exhibition review as an \u201cImpression-istic Easter card.\u201d</p>\n",
