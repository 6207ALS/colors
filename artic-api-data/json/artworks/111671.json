The paintings originally formed the interior of the wings of a folding triptych with the <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> as its center. Both show gifts being presented to a ruler on his throne and would have been understood as Old Testament prefigurations of the submission of the nations to Christ as king, the theme of the lost <em>Adoration</em> panel. They also provided an excuse for the artist to depict exotic costumes, architecture, and luxury goods\u2014 the hallmarks of the Antwerp Mannerist style.</p>\n",
