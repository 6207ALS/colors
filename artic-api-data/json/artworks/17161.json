    "description": "<p>In the late 18th century, the French Academy promoted a severely Classical approach to history painting as a means to regenerate art\u2014and in contrast to the perceived decadence of the Rococo style. Jacques-Louis David and his students were leading exponents of this Neoclassical approach, treating antique subjects as moral exemplars for contemporary audiences. Here, David\u2019s student Jean-Baptiste Wicar depicted the response of the Roman emperor Augustus and his family to Virgil\u2019s reading of his epic poem the Aeneid, which tells the story of Aeneas, the Trojan prince who settled in Latium after many adventures and was viewed as an ancestor of Augustus. The emotionally charged gestures of Augustus and his sister Octavia suggest that they identify their own family drama with the heroic events recounted by Virgil.</p>\n",
