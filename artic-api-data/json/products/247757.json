    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Our current logo, designed in 2008 by Abbott Miller, partner of Pentagram. It echoes the engraved letters on the classical frieze above the Michigan Avenue entrance, the Roman \u201cV\u201d of our fa\u00e7ade firmly rooting the Art Institute\u2019s identity in tradition. At the same time, the design and font are clean and modern, reflecting an institution that is also very much engaged with the art of our time. Though stacked vertically, the words \u201cArt,\u201d \u201cInstitute,\u201d and \u201cChicago\u201d each have equal weight, reflecting our continued commitment to our collection, our mission as an educational institution, and our deep connection to our city and our community.</p><ul><li><strong>Single Magnet</strong></li><li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>&nbsp;2.25 x 2.25 x .25 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Acrylic</li></ul>",
