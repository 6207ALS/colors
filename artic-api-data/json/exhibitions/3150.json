    "short_description": "Shigaraki wares, featuring rough textured clay and natural ash glazes, are one of the characteristic types of Japanese ceramics first produced in earnest in the Kamakura period (1185-1333). Named after a valley southeast of Kyoto, where many of the old kilns that produced the wares were situated, they were originally primarily utilitarian objects that were used in kitchens or storerooms to hold seeds or other ingredients. The white clay bodises of such wares turn colors when scorched in a kiln, and the use of wood ash can form a greenish glaze over them.",
