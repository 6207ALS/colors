Because Marian\u2019s death was a suicide and the couple was fascinated by Asian cultures, Henry asked Saint-Gaudens to avoid Christian symbolism and instead evoke the \u201ccontemplative compassion derived from Buddhist philosophy.\u201d When Chicago architect Daniel Burnham visited Saint-Gaudens in 1892, he saw a plaster cast of the figure\u2019s head and was enthralled by its mysterious yet meditative quality. In 1893, perhaps in celebration of Chicago\u2019s World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, Saint-Gaudens gave the bust to Burnham, who later had four bronzes cast from it.</p>\n",
