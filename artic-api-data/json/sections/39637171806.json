He used a small piece of coarsely grained wood, in contrast to the fine-grained boxwood used for Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) and Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). As in his Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105), this wood likely derived from an indigenous source that Gauguin himself prepared for carving and printing. Tahitians, Flowers and Leaves was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues of Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThe impression was printed in black ink.\n\nThe paper is a poor quality, machine-made wove paper similar to that used for a variety of headpieces, including Bust of a Nude Woman and Three-Quarter Figure of a Man with a White Cap in Profile, Third Small Figure at Far Right (cat. 121). The paper is moderately sized such that the ink was not readily absorbed nor did the paper conform to the contours of the block to lift ink more fully from its surface. This is in contrast to a second impression in the Art Institute\u2019s collection printed on an absorbent Japanese paper, which took the ink more readily from the block, resulting in a softer, richer impression (cat. 119.1).\n\nThe paper was hand torn along the bottom edge. The long horizontal format suggests that a larger sheet was used to print multiple blocks at the same time, after which it was cut up. This format is alluded to in Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti. Gauguin adhered three prints onto page 186 (fig. 119.2.2). Their vertical stacking may well point to the artist\u2019s method of printing several blocks concurrently (see cat. 84.1, fig. 84.1.3).\n\nResidual paper strips were removed from the edges of the print. Undulations and handling dents were reduced.\n\nThe print is sound, stable condition. There is residual ink present in the upper left corner on the recto; on the verso fingerprints and smudges of ink appear.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
