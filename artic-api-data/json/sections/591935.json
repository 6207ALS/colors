Blown in a three-part mold and tooled. Uneven rim, slightly flared, flattened, and infolded, sits on a free-blown cylindrical neck that spreads out to a tall convex shoulder on an ovoid body. The lower part of the body, similar to the shoulder, is also convex in profile but tapers inward more sharply. The wall bends in and down to form a small stepped base, slightly concave on the underside. The mold-blown decoration on the shoulder consists of six arches, with an indistinct ovoid or conical element within each.\n\nThe central decoration below is an arcade with columns that support an architrave or horizontal band on which rest the arches of the shoulder. The columns are well delineated, all sharing a continuous horizontal baseline. The smooth shaft of the column rests on a double torus base and supports a torus capital below a wide abacus. Between the columns are six vessels: a footed pitcher with one handle on the right; a low-footed bowl with two high handles, filled with large rounded elements, perhaps fruit; a footed, wide-mouth vessel with two vertical handles on the shoulder; a tall-footed krater with a tall cylindrical neck, wide mouth, and flared rim, filled with rounded fruit; a second footed pitcher with one handle on the right; and a second footed, wide-mouth vessel with two vertical handles on the shoulder.\n\nThe decoration below the baseline of the main register is a hanging garland that runs from the center of each panel below the vessels to a point under the column. Above the center of each swag hang large dimpled elements, perhaps bunches of grapes alternating with a large fruit or possibly a mask. There is a distinct mold-blown stepped base, slightly concave on the underside, with a three-part mold line that runs up onto the side of the base. For a zoomable image, see fig. 107.1.\n\nThe bottle is intact, unweathered with some surface pitting.\n\nThe rim of this bottle is more evenly infolded and delicately worked than the related opaque white bottle (cat. 105), but the decorative cycle here is far more common.\n\nThe few excavated examples of this type have been documented by Marianne Stern. There are numerous bottles in public and private collections worldwide. More recently published vessels are in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, the Princeton University Art Museum, and the Corning Museum of Glass, with relevant citations of earlier published examples in their catalogues. David Whitehouse, in his comments on the Corning parallel, commented on Stern\u2019s research. He also noted earlier authors Gustavus Eisen, Anita Engle, and Dan Barag and their views about the kind of temple in which these types of ritual vessels would have been used: the Second Temple in Jerusalem or possibly a temple of Ashtoreth, the Sidonian Venus, or a temple in the Roman city of Berytus (modern Beirut).  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Stern, Roman Mold-Blown Glass, p. 115.\n\nIsraeli, Ancient Glass in the Israel Museum, pp. 132\u201333, nos. 135\u201337, p. 109 (color illus.).\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 78, no. 79.\n\nWhitehouse, Roman Glass 2, pp. 36\u201337, no. 506, p. 319 (profile and line drawing).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 107 Bottle, 1st century A.D.\n\nfig. 107.1 Bottle (1st century A.D.).
