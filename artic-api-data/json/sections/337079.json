As Whistler plainly stated in a letter to the Ways, this lithograph and La Belle Dame endormie (cat. 108) were drawn on the evening of 22 September 1894, making them among the most precisely dated images in his lithographic oeuvre (letter 121). In this important letter, the artist specified the titles and paper he wished the printers to use for the two new drawings and recorded some of the visual effects he had tried to achieve: \u201cI rely on their simplicity for their success. I send also more paper\u2014very lovely Dutch and I think just a pretty size\u2014we will call No. 1 \u2018La Robe Rouge\u2019\u2014I rather want to see how the colour is conveyed!\u2014\u2018you\u2019 will think me quite crazy!\u2014No. 2 \u2018La Dormeuse.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Ways had already transferred the two portraits to stone by September 25, when Whistler wrote to his printers: \u201cI am glad to hear that the three drawings are all right on stone and look well\u2014for I do so want to be sure of the material. . . . These last two drawings ought to give excellent results\u2014but don\u2019t know\u201d (letter 122). We can reasonably assume, based on Whistler\u2019s subsequent correspondence with the Ways, that the \u201cthree drawings\u201d to which the artist referred in that letter were La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle (cat. 106), La Robe rouge, and La Belle Dame endormie (cat. 108). When Whistler received the proofs of La Robe rouge in early October 1894, he ordered \u201cup to twenty\u201d impressions, saying that he might wish to \u201ctouch the stone\u201d during an anticipated visit to London (letter 125). He never made those changes to the stone, and there is no record of what disturbed him in the drawing; however, it seems likely that he was troubled by the slight defects caused by creases in the transfer paper. When the image was transferred to supplementary stones for the large Studio edition in November 1895, the printers were able to remove several of these crease marks and reduce others. Whistler must have approved their corrections, for he signed several second-state impressions.\n\nDrawn on a loose sheet of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, the image shows the rubbed imprint of two vertical lines, spaced 85 mm apart, one passing through the seat of the couch and down through the left portion of the sitter\u2019s skirt and the other from the highest point of her shoulder on the right and down across her arm. There are also two areas within the image where the paper appears to have creased slightly as the drawing was made. One diagonal crease mark crosses the left portion of the skirt toward the sitter\u2019s knee. Three short horizontal marks cross the small patches of shadow at left near the bottom of the skirt. A white spot can be seen within the heavy vertical strokes on the right edge of the sitter\u2019s skirt.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (324 \u00d7 208 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory laid paper (240 \u00d7 181 mm); SC, ivory laid paper (333 \u00d7 212 mm).

The second-state alterations were made on the supplementary stones rather than on the \u201cmother stone.\u201d The imprints of two parallel vertical lines (passing through the seat of the couch and down through the left portion of the sitter\u2019s skirt and from the highest point of her shoulder on the right and down across her arm) have been removed. The diagonal line from creasing in the transfer paper (crossing the left portion of the skirt toward the area of the sitter\u2019s knees) has been reduced and made less obvious. Three short horizontal lines (crossing the small patches of shadow at left near the bottom of the skirt) have been largely removed. The white spot (within the heavy vertical strokes at the lower right edge of the sitter\u2019s skirt) has been filled.\n\nThere are impressions of the second state printed on the paper used for the periodical edition but lacking the blind stamp. A few of these were signed in graphite by the artist, suggesting that he approved the changes made on the supplementary stones for The Studio.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (297 \u00d7 215 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Cambridge, Mass., FAM (2); Cincinnati, CAM; and Cleveland, CMA.\n\nPublished edition. The majority of second-state impressions were machine printed by Way for the supplement included in the 15 November 1895 issue of The Studio. They were printed on ivory laid paper, now often discolored to cream, with a smooth surface recto and a textured surface verso. The sheets may have at least one deckle edge.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (295 \u00d7 208 mm), with blind stamp, rebound.

London: NAL, cream laid paper (280 \u00d7 200 mm), with blind stamp, bound. Washington: LC, cream laid paper (295 \u00d7 209 mm), with blind stamp.\n\nRemarks: Impressions from the periodical edition are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, BPL and MFA; Cincinnati, CAM; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.
