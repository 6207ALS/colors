    "description": "<p>In April 1935, New York gallerist Julien Levy included this photograph in the exhibition <em>Documentary and Anti-Graphic Photographs</em>, which brought the work of Manuel Alvarez Bravo together with that of Walker Evans and Henri Cartier-Bresson. For Levy, the \u201canti-graphic\u201d photograph renounced conventional fine-art qualities\u2014rich tonality, sharp focus, and clear description\u2014to achieve something that was \u201cdynamic, startling, and inimitable.\u201d Alvarez Bravo\u2019s photograph of cardboard mannequins at an open-air market in Mexico City exemplifies this ideal by evoking seemingly unpremeditated associations within a mundane setting. The imagination, stimulated by such a sight, is liberated through what the Surrealist Andr\u00e9 Breton called \u201cobjective chance.\u201d As the title of this work suggests, a reversal of potentialities operates here: the stall keepers and their customers are listless and uninterested, whereas the inanimate cardboard women floating in the air engage the viewer with vivacious smiles and alluring gazes.</p>\n",
