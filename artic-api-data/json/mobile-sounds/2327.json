    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: While living in his Paris studio, Gauguin wrote a fictionalized memoir about his time in Tahiti, called Noa Noa. To illustrate it, he created a series of ten prints, known as the Noa Noa Suite, using a method he invented.</p>\n<p>HARRIET STRATIS: Charles Maurice, a poet and friend of Gauguin, called Noa Noa  a book to be seen as well as read. What you\u2019re seeing when you stand in front of \u201cNave Nave Fenua\u201d is one of a group of 10 woodblock prints that Gauguin made upon his return to Paris, after his first stay in Tahiti. The imagery represented in \u201cNave Nave Fenua\u201d is not unusual to Gauguin\u2019s series of \u201cEve.\u201d On the curved wall to your left, you\u2019ll see the same figure in a variety of media: pastel, watercolor, and oil. But in this print, Eve is at her most crude and mysterious. There is an aura of darkness around her due to the way he rolled printing ink onto his block. Rather that carve the wood blocks as they were intended, he mixed the fine, delicate lines of wood engraving with the deep, broad gouging of woodcut techniques. Looking at the block below the print, you can see all the different types of lines and incisions that he was able do with small number of tools.</p>\n<p>Gauguin\u2019s innovation didn\u2019t stop with the carving of the blocks. When you go to the display case in the center of the gallery, and have a look at a series of prints of \u201cTe Atua\u201d, you will see the variety of colors, and a variety of different textural and tonal effects he that he could achieve printing from the same block. And, this was all done with an eye towards creating the unique, looking for what accidentally occurred, those happy accidents when you put a piece of paper onto a block that has all these manipulated media and you pull it off, transferring the ink to the paper, not really knowing what you\u2019re going to get until you turn that piece of paper over to see the result.
