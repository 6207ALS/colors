    "description": "<p>Associate curator of modern and contemporary art Robyn Farrell discusses the exhibition <em>David Hockney: The Arrival of Spring, Normandy, 2020.</em></p><p>A defining figure of the British Pop Art movement, Hockney is known for his vivid landscapes, domestic scenes, and intimate portraits. Two years ago, Hockney traveled to France with the express intention of capturing the arrival of spring and created a series of joyful paintings using the medium of the iPad. In this lecture, Farrell will contextualize this most recent series within Hockney's six-decade practice.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
