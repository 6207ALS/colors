Robinson, 1949.1289\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent deep-blue, green, yellow-green, dark-green, and opaque white, yellow, pink, and red glass. Mosaic glass technique, assembled from sections of multiple canes, then tooled and polished on its upper surface. The design consists of a transparent deep-blue matrix in which there are three complete floral elements, parts of two petals, and the center of a large flower. The bottom of the inlay preserves fragmentary round canes composed of three concentric circles of white, yellow, and greenish yellow; the central white cane has radiating spokes of green. Two fragmentary petals radiate from the center, each composed of arcs of yellow, white, pink, and red. Between these petals is a yellow, eight-petaled, fan-shaped flower with white tips; each petal is notched with a sharp V-shaped indentation. The base of the flower is a yellow-green sphere with darker-green arcs that suggest a scaly surface. The base sits on a long, lighter-yellow-green stem with a thin, saw-toothed, vertical leaf curving out and away from the stem on either side. Floating in the matrix above this flower and slightly to the left is what looks like an upright cluster of stylized grapes; nine yellow spheres are each cased in a thin layer of white and supported below by a yellow stem that runs down and bends sharply to the left. To the right is a white six-pointed flower with a yellow center entirely filled by a small central red cane and six surrounding canes.\n\nBroken on three sides; the face has been repolished. The back retains its original fire polish and irregular surface.\n\nThis plaque seems to be an Egyptian production; almost all excavated examples come from there. David Grose and Gladys Weinberg noted the sites of Asyut, Antino\u00f6polis, Bahnasa (ancient Oxyrhynchos), Alexandria, Chatby near Alexandria, a site near Tel Anafa in Upper Galilee, and possibly Dendera and Karanis. In her description of the plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Marsha Hill suggested that these inlays were manufactured in Middle Egypt.\n\nJudging from the large size of these plaques, originally six by three inches, they were probably used as wall revetment elements as well as on furniture. Grose noted and illustrated ten or eleven flower types among the fragments, but the vegetal motifs are difficult to identify in most cases. The only firm identification seems to be the Nelumbo lotus flower that is found consistently on many plaques. The Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s plaque and the Art Institute\u2019s example share a bunch of grapes and two flowers: a small six-petaled white one with a red center, and a large red, white, and yellow multileafed element at one end of the plaque. Most plaques are backed with a muddy gray-blue glass that may have bits of unused cane to add thickness. The design is not seen on the back of this larger group of fragments. There is a wide variation of flowers and combinations in the fragments. While the grape cluster, the white-petaled flower with a red center, and the larger red-tipped flowers on the Art Institute\u2019s piece can be found in many other fragments, the central yellow fan-shaped flower with white tips and paired elegant leaves seems to be more unusual. There is a variation of the flower on two fragments in the Miho Museum in Shiga, Japan, that have a central flower of yellow-cased red petals with a similar flower of yellow petals with white tips on either side.\n\nThere is a second group of more refined plaques discussed by Grose, as there are fragments of both types in the Toledo Museum of Art. The second group is more carefully fabricated; the ground color is more intense and homogeneous and the design can be seen on both sides of the plaque. Weinberg excavated a fragment of this material near Tel Anafa in Israel at a test excavation site they named Three Trees. Weinberg discussed both types of plaques in useful detail\u2014much of the material at that time had not been widely studied. Given the number of fragments that exist, the use of these plaques as architectural revetment must have been spectacular. Roman palatial interiors had fine painting, marble revetment, and mosaics. Adding mosaic glass plaques as a border or divider may have been just the excess that an architect needed or an owner desired. Pliny, who often lamented the wealth that was pouring into Rome and destroying its very fabric, described a theater built in 58 B.C. by M. Scaurus, the stepson of Sulla.\u201cIn his aedileship he constructed the greatest of all works ever made by human hand. . . . This was his theater. . . . The lower storey of the stage was made of marble, the middle of glass (an unheard of luxury, even later on), and the highest storey was covered with gilded panels. The columns of the lower storey . . . were thirty-eight feet high. . . . The bronze statues between the columns numbered . . . three thousand in all. . . . The auditorium itself held 80,000 people.\u201d Areas of Nero\u2019s Domus Aurea still retain glass gems and inlays that highlight interior architectural elements and add an incredible richness to the surface. See the descriptions of wall revetment fragments in the Corning Museum of Glass in the related examples for the five fragments of wall revetment (cats. 94\u201398).\n\nElaborate glass panels with figural or geometric designs were created with shaped pieces of colored glass. These were often enhanced with mosaic glass elements all generally described as opus sectile and documented well into the late Roman Empire. Crates of opus sectile panels were found at the fourth-century-A.D. site of Kenchreai, the eastern port of Corinth. The panels show a range of designs including Nilotic scenes. There are also two related panels in the Corning Museum of Glass: one is the upper part of a figural procession with a man\u2019s head identified as Thomas and the other is a panel of birds in a thicket. The former consists of elements of preformed glass assembled and supported by an adhesive backing; the latter is of preformed glass elements fused in a glass backing. Both confirm the continuation of sumptuous decorative interiors in the late empire.\n\nThe most complete example appears to be in the British Museum; it is frequently cited but not extensively published. Another wonderful plaque in the Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 80.1) is a variation on the Art Institute\u2019s fragment. The Toledo Museum of Art has a number of examples of both types of plaques, and the Miho Museum has a fine group. There are examples in the Corning Museum of Glass, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the National Museums Scotland, and the Princeton University Art Museum. A number of fragments have been sold from several private Egyptian collections to European and American markets.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This fragment was published in Casagrande-Kim, When the Greeks Ruled, pp. 24\u201325, nos. 1\u20139, 134; Luckner, \u201cAncient Glass,\u201d p. 78 (illus.), for a backlit image of the fragment showing the distinct clusters of canes employed to create the design.\n\nSee Grose, Early Ancient Glass, pp. 355\u201356, nn. 31\u201332, for references; Weinberg, \u201cNotes on Glass from Upper Galilee,\u201d pp. 47\u201351, figs. 5\u20136; Brecia, La Necropoli di Sciatbi, pp. 104\u201305, figs. 70 and 74, for the Chatby reference; Harden, Roman Glass from Karanis, p. 300, no. 960, for a floral plaque fragment that was described but not illustrated; Root, Wondrous Glass Reflections on the World of Rome, p. 17, pl. 18c, d, illustrating two plaques from Karanis; Petrie, Dendereh, pp. 35\u201336, for inlays that seem to be unrelated to these floral plaques according to the descriptions.
