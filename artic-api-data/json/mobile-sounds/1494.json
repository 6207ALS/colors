    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Vermont, where this jar was made around 1830, was known for its redware, or pottery made from red-toned clay. Curator Judy Barter.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: It's exceptionally elaborate in its decoration, a lot of stamped bands of geometric designs. And the glazes are particularly beautiful, with those green swags and the little ruffles around the neck. So it's a very sophisticated piece of pottery, made by someone who was very dexterous.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The center of the jar is stamped with the maker's name: E. W. Ferrar [ph?]. In this case, you will also see two fascinating examples of jugs shaped as faces.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: The two face jugs are examples of pottery made in the South, where anthropomorphic type forms were quite popular. And we think that some of these were made by slaves.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: By the mid-nineteenth century, ceramics were sometimes produced by slaves. Some were from Central Africa, where there was an important tradition of making jugs in human forms. The jugs may have been used for drinking, or even to place on graves. Face jugs were evidently very important possessions. Examples have been found all along the underground railroad, used by slaves escaping to the North.</p>\n",
