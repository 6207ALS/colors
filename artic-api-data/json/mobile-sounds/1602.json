    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This moving portray of an enslaved man was painted in England in 1827 by John Philip Simpson. The artist conveys a powerful sense of the man\u2019s dignity and intelligence, and unmistakable condemnation of his situation. Our attention is caught by the shackles around the man\u2019s wrist. It is also drawn to the expression in his face which suggests profound sadness, stoically born. The man looks up as if toward a window that lets a meager amount of light into his dismal surroundings. This light falls on his face. It emphasizes his eyes and forehead, and thus his senses and intellect. In other words, his humanity. Simpson made this painting at the height of the British abolitionists\u2019 fervent campaign to end slavery in the British empire. The painting was exhibited publicly in London where it attracted much attention. One critic declared, \u201cIt is true in all its bearings, and appeals directly to the heart.\u201d The captive slave in Simpson\u2019s painting may have been modeled by Ira Aldridge, a freeborn African American from New York who became a celebrated Shakespearean actor on the London stage.</p>\n",
