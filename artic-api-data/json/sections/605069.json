The rim, rounded by reheating, flares out from a long cylindrical neck. The vessel wall spreads out to form a convex shoulder and bends inward to a short, tapering body. The underside has a high kick with a pontil mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 121.1.\n\nThe bottle is broken and repaired with some small losses, pitted surface. It has an overall brilliant iridescence.\n\nThis bottle is a very simple form but retains brilliant iridescence. There are two other ordinary vessels that have been selected for publication owing to their spectacular coloration: see cat. 119 and cat. 120.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 121 Bottle, 1st/2nd century A.D.\n\nfig. 121.1 Bottle (1st/2nd century A.D.).
