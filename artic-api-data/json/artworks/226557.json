She has described the evolution and creation of this drawing: \u201cIn the early 70s, I was rethinking works on paper and looking for a way to make drawings that were nonobjective, exacting, linear, and true to my sensibility. This is how I arrived at the idea that I wanted to make drawings within paper not on it; paper itself was the underpinning of content.\u201d</p>\n",
