Robinson, 1947.954\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Colorless with a greenish tinge and translucent aquamarine glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rounded rim tapers to a hollow tooled-out horizontal rib forming a vertical collar. Below this collared rim, the neck constricts sharply then spreads out into a globular body with a flattened base that is kicked and retains a pontil mark. The largest diameter is decorated with a register that is defined by a single upper trail and two fine trails of vessel glass below, which are left in relief. The space in between is filled by a thicker zigzag trail of aquamarine. Below this register and defined at the base by a thin trail of aquamarine is a second series of irregular aquamarine zigzags. Three heavy gathers of aquamarine were applied equidistant from each other at the shoulder and pulled up and then down along the collared rim and tooled to form handles. For a zoomable image, see fig. 132.1.\n\nThe jar is intact; there are patches of incrustation and irregular weathering crust with some brilliant iridescence. The iridescence is uneven overall.\n\nThis is a rare, large example of a rather common form. These jars and unguentaria with multiple compartments gave glassmakers a chance to demonstrate their skill. In some cases they trailed on glass decoration and delicate handles until the vessels became so elaborate as to be unusable.\n\nVessels of this type are well known from excavations in Palestine. There are more average-size jars from Beit Fajjar and the Mount of Olives, Jerusalem. A jar of this type, also quite large, in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art demonstrated one-upmanship by adding complicated multiple handles around the rim, an openwork basket handle over the top, and a unique flared and folded foot with equally elaborate applied \u201chandles\u201d that mirror their tooled counterpart on the rim. Other, more recent parallels are from a private collection in the Netherlands and one offered on the American market.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Whitehouse, Roman Glass 2, pp. 192\u201399, nos. 742\u201352, for a series of these well-known forms in the Corning Museum of Glass.\n\nSee Whitehouse, Roman Glass 2, pp. 198\u201399, no. 752, for a four-compartment unguentarium that is probably the most complex example preserved.
