Listed in the 1816 Baltimore city directory as a \u201cfree householder of Colour,\u201d he had been freed by his enslaver (and father) around 1782 after apprenticing as a blacksmith. Described as \u201cself-taught\u201d in a newspaper advertisement, Johnson attracted local patrons for his portraits from the city\u2019s artisan and middle-class families.</p>\n<p>Elizabeth Beatty is fashionably dressed, wearing a circlet of glass beads that accentuates her brown hair and gray eyes. The child\u2019s clothes are equally elegant; she sports a high-waisted, white-muslin gown and holds a brightly colored strawberry, a delicacy often featured in Johnson\u2019s portraits.</p>\n",
