    "copy": " This book for children and adults of all ages features the life of Georges Seurat, who, at the remarkably young age of 31, made his most famous painting, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884 (1884\u201386). Long a favorite work of visitors to the Art Institute of Chicago, it has resided in the museum since 1926. Seurat and \"La Grande Jatte\" is illustrated with the artist\u2019s work as well as with the art he learned from, including ancient Egyptian sculpture and French Impressionist painting. The book describes how the young painter prepared himself to execute this monumental composition, which depicts more than 40 Parisians spending leisure time in an island park on the outskirts of the city: he developed his remarkable \"colored dot\" technique and made many pencil and oil sketches of the work\u2019s various elements. In clear and engaging language, children\u2019s-book writer Robert Burleigh artfully explains many aspects of this complex painting and suggests ways of considering its fascinating mysteries.   Robert Burleigh   32 pages, 9 1/4 x 12 1/4 in. 21 color ills. Out of print ISBN: 978-0-810-94811-2 (hardcover) ",
