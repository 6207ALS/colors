A fifth woman in the back puts on a fancy hat and coat near a pair of babies reaching out from their twin high chair."

    "description": "<p>Doris Lee\u2019s bustling scene of women preparing a Thanksgiving feast became the object of national headlines when it was first exhibited at the Art Institute in 1935 and won the prestigious Logan Purchase Prize. The themes of Thanksgiving, rural customs, and family life, which Lee painted in a deliberately folksy manner, would have had great appeal to a country still in the midst of the Depression. Yet Josephine Logan, the donor of the prize, condemned the work\u2019s broad, exaggerated style, founding the conservative \u201cSanity in Art\u201d movement in response. This controversy only brought Lee fame, and Thanksgiving has been recognized as one of the most popular nostalgic views of this American ritual since that time.</p>\n",
