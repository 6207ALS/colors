Snow was something he had treated since the 1860s, but his painting Sandvika, Norway, depicting the Norwegian village of that name near Christiania (now Oslo), was particularly meaningful. It was one of over two dozen that were begun during the artist\u2019s two-month visit to Norway in early 1895. Monet focused on six motifs there: in addition to six, nearly identical, views of Sandvika, Monet painted local wooden houses (fig. 34.1 [W1393], fig. 34.2 [W1394], and fig. 34.3 [W1404]), the Christiana fjord (fig. 34.4 [W1402]), and Mount Kolsaas (fig. 34.5 [W1415]), the last of which he painted at least a dozen times. Monet treasured the paintings that he had made during his voyage to Norway, even though none sold after they were first exhibited at Durand-Ruel in May 1895.\n\nIn 1899, however, Monet personally donated Sandvika, Norway, now in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, to the sale organized to benefit the children of Impressionist painter Alfred Sisley after his death. Aside from this painting, which was aquired by Durand-Ruel at that sale, as well as eight additional Norwegian works that the dealer purchased in 1900\u201301, Monet held on to most of the Norway paintings until his death. But despite the fact that Monet depicted Sandvika as a peaceful winter wonderland, the circumstances under which the series was painted were far from idyllic for him.\n\nThe precise reason for Monet\u2019s trip is unknown; however, it was likely instigated by a combination of factors. The general cultural climate may have played a part: Norwegian literature, theater, and music were fashionable in France in the early 1890s, perhaps piquing Monet\u2019s interest in exploring a country in which his work had been warmly received since 1883. It is also possible that Fritz Thaulow, the Norwegian painter who was an acquaintance of Monet, may have encouraged him to visit. Most compelling, perhaps, was that Monet\u2019s stepson, Jacques Hosched\u00e9, had moved to Christiania in 1894, and the family was eager for an eyewitness report. Painting was certainly also a priority, for Monet brought with him canvases from home. Sandvika, Norway bears no canvas stamp, but it has been found to have a warp-thread match with seven other Monet paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (dating from before and after his Norway trip), suggesting that the canvas on which it is painted was purchased from the Paris supplier Troisgros Fr\u00e8res (see Technical Report).\n\nMonet was not initially impressed with Norway. Getting there required a long and difficult journey via multiple trains and ferries that were delayed by the harsh winter weather; he departed Giverny on January 28 and did not arrive until February 1. Upon his arrival in Christiania, he was dismayed to find the fjords icy and covered in snow. A multiday trip by sleigh to scope out sites and motifs with his stepson changed his outlook completely. The mountains and the frozen waterfalls he saw captivated him, and within two weeks after his arrival, he was writing home about his intention to begin painting. Many of the potential sites were not accessible by train or sleigh, only on skis, however, which limited his choices.\n\nHaving selected what to paint, Monet experienced further logistical difficulties. He was frustrated over the time he had to spend traveling to and from the motifs he had selected, as well as the trouble it took to set up his painting equipment once he got there. He also had to adapt to the extreme weather in Norway, but this was an accomplishment that filled him with pride. \u201cI have bought equipment, shoes, hats, clothes, etc., and it will have to be very cold before I start to freeze,\u201d Monet wrote to his wife. \u201cBut I am coping well with it, to the considerable amazement of the people here, who are themselves rather sensitive to the cold.\u201d Having to travel by sled simply to get to the sites exposed him to the bitter winter weather. It is tempting to think that the areas found in Sandvika, Norway where soft paint appears to have been pressed by a fibrous material were the result of Monet's having to transport his canvases and extra equipment by sleigh while wearing all of his additional clothing (fig. 34.6; see Technical Report).\n\nThe ups and downs Monet experienced in Norway were typical of most of his painting expeditions from the 1880s onward: momentary frustration would lead him to question the campaign, but by the end of his trip, he would regret that he did not have more time to paint his carefully selected subjects (see, e.g., cats. 38\u201341 and cat. 45). By February 15, Monet at last revealed that his trip could be productive. As he explained to Alice, \u201cIt has been two days since I wrote to you, because although still feeling very low and on the point of taking the boat for Le Havre [to come home], I wished nonetheless to try to find myself a little corner, where I could work without having to go everywhere by sleigh or by train. And after my walk, which I still find enchanting, I believe I have finally found it. I have just settled in, three quarters of an hour away from Christiania.\u201d The \u201clittle corner\u201d he had found for himself was Sandvika, the subject of the Art Institute\u2019s painting.\n\nMonet\u2019s troubles did not end once he found his motifs. He soon discovered the complications posed by moments of intense sunshine. \u201cI am trying to summon all my courage and all my willpower so as to begin my week tomorrow morning,\u201d he wrote Alice on February 24. \u201cMy canvases are prepared, I know where I ought to be at various times of the day, weather permitting, for there are places which I have seen in cloudy weather which are impossible in sunshine, the snow is so brilliant and blinding to the eyes.\u201d Furthermore, the changing condition of the snow caused by the sun\u2019s rays was an additional source of aggravation. Writing about the marvelous sight of freshly fallen snow on fir trees, Monet expressed his frustration: \u201cI am even more furious because this will not last,\u201d he wrote to his stepdaughter on March 1. \u201cOne hour of sunshine or a little wind and it will all fall off.\u201d\n\nIn that same letter to his stepdaughter, Monet curiously described one of his chosen Norwegian motifs by referencing an even more foreign land\u2014Japan: \u201cI have begun painting a view of Sandviken which resembles a Japanese village, and I am also painting a mountain which is visible from all directions here and which makes me think of Fuji-Yama.\u201d Numerous scholars have commented upon the influence of Japanese woodblock prints on Monet\u2019s work, and Monet\u2019s comment here is often cited to support that. Joel Isaacson has noted the compositional similarities between the Sandvika series and prints by Utagawa Hiroshige such as Kanbara, Evening Snow (fig. 34.7) and The Compound of the Tenman Shrine at Kameido in the Snow (fig. 34.8). Indeed, elements of the Chicago picture bear a strong resemblance to these prints: Monet\u2019s depiction of the village is nestled between the curved frame of snow in the foreground and the rising mountain in the background; the angular roofs of the snow-topped houses\u2014made from thick strokes of stiff white paint\u2014punctuate the landscape of icy trees; and the foreshortened L\u00f6kke Bridge creates a distinct diagonal line that leads the viewer into the painting in a zigzag fashion.\n\nThe similarities between Monet\u2019s paintings and Japanese prints notwithstanding, the Sandvika pictures include many features that highlight his grounding in Western artistic practice, as noted by Paul Tucker. In particular, this is apparent in Monet\u2019s attempts to capture environmental effects by using textured surfaces and modulated color. Tucker pinpoints a difference in the treatment of mountains by the two artists: \u201c[U]nlike Mount Fuji, Monet\u2019s mountain does more than rise and fall. It expands and contracts, trembles and hovers, pushes and strains . . . the mountain refuses to be restrained by a kind of rationale or graphic clarity that characterizes Hokusai\u2019s Mount Fuji.\u201d Although Tucker\u2019s statement here is specific to Monet\u2019s paintings of Mount Kolsaas (see fig. 34.5), the observation holds true for the Art Institute\u2019s painting of Sandvika. In order to capture the \u201cvast whiteness\u201d of the environment, Monet\u2019s palette consisted of mostly lead white, which he used to subdue and vary his rather limited use of color (see Technical Report). Furthermore, texture abounds in Monet\u2019s depiction of the mountain in Sandvika: he built up the surface with thick, wavy strokes that were painted over but still remain visible; he applied short, textured strokes of low impasto; and he added final touches of more intense blues and greens to further complicate the network of brushstrokes he had already laid in (fig. 34.9). These variously applied paint layers create the shimmering and glistening effect of snow, a concern that is not shared by Japanese printmakers like Hiroshige or Hokusai when treating similar themes.\n\nThe complex textured surface of the Art Institute\u2019s Sandvika was the result of multiple work sessions, which is evident from the presence of wet-over-dry brushwork at various stages of the painting process (see Technical Report). A few of the more colorful touches, including some of the blue- and rose-toned strokes scattered throughout the landscape, were among the last additions to the picture. The application of finishing touches in the studio is in keeping with Monet\u2019s practice of the 1890s, as we now know that he spent much time on his series paintings back in his Giverny studio (e.g., Stacks of Wheat cats. 27\u201332), delaying their exhibition so he could continue perfecting their color harmonies (e.g., London [cats. 38\u201341]). This was not the case with the Norwegian pictures: Monet exhibited eight of them, including the Chicago painting, at Durand-Ruel\u2019s gallery in May 1895, shortly upon his return to France. The show, which was scheduled rather hastily, also featured works from Monet\u2019s series of paintings of Rouen Cathedral, which he had long postponed exhibiting, as well as a selection of pieces from his previous series, making it a kind of mini-retrospective. The inclusion of the Norway paintings in this show, as argued by Paul Tucker, suggests that Monet wanted to advance his reputation as a painter with an international dimension.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether Monet completed Sandvika during his trip, finished it in the month or so prior to the exhibition, or retouched it after the show but before placing it in the sale to benefit Sisley\u2019s family. Regardless of when Monet applied his final brushstrokes to Sandvika, he held to the claim he made during an interview in Norway: \u201cI am pursuing the impossible. Other painters paint a bridge, a house, a boat . . . I want to paint the air in which the bridge, the house, and the boat are to be found\u2014the beauty of the air around them, and that is nothing less than the impossible.\u201d Indeed, Monet was not especially concerned with modifying forms in this painting, for the bridge, the houses, and the other features included in the picture differ little from those seen in the related drawing (fig. 34.10 [D399]), perhaps the most elaborate of the thirty sketches he brought back in his carnet. Furthermore, technical examination of the Art Institute\u2019s canvas indicates that Monet did not make any significant compositional changes to it during the course of its execution.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Sandvika, Norway was painted on a pre-primed, no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. The work appears to retain its original stretcher. A warp-thread match was detected with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute's collection: The Petite Creuse River (1889; 1922.432 [W1231]) (cat. 25), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890/91; 1985.1103 [W1269]) (cat. 27), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (1890/91; 1933.444 [W1270]) (cat. 28), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (1890/91; 1922.431 [W1278]) (cat. 29), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (1890/91; 1983.166 [W1284]) (cat. 32), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (1897; 1933.1156 [W1475]) (cat. 36), and Water Lily Pond (1900; 1933.441 [W1628]) (cat. 37), suggesting that the fabric from these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. Charcoal was detected in one small area at the top edge of the painting; however, there was insufficient material to be able to suggest that this could relate to preparatory drawing. The painting has a textured surface with dense applications of paint used in the snow-covered areas and more open, textural brushstrokes used to build up the mountain, trees, and bridge. The presence of wet-over-dry paint applications throughout the composition indicates that the painting was carried out in more than one session. Most of the surface brushwork, on the other hand, was applied wet-in-wet. In general, the paint has a thick, viscous consistency. No changes to the composition as the painting was built up were detected.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 34.11).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 95 (lower left, in greenish-blue paint) (fig. 34.12). The signature and date were applied when the underlying paint layers were dry (fig. 34.13).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 72 \u00d7 91 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (90 \u00d7 73 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.4V (0.6) \u00d7 21.4H (0.6) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with seven other Monet paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection: The Petite Creuse River (1889; 1922.432 [W1231]) (cat. 25), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (1890/91; 1985.1103 [W1269]) (cat. 27), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (1890/91; 1933.444 [W1270]) (cat. 28), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (1890/91; 1922.431 [W1278]) (cat. 29), Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset) (1890/91; 1983.166 [W1284]) (cat. 32), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (1897; 1933.1156 [W1475]) (cat. 36), and Water Lily Pond (1900; 1933.441 [W1628]) (cat. 37).\n\nThere is moderate cusping on the left and right sides, and milder and more even cusping along the top and bottom edges.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to aqueous lining applied prior to acquisition in 1961 (see Conservation History); tacks spaced 3\u20135 cm apart. It appears that some of the original tack holes were reused when the painting was restretched after lining; not all of the edges could be fully examined, however, due to the presence of paper edge strips.\n\nOriginal stretching: The majority of the original tack holes are spaced 4\u20135 cm apart. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher may be the original stretcher. It is a keyable wooden stretcher consisting of five members, with a vertical crossbar, and mortise and tenon joints (fig. 34.14). Depth: 2 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, suggesting that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground consists of a single layer that measures 20 to 120 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 34.15).\n\nThe ground layer is off-white with some red and dark, possibly black, particles visible under magnification (fig. 34.16).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of bone black, iron oxide, alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR). One localized area of black particulate material, however, was observed microscopically near the top edge of the painting (fig. 34.17). The black particles lie directly over the ground layer and are partially covered by paint.\n\nCharcoal.\n\nInsufficient material was detected to be able to confirm whether the charcoal is part of an underdrawing campaign or whether it is an incidental accretion.\n\nThe painting was densely built up with thick, textural brushwork that often completely obscures the texture of the canvas weave (fig. 34.18, fig. 34.19). In localized areas\u2014mainly along the borders of compositional forms\u2014however, the ground layer remains visible (fig. 34.20). The painting is somewhat sketchy at the edges and the upper-left corner, where ground was also left exposed (fig. 34.21). At the upper-right corner, it appears that the artist applied some final touches of pale-pink to finish the edges (fig. 34.22). Although the thickly painted surface makes it difficult to gain a full sense of the buildup of the painting, it seems that the composition was laid in using gray and brownish tones that were thinly applied and show the texture of the canvas weave. These earliest paint layers remain visible occasionally on the surface and can be seen, for example, in the gray underlayer of the bridge (fig. 34.23). In this area, and elsewhere on the painting, it appears that the artist may have wiped the thin, fluid paint, removing it from the peaks of the canvas weave in places, before building up the painting. Bluish-gray tones were used to lay in the sky, and greenish-gray underlayers were observed in areas of foliage. For the initial painting, the artist used broader strokes and possibly also slightly wider brushes. This can be seen, for example, in the upper-right corner of the sky underneath the tree branches (fig. 34.24) and also in the undulating, zigzag strokes used near the peak of the mountain (fig. 34.25). The texture of these underlying strokes remains visible on the surface of the painting; they appear to have been dry when subsequent paint layers were applied on top, indicating that the painting was carried out in more than one session (fig. 34.26, fig. 34.27). The artist made no apparent alterations to the composition as the painting was worked up.\n\nMost of the surface brushwork was applied wet-in-wet and consists of discrete, textured strokes and low impasto. For example, the mountain, which was built up from an initial lay-in of thinly applied strokes in various tones of gray, consists of an open network of short strokes of lead white\u2013rich impasto applied wet-in-wet, with final touches of blue and green added when those thick brushstrokes were still wet (fig. 34.28). In the trees just below, similar blue and green strokes were used to delineate the branches (fig. 34.29). The heavy snow-covered areas in the foreground and on the roofs of the buildings consist of thicker, more-continuous paint layers with strokes worked wet-into-wet (fig. 34.30). The consistency of the paint seems quite viscous, almost stiff, particularly in these thickly applied areas (fig. 34.31). This is most evident in places where the paint has been drawn up by the brush in low peaks (fig. 34.32). In some of these thickly painted areas, numerous bubble holes were often observed (fig. 34.33). In several places, the surface of the painting looks like it has been pressed with a fibrous material (fig. 34.34, fig. 34.35); the resulting marks were made in the paint when it was still soft (fig. 34.36). It is difficult to say whether this was done intentionally (for example, to rough up the surface) or whether it is the result of a fabric having been pressed against the paint surface (e.g., from transporting or storing the work). It must have occurred at some point during the painting process since subsequent, higher-relief strokes adjacent to these areas were not affected (fig. 34.37).\n\nThere is a narrow band of disturbed paint along the bottom edge of the painting, caused from something having been pressed against the paint while it was still wet. The area is approximately 1.0 cm wide and 50 cm long and is located approximately 1.0 cm from the bottom edge. Such a mark could be from an easel or some kind of transport case (fig. 34.38). The affected area of paint was dry when the date was applied on top. In several places around the edges of the composition, the paint looks flattened, as if the work had been framed while the paint was still soft (fig. 34.39, fig. 34.40).\n\nTraces of a thin, dark-blue line are visible intermittently around the edges of the painting. The line appears to have been executed with paint, which was very lightly applied and deposited only on the high points of the canvas weave (fig. 34.41). It is present, at least intermittently, on all four sides. It seems to lie directly on top of the ground layer just outside the borders of the painted composition. In one place it appears to continue over an area of loss in the ground layer (fig. 34.42). It is uncertain when the line was applied and what its function was.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5 and 1.0\u20131.5 cm wide, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Many brush hairs are embedded in the paint surface.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. The presence of a pale-to-bright-pink fluorescence under ultraviolet light indicates that the artist used red lake throughout the work. Small white clusters were observed in some lead white\u2013rich areas of the painting (fig. 34.43).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 2007 and left unvarnished (see Conservation History). The painting has a soft, relatively matte surface. There are some yellowed varnish residues in the recesses of the paint texture.\n\nA 1962 examination report states that the painting was already lined with an aqueous adhesive at that point and had a yellowed varnish layer. The report also mentions the presence of \u201ctoning\u201d in areas where glue adhesive had collected on the paint surface.\n\nIn 1962, the painting was cleaned to remove yellowed varnish. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA and methacrylate L-46 was applied. The painting was reframed, and the back was sealed with Mylar.\n\nIn 2007, the AYAA/methacrylate coating and surface grime were removed. Minor inpainting was carried out at the lower right corner. The painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The canvas is lined with an aqueous adhesive and is stretched taut on the stretcher. There are some light undulations at the lower-left and lower-right corners. There is general wear and abrasion on the tacking edges, which are partially covered with paper strips. The adhesive used to attach the paper strips has contracted and pulled up the ground layer in places. The tacking edges are dirty and yellowed from the adhesive used to attach the paper edge strips. The paint layer is secure with only a few tiny, old losses down to the canvas. Cracking is minimal and, where present, is very fine. It is mainly limited to a few areas of thickly applied, lead white\u2013rich paint. There is some retouching around the edges and at a few small areas of loss within the composition. The retouching is slightly mismatched. The painting is currently unvarnished. There are a few areas of yellowed varnish residues in the recesses of the paint texture.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 2008): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, second-half-of-the-seventeenth-century, Salvator Rosa, cavetto frame with a stepped ogee sight. The frame is gilded with silver leaf over yellowish\u2013raw sienna bole on gesso. The gilding is slightly burnished and retains its original Mecca varnish finish and glue size. The back flat edge of the frame was not gilded and is painted with raw sienna. The frame is made of poplar, with applied mitered back, front, and sight moldings on a half-lapped cassetta base. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet; scotia; fillet; torus; stepped ogee; and cove (fig. 34.44).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed in 2008): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century reproduction of a seventeenth-century, Spanish, gilt, architrave frame with stylized-leaf molding and bead-and-bobbin sight molding with an independent linen-covered liner (APF Inc., New York) (fig. 34.45).   \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Donated by the artist to the Alfred Sisley Sale, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, May 1, 1899, lot 65.\n\nSold at the Alfred Sisley Sale, Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, May 1, 1899, lot 65, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, for 6,300 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Oct. 24 or Nov. 13, 1900.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland, Chicago, Feb. 13, 1901, for $3,500.\n\nBy descent from Mrs. John Jay (Harriet Blair) Borland (died 1933), Chicago, to her son, Bruce Borland.\n\nGiven by Bruce Borland, Chicago, to the Art Institute, beginning in 1961.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition de tableaux de Claude Monet, May 10\u201331, 1895, cat. 29, as Village de Sandviken (Temps de neige) or cat. 30, as Village de Sandviken.\n\nBoston, Copley Society, Loan Collection of Paintings by Claude Monet and Eleven Sculptures by Auguste Rodin, Mar. 1905, cat. 90, as Village de Sandriken [sic], Pres [sic] Christiania, 1895, lent by Mrs. John Jay Borland.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Treasures of Chicago Collectors, Apr. 15\u2013May 7, 1961, no cat. no.\n\nH\u00f8vikodden, Norway, Henie-Onstad Kunstsenter, Impresjonismen 100 \u00e5r, Nov. 1974\u2013Jan. 1975, cat. 10 (ill.).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Paintings by Monet, Mar. 15\u2013May 11, 1975, cat. 94 (ill.).

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (normal light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains lead white and viridian; blue and red pigment particles were also observed microscopically but were not detected in the area analyzed. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Sandvika\\_61\\_790\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 5, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the measured dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching of the painting after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Sandvika, Norway (W1397/1961.790),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1231, W1269, W1270, W1278, W1284, W1397, W1475, W1628,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 5, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 5, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 11, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Sandvika\\_61\\_790\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nCharcoal was identified by PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \"1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 11, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is likely that the cold, out-of-doors environment impacted the handling qualities of Monet\u2019s paints and how he manipulated them.\n\nMonet\u2019s Houses of Parliament, London (1900\u201301; 1933.1164 [W1600]) (cat. 41) displays a similar intermittent blue line around the edges of the painting. In that case, however, the line appeared to conform to the cusping of the canvas, indicating that it was applied before the painting was mounted on the stretcher, possibly as a guide to cutting or positioning the canvas on the stretcher.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 5, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1961\\_790\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Nov. 11, 2013; Kimberley Muir and Arnaud Lubin, \u201cMon\\_Sandvika\\_61\\_790\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.
