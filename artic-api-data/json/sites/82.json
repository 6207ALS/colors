    "title": "Making Place: The Architecture of David Adjaye",
    "description": "With over 50 built projects across the world, David Adjaye is rapidly emerging as a major international figure in architecture and design. Rather than advancing a signature architectural style, Adjaye\u2019s structures address local concerns and conditions through both a historical understanding of context and a global understanding of modernism. The first comprehensive museum survey devoted to Adjaye, this exhibition offers an in-depth overview of the architect\u2019s distinct approach and visual language with a dynamic installation design conceived by Adjaye Associates.",
