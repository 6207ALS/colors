    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This beautiful still life was painted by Henri Fontin-Latour in 1873. Fontin was a friend of several impressionist artists, but he chose a very different artistic path to theirs. The impressionists pursued fleeting effects of light and movement to convey a sense of the momentary, but Fontin was uncomfortable painting anything that changed more quickly than his brush could move. A strict realist, he painted only what could remain stationary, and as a result was drawn to still lifes and portraiture. Here Fontin depicts part of the dining table, its objects slightly disarranged as if just after a meal, and yet it soon becomes clear that every element of the composition was orchestrated with great care. A dark gray wall and neatly pressed white tablecloth perfectly set off the different objects. The warm glow of the fruit is juxtaposed with the cool, gleaming silver of the sugar basin and the bright touches of light on the glass objects. And in front of all these, extending up toward the arrangement on the table is a glorious mass of rhododendron flowers and leaves. They are silhouetted against a white cloth in a way that recalls the flattened decorative compositions of Japanese prints, then much collected in French artistic circles.</p>\n",
