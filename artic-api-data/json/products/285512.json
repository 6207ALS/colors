    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>The Milky Way Pod Necklace is hand carved in wax and cast in recycled sterling silver. Each piece is shaped and perfected, then plated in heavy 18K gold and finished with a high polished edge. Sarah Richardson&rsquo;s collection ranges from everyday simple to the extraordinary. An organic nature of her jewelry finds balance and symmetry through replication. Each piece is finely crafted in California, using traditional metalsmithing techniques in precious metals. </span></p><p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Size:&nbsp; 0.25 in.
