    "description": "<p>For the series \u201cRenaissance Paintings and Drawings\u201d, Sarah Charlesworth trained her attention on Western high art at a time when she was also studying psychoanalytic readings of art and literature. Here she isolated a detail from the painting \u201cThe Mystical Nativity\u201d (1500\u20131501) by Sandro Botticelli, in which an angel and a man embrace at the event of Jesus\u2019s birth. In Charlesworth\u2019s doubled separation, figures are not only removed from the original painting but also parted from each other across the two planes of a diptych. One could imagine the separation anxiety of a child weaned from his or her mother, as well as the particular future that awaits Christ, first death and then resurrection.</p>\n",
