    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: &quot;Something like a starfish and something like a woman.&quot; That was how Time Magazine's art critic described it in 1932. We're talking about the sculpture by Isamu Noguchi, hanging above you.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: The motivation for it was apparently a meeting that occurred between Noguchi and Ruth Page, at the Arts Club of Chicago in the 1930s.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute's Brandon Rude.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: Ruth Page of course was the famous modern dancer, well known for her very bold, large, expressive movements, and also the use of fabric on the stage. Supposedly Noguchi and Page were seated directly behind one another at an event, they struck up a conversation. Noguchi told her that he always wanted to portray her in one of his sculptures, and so created Miss Expanding Universe, which was the title of one of Page's dances. Ruth Page held on to this sculpture for a number of years, and eventually gave it to the museum in 1994.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Noguchi explained his feelings about this sculpture, &quot;So much modern stuff is so bitter, so hopeless, to me at least. Miss Expanding Universe is full of hope.&quot;</p>\n",
