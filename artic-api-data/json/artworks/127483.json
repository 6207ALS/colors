    "description": "<p>Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon trained as a sculptor but took up photography in 1855, and although he practiced both art forms his studio portraits of well-to-do clients soon eclipsed his sculptures in popularity. In a style of portraiture that came to be known as \u201cSalomonism,\u201d he posed his sitters next to classical columns or velvet drapery, sometimes even selecting clothing for them to wear. Many years after this photograph was made, the New York art dealer Julien Levy mounted an exhibition of portrait photography in which he contrasted con-temporary Surrealist portraits with those from the 19th century, including by Adam-Salomon.</p>\n",
