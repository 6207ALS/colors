    "copy": " Czech poet and photographer Jind\u0159ich Heisler (1914\u20131953) joined the Czech Surrealist Group in 1938, just as Nazi occupation of the country was driving the movement and Czech artists underground. Heisler published his first book of poetry a year later. In his brief and courageous career\u2014he died suddenly at the age of thirty-eight\u2014Heisler produced some of the most remarkable assemblage work of the Surrealist movement, including what is arguably the single most important photobook of the twentieth century, From the Strongholds of Sleep (1940\u201341).   This gorgeously illustrated volume\u2014with eighty color images of Heisler\u2019s assemblage pieces\u2014introduces English-speaking audiences to his work, offering in-depth analysis of his postwar years in Paris in the company of Andr\u00e9 Breton, Benjamin P\u00e9ret, the illustrator Toyen, and other major figures of the Surrealist movement.
