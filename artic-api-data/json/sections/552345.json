Mosaic glass technique, assembled from canes or strips tooled into an alternating zigzag pattern, ground, and polished. A flat vertical rim, ground and polished on a thick vessel wall, the long piriform body expands downward before bending in to a pointed base. The pattern consists of alternating canes or strips of translucent turquoise, medium-blue, and opaque white glass, medium-blue and two layers of colorless glass with gold leaf sandwiched between, then medium-blue and opaque white, medium-blue, turquoise, yellow-brown, opaque white, and yellow-brown glass. The pattern is repeated twice. For a zoomable image, see fig. 73.1.\n\nIntact, the surface is dull, pitted, and there are patches of iridescence. The ground rim may have been reground but not recently. The vessel is missing a long neck and broad horizontal disk-shaped lip that would have been cast separately in a monochrome opaque turquoise or medium-blue glass, then ground and polished.\n\nGold-band alabastra were among the complicated forms made in a variation of the mosaic glass technique in the first century B.C. The alabastron is by far the most common form of the various bottles, bowls, pyxides, and beads that were fashioned by this intriguing technique. The Art Institute\u2019s example is one of two types of gold-band alabastra known from the late Hellenistic period; some of the other shapes may be early Roman. These alabastra were studied extensively and catalogued by Andrew Oliver, Jr., in 1967. He divided the thirty known examples primarily by size; a small number of slender and larger forms were group A, and the balance, group B, were shorter and more compact. It is to this latter group that this Art Institute vessel was assigned. In the fabrication process, a series of canes or strips\u2014including one that sandwiched gold leaf between two colorless glass strips\u2014were built around a translucent blue or colorless glass body. As the body made of these strips was manipulated and tooled to form the elaborate zigzag patterns, the gold leaf shattered. A series of yellow-brown ribbons is often found within the pattern of many forms; it mimics the gold leaf layer but does not contain the precious metal. The interior glass body is not evident in this example; it may be a colorless layer that has weathered or else the vessel may have been formed entirely from a simple series of canes or strips. As with many examples, the pattern forming the vessel body seems to be a repeat of two or three strips.\n\nOn some alabastra the interior still retains a bevel-cut band to receive the separate neck and disk-shaped rim. The rim on this example is ground flat and that area cannot be discerned, but the form certainly had that type of monochrome cast neck and rim. The necks were inserted much as with modern apothecary or liquor bottles, where they are carefully ground to receive a similarly ground stopper, ensuring a tight fit. Alabastron necks were not only used to close the top of the vessel; the preserved examples have a small drilled hole to allow the precious contents to be dispensed one drop at a time. Removing the entire neck would allow the container to be easily refilled.\n\nThe fabrication technique for this group of glasses was proposed by William Gudenrath, who described the techniques for forming a cane and suggested how a gold-band ribbon might be formed along with other canes. Once arranged in parallel, they would then be picked up by a composite core coated with colorless or blue glass. The canes, laid side by side on a ceramic surface, would be heated before rolling the glass-covered core over them. Reheating this form and twisting the body with pincers in opposite directions at intervals along the profile would create the complicated gold-band decoration seen in this alabastron. The amount of reheating and manipulation required for an alabastron or other shape with as complex a design as this would have been substantial. Once the vessel was annealed and the rod removed from the core, the core material would have been removed and the interior ground. This is the technique that was used in the nineteenth century to make elaborate mosaic glass forms with ribbons and trails embedded in the surface and manipulated. It may or may not be the way ancient glassmakers fabricated their gold-band glasses.\n\nA number of examples have appeared on the market in the half-century since Oliver\u2019s lists. In 1994 Marianne Stern published a complete alabastron formerly in the Ernesto Wolf collection, Stuttgart, and referenced two more previously unknown examples. The Wolf alabastron, with its transparent, pale-yellow-green neck and rim disk, is one of the few complete examples of Oliver\u2019s type B, or the smaller form. An example of type A is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The most important recent discovery of alabastra was at a grave in the Hellenistic city of Philippi. A gold-band alabastron was found in an early-second-century-B.C. context, making it among the earliest known examples of this type. Another example and a fragment were found at the cemetery of Samothrace, dated by the excavator to the Augustan period. These excavated examples now give us a broader range for the popularity of this alabastron.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The Chicago example was published in Luckner, \u201cAncient Glass,\u201d p. 83, no. 62 (illus.).\n\nSee Oliver, \u201cLate Hellenistic Glass,\u201d pp. 20\u201323, figs. 12\u201313; Oliver, \u201cAdditions and Corrections,\u201d p. 17, where he added five more alabastra to his previous list.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s piece was apparently unknown to Oliver, as it was probably in storage until recently.\n\nGudenrath, \u201cTechniques of Glassmaking and Decoration,\u201d pp. 217\u201318.\n\nStern and Schlick-Nolte, Early Glass of the Ancient World, pp. 302\u201305, no. 88.\n\n1st century B.C., acc. no. 17.194.284; Oliver\u2019s type A, the more elegant alabastron, with a longer and more slender body, is represented by a striking example, also 1st century B.C. and in the Met\u2019s collection (acc. no. 17.194.286a, b), that still retains its cast neck and lip.\n\nPatera and Nikolaidou-Patera, \u201cHellenistic Tomb,\u201d pp. 89\u201390, figs. 3, 5\u20136.\n\nDusenbery, \u201cAncient Glass,\u201d pp. 38\u201339, no. 8, fig. 9.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 73 Alabastron (Container for Scented Oil), early 2nd/1st century B.C.\n\nfig. 73.1 Alabastron (Container for Scented Oil) (early 2nd/1st century B.C.).
