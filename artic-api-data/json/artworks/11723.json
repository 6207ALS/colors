    "description": "<p>Consistent with the Impressionist aesthetic that Berthe Morisot fervently espoused, <em>Woman at Her Toilette</em> attempts to capture the essence of modern life in summary, understated terms. The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, \u00c9douard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and \ufb02ower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery re\ufb02ection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eug\u00e8ne the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot\u2019s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>\n",
