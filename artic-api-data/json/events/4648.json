    "description": "<p>Not all works featured in the museum were originally conceived as art. For example, you probably wouldn\u2019t expect to see a work entitled \u201cPigsty and Latrines\u201d in the Chinese art galleries at the Art Institute. Join Rhoades Curatorial Fellow Zhiyan Yang to find out why such a work was made in the first place. What can objects like this tell us about the everyday life of premodern China? What does it mean and what function did it serve?</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the image on this page is for reference purposes only and may not be featured during the gallery talk.</p>",
