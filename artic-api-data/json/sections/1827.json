In 1722 Boudinot was apprenticed to Huguenot silversmith Simeon Soumaine while maintaining close ties to another Huguenot silversmith, Peter Vergereau, who married Boudinot\u2019s elder sister, Susannah. After completing his apprenticeship in 1729, Boudinot moved to Antigua, where he managed family business interests. In 1734 Boudinot relocated to Philadelphia, establishing himself as a silversmith. His first shop was located next door to Benjamin Franklin\u2019s printing shop and post office on Market Street; he subsequently moved to Second Street. Franklin may have been responsible for Boudinot\u2019s appointment in 1752\u201353 as postmaster in Princeton, New Jersey, where Boudinot also established himself as a merchant and tavern keeper but continued to work as a silversmith. His most productive years as a craftsman were the 1740s and early 1750s, when he made silver for prominent Philadelphia patrons, including tankards for Franklin and his wife, Deborah, and George and Anna (Clarke) O\u2019Kill. He fashioned a teapot for jurist and landowner John Stockton and his wife, Abigail, of Princeton, whose son Richard married Boudinot\u2019s daughter Annis in 1758. Suffering from ill health, Boudinot left Princeton by May 1762 and then lived in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, with his son, lawyer Elias Boudinot, who later served as one of New Jersey\u2019s delegates to the Second Continental Congress. In a letter of December 11, 1762, to the younger Boudinot, Franklin writes, \u201cI hope your good father\u2019s indisposition will be of no long continuance.\u201d In Elizabethtown Boudinot continued working as a silversmith, fabricating a few objects that can be documented to the years prior to his death, including a mug for his granddaughter Suzanne made about 1765.\n\nBoudinot\u2019s salver bears close resemblance to London models from the second quarter of the eighteenth century featuring S- (or cyma-) curve borders with shells and scrolled feet with acanthus leaves. Its original owners were Henry Harrison (1714\u20131766) and his wife, Mary Aspden (1719\u20131803), of Philadelphia, who married in 1748. The Harrisons presumably acquired the item while Boudinot resided in the city; their house on Coombs Alley (now Cuthbert Street) was located two blocks north of Boudinot\u2019s Second Street shop. Harrison was a wealthy dry-goods merchant and served as mayor of Philadelphia in 1762\u201363; his estate was estimated to be worth \u00a315,086.12.0, including 157 troy ounces of plate valued at \u00a378. 10.o (0ver $2 million in today\u2019s terms). The salver apparently descended to the Harrisons\u2019 son George (1762\u20131845), who in 1792 married Sophia Francis (1769\u20131851); their initials form the monogram GSH, engraved on the front. In addition, a second salver marked by Boudinot, identical to the Art Institute\u2019s in dimensions, weight, and cast elements, was made for the Philadelphia merchant John Wallace and his wife, Mary Maddox, who married in 1750 (see fig. 26.1).  \nDavid L.

Naeve, August 11, 1978, curatorial files, Department of American Art, Art Institute of Chicago. Williams\u2019s conclusion is borne out by the sets of initials subsequently engraved on the salver.\n\n\u201cInventory of the Estate of Henry Harrison decd,\u201d February 6, 1773, Philadelphia Probate Records, Philadelphia City Archives, City Hall, Philadelphia.
