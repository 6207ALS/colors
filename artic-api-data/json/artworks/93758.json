It depicts a sleeping shepherd visited by fairies \u201cWho, in their dancing, him so charm\u2019d, / that though he wakt he slept.\u201d Fuseli had painted the subject in the 1780s, and Georgina North appears to have created her work in his painting\u2019s spirit.<br>Lady North, who studied with Fuseli, was the daughter of the Countess of Guildford, one of the artist\u2019s most important patrons. Her drawings and paintings bear the strong influence of her teacher, though they are simultaneously less accomplished and more eccentric.</p>\n",
