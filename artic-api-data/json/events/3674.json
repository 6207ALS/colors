    "description": "<p>><strong>This event is SOLD OUT, a standby line will start at 7:00pm for tickets that become available.</strong></p><p>><br>Experience a rare multimedia performance by Wolfgang Voigt, one of the most influential figures in contemporary electronic music, as he brings his project Gas to the museum. Drawing on Romantic landscape and classical music as much as ambient minimalism and techno, Voigt creates an uplifting and enveloping evocation of the wonder of the natural world. Don\u2019t miss this captivating kaleidoscope of swirling sounds and textures. </p><p>><em>Presented with the Empty Bottle </em></p><p>><em>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman\u2019s Board of the Art Institute of Chicago. </em></p><p> class=\"standard-sand\"><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p>>Based in Cologne, Germany, <strong>Wolfgang Voigt</strong> has had a prodigious output under various aliases on many record labels, including Warp, Harvest, Raster-Noton and Force Inc, and the label he co-founded - Kompakt. The four Gas albums, originally released between 1996 and 2000, were reissued in 2008 to enormous international acclaim, and they have been widely recognised as the most important ambient music creations of the 1990s.</p>",
