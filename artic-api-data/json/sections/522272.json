The first coins issued for Marcus Aurelius came out in A.D. 139, when he was made consul designate and was recognized as Caesar, shortly after his adoption by Antoninus Pius, an adoption that had been arranged by then-emperor Hadrian. The obverse of this coin trumpets that new familial link, declaring the young prince to be PII FIL[ius], \u201cson of (Antoninus) Pius.\u201d From the beginning of his reign in 138, Antoninus Pius took Marcus Aurelius as a subordinate colleague on the throne, setting a precedent for future joint rules.\n\nThe young man who would one day write the Meditations was already known for his pacific nature and Stoic education. Therefore the type on the reverse of this coin seems a curious choice. The reverse image presents Roma-Virtus holding Victory and a parazonium, a long dagger used iconographically as a sign of military courage. The assimilation of Roma and Virtus is seen on Roman coins after the reign of Nero (d. A.D. 68); this assimilation may seem counterintuitive, since Virtus represents manly courage and comes from the word vir (man). However, there was a long tradition of personifying virtues as female, partly since the grammatical gender of the words was usually feminine. Virtus is usually depicted as a maiden in a crested helmet and short tunic and carrying a parazonium, while Roma frequently carries a Victory, as this figure does. While such an image may seem inappropriate for a coin of the young philosopher prince, it was, as it turns out, prescient. As emperor, Marcus Aurelius would spend two decades leading his legions in desperate attempts to secure the northern frontiers, where he would die on campaign in 180.\n\nThe reverse inscription identifies M. Aurelius\u2019s tribunates and consular years, allowing a firm dating of the coin.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Gergel, \u201cAgora S166 and Related Works,\u201d esp. pp. 386\u201391.
