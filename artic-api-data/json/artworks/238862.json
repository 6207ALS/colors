    "description": "<p>During the summer of 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. conducted a housing desegregation campaign in Chicago that culminated in August with marches on the South Side. White workers, homeowners, and young residents protested violently, resisting integration. Eventually the American Nazi Party became involved, organizing a series of smaller protests and then a demonstration called the White People\u2019s March, held September 10, 1966. South Side\u2013based photojournalist <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/115333/darryl-cowherd\">Darryl Cowherd</a> was one of several local Black photographers who captured the event. Among the marchers was a high-school classmate of Cowherd\u2019s who facilitated the photographer\u2019s access at what must have been uncomfortably close range.</p>\n",
