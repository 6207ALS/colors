    "description": "<p>Albert Bierstadt is best remembered for his paintings of the American West, but during his early career, the ambitious artist also created New England landscapes, particularly of the White Mountains, as seen here. When this painting was first exhibited in 1863, critics declared it Bierstadt\u2019s \u201cbest work\u201d and praised the artist\u2019s deft contrast of \u201clight and shade,\u201d which brought a heightened realism to the image. Bierstadt\u2019s affinity for the White Mountains mirrored a growing interest in the region as one of America\u2019s premier tourist attractions. Photographs of the area from the 19th century suggest that Bierstadt utilized landscape elements from the Flume, a popular New Hampshire tourist site, in this imaginary composition.</p>\n",
