    "description": "<p>Lesley Dill, whose father was a beloved teacher despite suffering from schizophrenia, and whose mother was a speech and theater instructor, grew up hyper aware of the importance of language. Not surprisingly, she was an English major in college, and it was during that period that her mother gave her the collected works of Emily Dickinson\u2014which proved to be perhaps Dill\u2019s most significant influence. Almost all of Dill\u2019s works contain words, and frequently they are those of Dickinson. Dill has said, \u201cI think of words, and especially the poems of Emily Dickinson, for their embodiment of psychological states of despair and euphoria as metaphors for being, as a kind of spiritual armor, and intervening skin between ourselves and the world.\u201d <em>A Word Made Flesh</em>, a series of four mixed-process prints literally transcribes the words of Dickinson onto a woman\u2019s body. While the text is legible in <em>Back</em> and <em>Throat</em>, Dill has manipulated the language within the ghostly composition of <em>Front</em> to the point where only select phrases are visible: \u201cghastly\u201d over the woman\u2019s chest and \u201ccares\u201d (short for caress) over her stomach for example. In this series, word and image merge with forceful, yet disturbingly vulnerable, effect.</p>\n",
