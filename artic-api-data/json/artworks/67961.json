This now\u2013iconic photograph was originally included in a photo\u2013essay, \u201cTwo American Families,\u201d published in the London Sunday Times Magazine. In a letter to her editor, Arbus described encountering the woman pictured here in a bookstore: \u201cI said I wanted to photograph her with husband and children so she suggested I wait till warm weather so I can do it around the pool! . . . They are a fascinating family. I think all families are creepy in a way.\u201d Part of the caption for the image, based on Arbus\u2019s corresponence, reads, \u201cThe parents seem to be dreaming the child and the child seems to be inventing them.</p>\n",
