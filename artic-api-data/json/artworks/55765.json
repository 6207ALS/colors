It is the first element in a collected volume of late editions of several texts by the master (<em>On Human Proportion</em>, 1532\u201338, <em>On Fortifications</em>, 1527, and <em>The Painter\u2019s Manual</em>, 1538). This second state of the woodcut is the only one to include an ad monogram. D\u00fcrer\u2019s fame was already such that his eminently recognizable nested initials had become an ornamental motif in their own right. Annotations on the print\u2019s verso date it to August 14, 1606, about when the sheet was reprinted and probably when it was purchased.</p>\n",
