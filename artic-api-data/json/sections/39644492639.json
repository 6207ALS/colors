Complex both in making and meaning, this work borrows figures from various traditions and combines them in surprising configurations. The result is a work that denies any single interpretation.\n\nOn Hiva Oa, Gauguin focused on writing and drawing. This was in part practical; his health was poor, and he was nursing a broken leg. Unable to meet the physical demands of painting, he exerted himself intellectually. Upon his arrival, he set about gaining favor with the Catholic bishop and successfully secured a strip of land between the Roman Catholic mission and the Protestant church on which to build a studio. He presented himself to his neighbors as a devout Catholic, attending mass regularly, but at the same time he was also applying final touches to L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme (Catholicism and the Modern Mind), a manuscript, started in Tahiti in 1897 and completed in 1902, in which he critiqued the church and, more particularly, found fault with the institution of marriage (see fig. 126.2). Inevitably, as Gauguin\u2019s conduct in his personal life also revealed his disregard for Christian morality, relations with his neighbors soured.\n\nGauguin approached this transfer drawing with typical irreverence, subverting conventional Christian representations of angels by giving this angel the body of the Buddha, as seen in one of the artist\u2019s treasured photographs of relief sculptures at the temple of Borobudur (fig. 126.3). For years the artist borrowed motifs from his extensive collection of reproductions and combined them with spiritual themes and forms encountered on his travels, a practice that reflects his belief in the universality of religion. In a related but earlier manuscript (1897\u201398), L\u2019\u00e9glise catholique et les temps modernes (The Catholic Church and Modern Times), he argued that all humanity was subject to the fundamental mysteries of the universe, which\u2014happily, in his opinion\u2014no one belief system can explain. He posited that all religions are inherently equal and grounded in universal principles: \u201cOur souls today, gradually shaped and taught by other souls that have come before, no longer want a God-creator who is tangible . . . the unfathomable mystery remains. . . . God does not belong to the scientist, nor to the logician; he belongs to the poets, to the realm of dreams; he is the symbol of Beauty, Beauty itself.\u201d At certain points in his writing, he placed particular emphasis on aspects of Buddhist beliefs. For example, in L\u2019esprit moderne the artist stated that, while Christ viewed the present life as a transition to heaven, Buddha considered it integral to achieving the perfect state of nirvana. In his 1899 oil painting, The Great Buddha (fig. 126.4 [W 579]), Gauguin explored the unity of world religions. He amalgamated Buddhist, Polynesian, and Christian themes in the painting by embellishing the base of a large seated figure with scenes of Tahitian spirits and gods and setting this complex idol before a depiction of the Last Supper in the far left background. Two figures not unlike those in the Art Institute\u2019s Angel, Peacock, and Three Tahitians appear in the painting\u2019s middle ground. This raises the possibility that the transfer drawing borrows certain meanings from the painting, even though it also invites interpretations of its own.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s composition includes an angel, dressed in a loincloth, who stands in radiant light (diagonal lines, reinforced in both brown and black, indicate its celestial source). With his large wings, this figure is perhaps the high-ranking Gabriel or Michael, archangels whom Gauguin might have invoked to introduce associations of annunciation or judgment into the image. At the angel\u2019s feet is a peacock. The angel and bird are separated from the three workers by a tree and stand on slightly higher ground. However, as if to challenge any positive identification, the angel is depicted on the same scale as the three Tahitians. While the tree in the middle of the composition can be seen as separating a celestial realm from a terrestrial one, the landscape in which the scene is set is continuous. That the angel and peacock both face toward the Tahitians shifts the focus of the drawing toward the humans and their earthly pursuit: gathering fruit from the fertile land.\n\nThough the angel can be seen to inhabit the same earthly paradise as the three women, they pay him no attention. Their lack of awareness might indicate that they are oblivious to the angel because his presence is unexceptional. The meaning of the peacock is elusive. Among Christians, the peacock traditionally has symbolized regeneration and immortality; thus here the bird could refer to Christ\u2019s resurrection and signal hope for the trio of women. Gauguin often associated death with physical and spiritual regeneration. Writing to \u00c9mile Bernard after the death of Vincent van Gogh, he stated, \u201cTo die at this time is a great happiness for him, it is precisely the end of his suffering, and if he returns in another life, he will bring with him the fruit of his fine conduct in this world (according to the law of the Buddha).\u201d The possibility nevertheless exists that the bird\u2019s function in the transfer drawing is purely decorative.\n\nTwo trees, heavily outlined in both transferred black and brown ink, frame the scene and further unite the group within it. The transfer drawing seems to present the Polynesian terrain in a paradisiac light, thus suggesting that there is such a thing as heaven on earth. The idea that the Society Islands were an idyll far removed from the realities of the modern world was standard in colonial travel writing in the late nineteenth century. Tahitians, said guidebooks to Oceania, lived in a utopia untouched by the corruptive forces of modern western civilization. This misconception was perpetuated in Pierre Loti\u2019s popular novel Le mariage de Loti (1878), which Gauguin read. Although Gauguin knew very well that Tahiti had been a protectorate of France since 1842 and a colony since 1880, he was dismayed to discover upon his arrival in that the island was much less of an isolated paradise than he had hoped. Nonetheless, in his artwork he continued to play into the notion of a Tahitian paradise for a European audience.\n\nGauguin used the arrangement of the Art Institute\u2019s transfer drawing, nearly identical in scale, in his painting Group with Angel of around the same time (fig. 126.5 [W 622]). The two are close in scale. Whether Angel, Peacock, and Three Tahitians is a study for the painting or a drawing made after its creation cannot be determined. Angel, Peacock, and Three Tahitians may have had personal significance for the artist: he traced and transferred the figures in the work directly in two ink drawings made for his 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After) (fig. 126.6 and fig. 126.7). Separated by only a page, they follow a passage that addresses the myth of Tahiti and Gauguin\u2019s own susceptibility to the self-mythologizing process:\n\nYou wish to know who I am; my works are not enough for you. Even at this moment, as I write, I am revealing only what I want to reveal. . . . It is the inner man you want to see. . . . Besides I do not always see myself very well. . . . I am speaking to you of many things, in spite of my promise to talk about the Marquesas. It is rather treacherous for me to lure you on in hope that you are going to get something quite different from what you get in Paris. But you must forgive me; I myself was taken in. Here I am, let us swallow the pill. My brush must make up for it. There are indeed some superb mountains that I could describe to you, more or less untruthfully, but I should have to have the talent for description as well as innumerable adjectives which I do not know but which are so familiar to Pierre Loti.\n\nEvidently, Gauguin was aware of the power of his drawings\u2014or his \u201cbrush\u201d\u2014to convey his own story of the islands, one pieced together from various sources as well as experience, and understood that his art would in turn inform viewers\u2019 sense of his persona. If the Art Institute\u2019s drawing hints at the \u201cunfathomable mysteries\u201d of faith, it also alludes to those of the myth-making artist and his work.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Emily Crane Chadbourne (1871\u20131964), Chicago and London, by 1910.\n\nGiven by Emily Crane Chadbourne to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1926.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, no cat. no.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 872.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., A Loan Exhibition of Paul Gauguin, for the Benefit of the New York Infirmary, Apr. 3\u2013May 4, 1946, cat. 61.\n\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Gauguin in Tahiti, Apr. 1\u2013May 14, 1950, no cat.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., Gauguin: Loan Exhibition for the Benefit of the Citizens\u2019 Committee for Children of New York City, Inc., Apr. 5\u2013May 5, 1956, cat. 74.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture, Feb. 12\u2013Mar. 29, 1959, cat. 192; New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Apr. 21\u2013May 31, 1959.\n\nMunich, Haus der Kunst, Paul Gauguin, Apr. 1\u2013May 29, 1960, p. 24, cat. 136, pl. 66; Vienna, \u00d6sterreichische Galerie im Oberen Belvedere, June 7\u2013July 31, 1960, cat. 59, pl. 26.\n\nMunich, Haus der Kunst, World Cultures and Modern Art, June 16\u2013Sept. 30, 1972, cat. 1764.\n\nPhiladelphia Museum of Art, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, Mar. 23\u2013May 13, 1973, cat. 103.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Rose Mary Fischkin, \u201cNotes on Some Modern Drawings,\u201d Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 21, no. 3 (Mar. 1927), p. 34 (ill.).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, ed.

Elizabeth C. Childs suggested that Gauguin\u2019s passion for writing was equal to his desire to paint; just as he moved his own work from Tahiti to the Marquesas, he took with him the 1897\u201398 manuscript in order to edit and elaborate on these concepts in a more polished, final format, which became the 1902 text.

Belinda Thomson, exh. cat. (Tate Publishing, 2010), pp. 133\u201349.\n\nThis is not the first instance in which Gauguin placed an angel in a Polynesian setting; in the 1891 painting Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary) (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W 428]), a large-winged angel joins two women who stand reverently before a Tahitian woman carrying a child on her shoulder, which suggests that the latter are Mary and the infant Jesus. Angels also appear in the 1888 painting The Vision after the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling the Angel) (1888 [W 245, W 2002 308]) and the 1892 drawing Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (see cat. 72, fig. 4).

Robins mentions that six (five works on paper [one is a drawing on the verso and counted as the sixth]; see cat. 45, cat. 61, cat. 64, and cat. 129) works by Chadbourne were given to the Art Institute, and these works were certainly in the Grafton Galleries show by deduction: \u201cIn 1913 she lent four of these six works by Gauguin to the Armory Show, which suggests that all the Chadbourne Gauguins now in Chicago were in the Grafton Galleries exhibition.\u201d Anna Gruetzner Robins, \u201c\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d Burlington Magazine 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), p. 788.\n\nAccording to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts there was no exhibition catalogue for this exhibition, but they provided the correspondence from The Art Institute of Chicago to their institution that outlined the objects loaned.
