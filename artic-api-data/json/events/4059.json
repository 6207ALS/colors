    "description": "<p>Beginning at the Hyde Park Art Center in the late 1960s, a self-organized group of artists made up of Jim Falconer, Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Suellen Rocca, and Karl Wirsum presented six exhibitions across the country in just four short years. The Hairy Who\u2019s inventive and outrageous artwork and comic book publications transformed the landscape of art in Chicago and beyond. </p><p>Exhibition co-organizer and researcher Thea Liberty Nichols uncovers the behind-the-scenes provenance research that led to groundbreaking discoveries unique to <em>Hairy Who? 1966-1969</em>. </p><p>After the lecture and lunch, you have several options to fill out your day. You may choose to take guided afternoon gallery tours: \u201cFrom Harry Who to Hairy Who?\u201d led by Annie Morse; and/or \u201cMaking Art Now!
