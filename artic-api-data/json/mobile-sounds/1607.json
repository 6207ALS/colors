    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In 1877 Monet rented an apartment near the Gare Saint-Lazare, one of the great nineteenth century Paris train stations. Exhilarated by the station\u2019s modern glass and iron architecture and its atmosphere of activity and constant change he began work on a group of paintings there. Monet called this version \u201cArrival of the Normandy Train,\u201d underling his aim to represent a sense of movement in his painting. We see the great black locomotive pulling into the station. Clouds of steam issue from its funnel as it grinds to a halt against the buffers. The steam, conjured up with quick, curving dashes of paint seems heavy and gray beneath the station\u2019s canopy, but turns white as it escapes and catches the daylight outside. A mass of people greets the train. They are described simply by strokes of dark paint, whose indistinctness gives the crowd a sense of jostling movement. For Monet, the Gare Saint-Lazare had particular significance. Down the railway line at Argenteuil lay his family\u2019s riverside home. The Gare Sainte-Lazare marked the point where Monet entered the very different world of the city, full of urban stimulation where his clients and dealers could be found.</p>\n",
