Occasionally depicted in portraits of wealthy infants, these rattles and teething devices were imported as well as made in the American colonies, and their presence is also attested to in newspaper advertisements, silversmiths\u2019 account books, and other documents. As much as any other item, these toys of precious metal and imported coral reflect a degree of income inequality in the eighteenth century that we have come to associate more closely with the Gilded Age or the present.\n\nSince 1942 the initials IF inscribed on one end of this object under the whistle, along with the Fayerweather crest engraved on its side, have been interpreted to mean that it was made for Jonathan Fayerweather (1722\u20131755), the son of Thomas and Hannah Waldo Fayerweather of Boston. Little is known about Jonathan, who died childless. It has been suggested that grandmothers often gave such objects to their grandchildren; in this case, Jonathan\u2019s fraternal grandmother predeceased him, but his maternal grandmother, Hannah Mason Waldo, was still living at the time of his birth. The noted silver scholar and jewelry historian Martha Gandy Fales observed that Alexander Pope referred to such a gift in \u201cThe Rape of the Lock\u201d (1714):\n\nHer infant grand-dame\u2019s whistle next it grew,  \nThe bells she jingled, and the whistle blew.\n\nIf made at the time of Jonathan\u2019s birth in 1722 or a year or so thereafter, this would be the earliest surviving New England example of the toy, although one is recorded as being sold by Jeremiah Dummer (see cat. 4 and cat. 5) to Samuel Sewall in May 1710. It would also be among the earliest objects known to survive bearing the mark of Thomas Edwards, whose apprenticeship was completed at about the same time that Jonathan was born. The item may have been imported, with Edwards adding his own TE mark to it. Other sources have dated the whistle and bells to around 1730, suggesting that it was possibly intended for another member of the Fayerweather family, since these objects were designed for children younger than eight.\n\nThese rattles were not only ostentatious emblems of wealth, but they were also functional. The bells provided distracting noise, as did the whistle, and the stick of polished coral offered a good surface for teething. The chain, probably original in this case, could be looped around the child\u2019s wrist or attached to his or her clothing. This example, like some of the other surviving ones, has seen some serious use. Two of its six brackets are missing, and the coral piece has been broken or abraded. The eye-catching red coral, also employed in various forms of jewelry, was obtained from the Mediterranean; it was exported from Italy to England and, in turn, to colonial America. Coral was long believed to have preventative and curative powers, and thus these objects (in theory) protected the child from illness and the evil eye as well as supplying amusement. The bells are also thought to have had the ability to ward off evil. Infant mortality often coincided with the period of teething; the purity of silver and the power of coral would, parents hoped, help children through this difficult time.\n\nThomas Edwards was a prominent member of the Edwards family of Boston goldsmiths. Trained by his father, John, he joined his brother Samuel in the craft and was followed by his nephew Joseph. He had numerous connections in New York, where such objects were more popular than in Boston. He employed John Le Roux of that city as a journeyman in the 1720s, and he seems to have spent most of the 1730s and early 1740s there. Edwards subsequently returned to Boston and had a highly successful career, leaving his mark as one of the most prominent silversmiths of his generation and amassing a considerable estate that placed him in the top 10 percent of Boston\u2019s citizenry. He apparently died quite suddenly, in his early to mid-fifties; his nephew recorded on September 14, 1755, that \u201cmy Uncle Tho<sup>s</sup> Edwards . . . was this morning to all appearances in good Health &amp; before noon was a pale &amp; Lifeless Corpse.\u201d As Edwards\u2019s career was still in full flood at the time of his death, his estate papers provide a useful snapshot of a successful silversmith\u2019s operation in the 1750s. His inventory is notable for the large amount of silver in the shop. Edwards had on hand more than 532 ounces of wrought silver, indicating an abundance of stock available for purchase, as well as substantial quantities of buckles, buttons, earrings, and other small items. He also had an additional 365 ounces of \u201cunwrought silver &amp; Household plate\u201d and 11 ounces of \u201cWrought &amp; unwrought Gold.\u201d  \nGerald W. R.
