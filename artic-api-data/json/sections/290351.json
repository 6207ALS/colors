As suggested by T. R. Way\u2019s misdating of the group in his 1905 catalogue, all of these drawings seem to have been made without the Ways\u2019 knowledge; in all likelihood, this was because Whistler intended them to be printed in Paris as part of his experimentation with color lithography. However, the artist seems to have abandoned the drawings until 1895, when he gave them to the Way firm for transferring and printing. This image and two others in the group (cat. 53 and cat. 54) were drawn on a thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal provided by the French printer Belfond. Their years in storage, coupled with the Ways\u2019 lack of experience with the French transfer paper, were probably responsible for the imperfect transferring of the drawings to stone and the spotty appearance of the resulting impressions. T. R. Way, who described the three mother-and-child images on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal as \u201cwholly or partially failures,\u201d attributed the problems to Whistler\u2019s insistence on \u201churrying matters unduly\u201d by putting the transferred images through the etching process \u201cbefore they were strong enough to bear it\u201d (1905). The most uneven of the three lithographs, Mother and Child, No. 3, was probably the first of the drawings on the French paper to be transferred to stone, and for this reason precedes Mother and Child, No. 2 (cat. 53) in this catalogue, despite their titles. An impression of Mother and Child, No. 3, once in the possession of Howard Mansfield and now in the Mansfield-Whittemore-Crown Collection, Chicago, is inscribed 1st set on French paper.\n\nThis image is closely related to two drawings on transfer paper that must have been made at the same time but which were left untransferred in the artist\u2019s estate. Mother and Child Asleep on a Sofa (dwg. V) and Mother and Child Reclining (dwg. VI) were drawn on thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal bearing Belfond\u2019s blind stamp. Whistler went over the versos of both drawings with purple ink, probably after deciding not to give them to Belfond for transferring in 1891/92. Several pastels of the same models also appear to have been executed at the same time; the model\u2019s pose in Sleeping (M 1293r) and Mother and Child: The Pearl (M 1290), both in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., approximates that seen in Mother and Child, No. 3, and Whistler characteristically made variations on standard poses in different media. Given his demonstrated interest in exploring the mother-and-child theme in other color media, it seems likely that Whistler originally created these transfer drawings with color lithography in mind, perhaps for use as keystones.\n\nChicago: AIC , cream Japanese paper (222 \u00d7 288 mm); mwc, cream Japanese paper (222 \u00d7 288 mm), signed, and inscribed, possibly in T.
