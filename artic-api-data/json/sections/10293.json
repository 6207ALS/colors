By 1906, however, it was given over entirely to metalwork. In 1902, at the suggestion of Mary C. (Ware) Dennett, one of its founders, the designer and silversmith Mary Catherine Knight was appointed the shop\u2019s manager. Prior to moving to Boston, Dennett had established the design program at Drexel Institute in Philadelphia, where she taught gilded leatherworking and where Knight had been one of her students. In addition to her work with Dennett, Knight studied at the Rhode Island School of Design and had been employed for a short time as a designer by Gorham Manufacturing Company in Providence.\n\nOnce Knight assumed her position at the Handicraft Shop, her responsibilities were to design, fabricate, and decorate vessels. Apparently, she also unofficially served as an active and articulate ombudsman on behalf of metalworkers in their relations with the Society of Arts and Crafts and the Handicraft Shop. In this, she was likely influenced by Dennett\u2019s example, as the latter had been an effective spokesperson for society members.\n\nAs reflected in the Art Institute\u2019s sauce or mayonnaise set, Knight\u2019s work in metal makes clear the influence of her studies with Dennett. The individual objects are simple in form and reflect the local preference for the colonial style, but their decoration is detailed, consisting of delicate bands of compound floral and foliate motifs created with punches, a technique used in the production of gilded leather items. Knight employed a simple round punch to fashion two of her favored motifs, stylized clusters of grapes and six-petal flowers. In some cases the decoration consists exclusively of punched designs, but in other instances, the designs are pierced. Knight is best known, however, for her punched designs that are filled with enamels, generally in a palette of blue, turquoise, and, from time to time, white.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s set is from a group of enameled wares Knight produced between 1902 and 1908. The designs of the individual objects are typical of her silver in their evocation of colonial shapes; the punched and enameled ornaments also reference colonial examples. Engraved floral and foliate motifs contained within horizontal hexagonal reserves bracketed by stylized six-petal flowers appear at the rim of the dish and bowl. Similarly engraved hexagonal reserves are found on beakers by seventeenth-century American silversmiths of Dutch as well as English descent. In particular, the resemblance between Knight\u2019s straplike hexagonal reserves and those found on a beaker that, in Knight\u2019s time, was attributed to Jacob Hull, a seventeenth-century Boston silversmith (although now given to Hull and Sanderson of Boston), has been observed. Comparable reserves are encountered more frequently on seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century New York silver, although the engraving also references the Aesthetic Movement in the stylized flowering branches that thread through the reserves.\n\nWhile she conceived and executed many items entirely on her own, Knight also designed a number of works that were fabricated by others at the Handicraft Shop. This cooperative working method mirrored that promulgated by British designer Charles Robert Ashbee at his crafts community, the Guild of Handicraft, first in London and subsequently in the Cotswolds. At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Knight jointly exhibited two objects as designer with Handicraft Shop metalsmiths Seth Ek and Karl F. Leinonen. In 1905, under the organization\u2019s aegis, Knight, together with Leinonen and Frans J. R. Gyllenberg, entered jointly credited works in that year\u2019s annual exhibition at the Art Institute. In addition to Boston, Saint Louis, and Chicago, Knight exhibited work in Cleveland and Detroit. Although she remained a member of the Society of Arts and Crafts until at least 1927, little is known about her work after about 1911.  \nBarbara K.

Collaborations such as Knight\u2019s were encouraged by the Society of Arts and Crafts.\n\nOne of the principles of the Society of Arts and Crafts states: \u201cWhen the designer and workman are not united in the same person, they should work together, each teaching the other his own special knowledge, so that the faculties of the designer and the workman may tend to become united in each.\u201d Society for Arts and Crafts (1907), n.p.

Leinonen, supervisor of the silversmiths at the Handicraft Shop, emigrated from Finland in 1893 after a ten-year apprenticeship; Ek (active between 1906 and 1912) was also Finnish. In magnitude, the influx of Scandinavian metalsmiths into Boston parallels their immigration to Chicago, where they were employed in large numbers, many initially at Kalo (cat. 81 and cat. 82).\n\nGyllenberg trained in Sweden. Among the Handicraft Shop\u2019s entries in the exhibition are the following: Gyllenberg, Frans, maker, Knight, Mary C., designer; and Leinonen, Karl, maker, Knight, Mary C., designer.
