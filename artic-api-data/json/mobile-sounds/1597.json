    "transcript": "<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: &quot;Time Transfixed\u201d is one of Belgian surrealist artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte\u2019s great masterpieces, a startling image of a train belching smoke emerging from a fireplace.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Art Institute director Douglas Druick.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This picture exemplifies Magritte\u2019s surrealism, the desire to bring together an impossible conjunction of conscious and unconscious images. The title \u201cTime Transfixed\u201d suggests that everything has come to a halt. The world has stood still. We are looking at time, which has been frozen. What makes this picture so memorable is that it\u2019s so utterly unexpected. And that was the kind of visual magic that Magritte could create by juxtaposing elements that are normally not juxtaposed in human experience.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The train with its connotations of dirty smoke, billowing steam and noise is all the more startling for its appearance in such an orderly bourgeois interior. And yet it has a connection with reality in its coal-fired engine and smoky funnel, which recalled the coal-fired stoves installed in fire places. Magritte made the painting for the London house of a wealthy English patron, Edward James. It was one of three paintings intended to decorate the home\u2019s ballroom though the collector chose another location for the work once it was completed.</p>\n",
