Three years later, there were nine hundred residents.\n\nConditions were harsh and demanding, yet the colony grew and prospered. Many members later recalled those years as the best, most exciting times of their lives. Freedom from capitalism, a varied social, intellectual and recreational life, and mass participation in the democratic process of the community gave Llano an Edenic quality.\n\nThe problems that undid the colony were internal dissension and an inadequate water supply. A group of dissidents, who met secretly at night in the surrounding sagebrush, deeply disrupted community discussion and debate. In fact, the \u201cbrushers\u201d might have been saboteurs planted by Los Angeles Times publisher Harrison Gray Otis, who had opposed Harriman\u2019s mayoral campaign and was known for his underhanded tactics.\n\nWhen a conflict over water rights arose between the colony and neighboring citizens of the Big Rock Water District, Llano had to go to court over its right to irrigate. The opposing attorney referred to the group as \u201csocialist plunderers,\u201d and the case was lost. From that moment on, the failure of Llano was inevitable.\n\nIn 1918, a splinter group moved to a site in Louisiana, where they survived in a limited form for the next twenty years.\n\nIn the 1940s, Aldous Huxley lived for a year in a house that had belonged to the original Antelope Valley colony\u2014he wanted to absorb any remaining utopian karma. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
