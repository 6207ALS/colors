    "short_description": "Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio earned great notoriety for his revolutionary style and for his unconventional process of painting directly from live models. The special loan of Orazio Gentileschi's The Lute Player from the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC enables us to show how four other painters in early 17th-century Rome assimilated his style in their own distinct ways. The Lute Player joins three other Caravaggesque paintings from the Art Institute's collection by Giovanni Baglione, Bartolomeo Manfredi, and Cecco del Caravaggio.",
