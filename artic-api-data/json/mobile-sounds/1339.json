    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: First floor, watch your step please. First floor, North La Salle Street. Oh. Sorry if I startled you. I've said that so many times it just comes natural standing here. Of course when I said it, I was on the other side of these gates. If you can't quite tell what you're looking at, I'm the man to fill you in. These gates were once part of the elevators in one of the most magnificent buildings in Chicago or anywhere else. I should know. I was the head elevator operator there for 37 years. The building was the Chicago Stock Exchange on La Salle Street, and every bit of it was as beautiful as these gates. All those looping vines and swirling leaves and starbursts at the top kept my attention all those years, and the gates below, they kept people safe when the elevator arrived on your floor. &lt;audio clip&gt; Going up. When the elevator went up or down, you could see right through the gates into the empty elevator shaft. &lt;audio clip&gt; Thirteen stories up. A real skyscraper. The Stock Exchange Building is long gone now. Well, so am I for that matter, but I like to come around here and visit and remember.  Take as long as you like to admire those gates. I'm off duty now, so you'll be waiting a long time for the elevator. So long.</p>\n",
