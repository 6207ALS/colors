    "description": "<p>In 1977 a fire destroyed a vast body of Martin Puryear\u2019s sculpture, as well as many of the artist\u2019s worldly possessions. Resulting in what he called \u201ca period of grieving followed by an incredible lightness and freedom\u201d the event proved pivotal in directing the artist\u2019s subsequent work. One year later, Puryear began a series of sculptures around the themes of movement and shelter. <em>Sanctuary</em> embodies what he described as \u201cmobility with a kind of escapism, of survival through flight.\u201d The sculpture appears to be in a state of arrested motion. This whimsical and sophisticated work reconciles a longing for stability with a need for change. By pairing the wild tree saplings with a carefully fashioned shelter, Puryear celebrated the beauty of wood in both its natural and refined states.</p>\n",
