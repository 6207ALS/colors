    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Art Institute's Denise Mahoney.</p>\n<p>DENISE MAHONEY:  And what I find interesting about his religious pictures, is the light is very important. The focus is almost off the painting, it's what's happening to the lower left as these disciples are contemplating what has happened, as they look into Christ's tomb and see that he is not there.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The artist Henry Tanner was a devout Christian, who moved to Paris in search of artistic opportunities, unavailable to him as an African American in the United States.</p>\n<p>DENISE MAHONEY: Henry Tanner was born in the East Coast in the United States, African American, son of a prominent minister. Knew from an early age that he did want to be an artist, but encountered a great deal of.. racial discrimination during his education and afterwards. He first went to Paris in 1891 and studied there, came back in 1893 just for a short time, less than a year. And then after that returned to Paris to live permanently. He was commercially successful, he wanted to do these religious subjects and stayed very focused. But at the same time, his art was welcomed and he did find.. a great deal of openness in France, not only based on race but also based on what he wanted to paint.</p>\n",
