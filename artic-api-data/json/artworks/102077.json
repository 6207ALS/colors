During a raid tribes tried to loot his tomb, only to find that it was protected by a giant poisonous snake.</p>\n<p>Known for his prints of historical figures, wars, legends, and social customs, Tsukioka Yoshitoshi is often considered the last master of ukiyo-e (pictures of the floating world), a Japanese art style that flourished from the 17th to the 19th centuries. He produced his first signed print when he was 14 and became an independent artist at age 20.</p>\n",
