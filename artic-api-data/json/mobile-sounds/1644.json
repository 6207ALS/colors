    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This striking depiction of an older man was painted by the French 18th century artist Jean-Honore Fragonard.  Fragonard is best known for his playful scenes of fashionably dressed lovers in idyllic gardens, commissioned to decorate his aristocratic clients' houses.  He also painted a series of male and female heads, including this wonderfully craggy old man.  The exact meaning or identity of most of the heads in this series is still unknown.  Like this man, several wear costumes that seem to allude to the past, or perhaps to theatrical garb.  These paintings are full of painterly brio and virtuosity.  Some even bear labels stating that they were painted in an hour.  This man's pose may be a witty artistic allusion.  He leans on a pedestal, with his other hand on his hip, recalling sitters in Grand Baroque portraits of kings and aristocrats.  Yet Fragonard undercuts the grandeur of the pose by emphasizing the man's droopy eyes, his reddened nose and cheeks, and flowing beard.  He seems to exaggerate his appearance almost to the point of caricature.  Notice Fragonard's extraordinary free way of painting.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: You can see the brushstrokes in the background in the lighter tones, where the artist has really imbued the painting with an energy and a vigor, and the freedom of the costume, the open chemise, this vest that's sketched in, have sort of a levity and a lightness that really does give this painting a theatrical air.</p>\n",
