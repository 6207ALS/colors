    "description": "<p>This kid-friendly picture book biography celebrates the irrepressible individuality of Surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed.</p>\n<p>Salvador Dal\u00ed just couldn\u2019t help being himself. When he was little, he wasn\u2019t like the other children; he was a daydreamer who liked to play pretend. When he grew up, he became an artist, but he didn\u2019t want to make art that looked like everyone else\u2019s. He became the most famous painter of his time after he made a picture of melting clocks. He liked to do wild, attention-grabbing things: He drove a fancy car stuffed with 1,000 pounds of cauliflower. He gave a speech inside a deep-sea diving suit. And he took his pet ocelot Babou to lunch at snooty restaurants. He designed lollipop wrappers in exchange for free candy, a lobster phone that really worked, and a hat made out of a shoe! Here\u2019s the true story of the one and only Salvador Dal\u00ed, an artist who never stopped being himself.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 9 x 11 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 40</li>\n<li><strong>4-8 years</strong></li>\n</ul>",
