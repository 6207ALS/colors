    "description": "<p>This extraordinary four-sheet popular woodcut makes the saint very much France\u2019s own. Pilgrims in the background on their way to Saint James of Compostela visit the cave where Mary Magdalene is said to have lived in the Saint-Baume mountains near Marseille, having traveled miraculously from the Holy Land. This print was likely sold at Sainte-Baume or another French pilgrimage site. Its borders depict relics of the Magdalene (head, arm, and hair) and a vial of Christ\u2019s blood, all of which still survive despite the looting of their protective golden reliquaries during the French Revolution.</p>\n",
