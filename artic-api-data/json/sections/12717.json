Firms like Gorham Manufacturing Company and the International Silver Company quickly incorporated new, modern forms into their product lines, bringing in well-known designers to propel sales of contemporary silver ware, a rare practice among American manufacturers prior to this time. Jean George Theobald\u2019s three-piece tea set with tray for the Wilcox Silver Plate Company, a division of International Silver, exemplifies these trends. Executed in silver, silver-plated nickel, and the relatively new material of Bakelite, his unique design reflects the clean lines and emphasis on geometry associated with Art Moderne, or Art Deco, while also anticipating the streamlined aesthetic that would gain favor in the 1930s. The set consists of three wedge-shaped objects for tea, cream, and sugar, each bearing a round Bakelite knob at the top and a thick Bakelite handle that runs up the side of the vessel. When placed together, the components form a circle that fits snugly in a round tray. The smart, interlocking service was advertised as a \u201cstriking and efficient unit,\u201d hailed as \u201ccompact to fit into the scheme of daily living.\u201d\n\nChanges in residential living patterns brought about a new demand for such space-efficient products, as apartments increasingly became an acceptable housing choice for the middle and upper classes. Small, multipurpose designs were offered in all areas of home furnishing in order to appeal to the growing trend of high-rise living, and the Art Institute\u2019s tea set was certainly oriented toward these modern accommodations. Marketed in Vanity Fair as one of International Silver\u2019s \u201cdecorative expressions of today,\u201d this set, along with three other similar designs, was extolled as \u201cbeautifully appropriate for modern apartments with smaller rooms, where an effect of spaciousness is desired.\u201d A far cry from the expansive tea services of the nineteenth century, Theobald\u2019s set was described as \u201cideal from the practical point of view for use in dinettes, breakfast nooks, on little tables, or for tea wagons . . . easy to care for and tak[ing] up little space.\u201d The same advertisement also strategically aligned the modern wares alongside a Neoclassical set, stating that these new forms were \u201cin no sense \u2018experimental,\u2019\u201d but rather the \u201ccreations of practical designers who have sensibly studied the decorative trends of our times.\u201d By creating continuity between the old and the new, International Silver was attempting to expand the market beyond those already acquainted with modern design.\n\nThe process of electroplating silver deposits a coating of the material over a more affordable base metal, and it became the medium of choice for many manufacturers testing the modern waters. Silver plating was less of a financial risk than executing the same designs in sterling silver while also appealing to multiple economic levels since it was modern, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. The company had one of the more extensive outputs of modern silver-plated wares, which itdeclared \u201cnew sophistication in keeping with fine old traditions of silversmithing.\u201d While this set was machine-made, many of Theobald\u2019s designs were reportedly finished by hand, as his favored angular elements proved difficult to fabricate by mechanical means. Either way, his designs were met with approval; they were lauded in Creative Art as \u201cfine example[s] of what can be done in the ordinary run of production by an American commercial firm when it decides to appoint a modern designer of good judgment and sound taste.\u201d  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom (fig. 87.1)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">With Historical Design, Inc., New York, by 1999.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1999.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Downs (2001), pp. 39\u201341, cat. 9 (ill.).\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Theobald was credited for his designs for International Silver in the press.
