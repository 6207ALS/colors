As he kept Beatrix company in their rooms overlooking the Victoria Embankment and the Thames, the artist produced eight lithographs (cat. 154, cat. 155, cat. 156, cat. 157, cat. 158, cat. 159, cat. 160, and cat. 161), most of them images of the river drawn on transfer paper (cat. 154, cat. 155, cat. 156, cat. 157, and cat. 158). In Waterloo Bridge Whistler captured a scene of awakening life along the river and suggested the quietude of the far reaches of the Thames, still shrouded in the early morning mist. The time of day is confirmed by the alternative title Waterloo Dawn, with which he annotated two proofs of this lithograph (now in the Mansfield-Whittemore-Crown Collection, Chicago, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C). The artist had already produced a view of Waterloo Bridge at dusk, entitled Evening, Little Waterloo Bridge (cat. 155), in which he used the stump to suggest the soft, atmospheric effect of the sun setting in the evening sky. Here, to depict sunrise, he set the stump aside in favor of a more linear handling of the crayon that evokes the crisp morning air.\n\nWaterloo Bridge was probably the drawing transferred and proved by the Ways on 19 March 1896 (app. II.4), a little more than a week after the first two images from the Savoy group were printed.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (303 \u00d7 178 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (302 \u00d7 178 mm), signed, and signed and inscribed verso, in Whistler\u2019s hand, Waterloo Dawn.
