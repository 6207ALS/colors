    "description": "<p>During and directly after his student years, Lewis Baltz made what he called Prototypes, photographs of recent residential and commercial \u201csubarchitecture\u201d in his home state of California. They are among the earliest artworks to show the fascinating, disturbing transformation of the American landscape into an unending terrain of anonymous buildings; they are also among the first photographs to seek the starkly reductive forms of Minimalist and Post-Minimalist art \u201cout in the world.\u201d <em>Corona del Mar</em> is nearly devoid of shadows, making the image appear as shallow as the paper on which it is printed. Baltz emphasized this congruence by mounting the photograph onto board and rimming the perimeter with India ink. The Prototype Works isolate objects in the built environment and ask to be apprehended as image-objects in their own right.</p>\n",
