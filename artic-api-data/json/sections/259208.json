I, executed on the same paper). T. R. Way did not include this lithograph in the 1896 edition of his catalogue, but added it to the expanded edition of 1905, with the explanation that it had been \u201ca failure in the transferring.\u201d The transfer does indeed appear uneven, and the clumsiness of the drawing suggests that Whistler found the new materials awkward to use. The crayons and the heavily grained transfer paper he employed were too coarse for a detailed rendering of the complex spatial divisions and supports of the bridge. A fine needle applied to a metal plate was better suited to this kind of careful delineation, as demonstrated by two slightly later etchings of Thames bridges, The Little Putney, No. 1 (fig. 13a [K 179]) and Fulham (K 182).\n\nIn 1905 Way dated this subject to 1878. Later, in 1912, he remarked that all of Whistler\u2019s early transfer lithographs had been made in 1879.\n\nChicago: AIC, off-white plate paper (132 \u00d7 303 mm); MWC, ivory plate paper (155 \u00d7 342 mm).
