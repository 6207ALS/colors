    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This pair of griffin heads was once part of a group that circled the rim of an ancient cauldron. The Greeks used cauldrons as gifts to their gods and goddesses. Look closely at the base of each bronze head where the edge flares out from the neck. You can still see the remnants of rivets that once attached each griffin to the cauldron. The most prominent rivet is on the upper left edge of the right griffin. The griffin has the head of a bird and the body of a lion. It was known in Greek mythology for being a fierce guardian of gold. Although the legend of the griffin migrated from the East into Greece little is known about its origin. Recent research, however, suggests that this ancient story may have been inspired by the fossil remains of a dinosaur found at the base of the Altai Mountains at the western border of modern Mongolia. The dinosaur called the protoceratops has a beak like a griffin and four legs like a feline. The Altai Mountains themselves are known for their gold deposits. Is it possible that prehistoric travelers of the Silk Road who discovered the fossil near the gold combined the two to create this legend of the griffin?</p>\n",
