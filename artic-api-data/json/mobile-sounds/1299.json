    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This charming porcelain rabbit is a tureen. We can imagine him sitting on an English eighteenth century dining table filled with rabbit stew which could be ladled out once his top half was lifted off. His ears extend out to form a handle which presumably remained conveniently cool to the touch. The rabbit is modeled and decorated with great realism. Notice the hairs of his coat, not only painted on but also molded into his body over his back haunches. He nibbles on a halfly [ph?] finished leaf which is playfully provided with a little snail trying to crawl away. The rabbit was made at the Chelsea porcelain manufactory which was established in London in 1745 by the silversmith Nicholas Sprimont. Sprimont was equally talented in created new table wares with delicate painted imagery as well as fanciful purely decorative figures such as birds, animals, shepherds and shepherdesses. This rabbit bridges both areas in being functional as well as ornamental. Nearby you can see another tureen in the form of a hen.</p>\n",
