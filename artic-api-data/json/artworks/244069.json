    "description": "<p>During his reign as prime minister (1978\u201384), P. W. Botha, a staunch defender of apartheid, established a council to advise the president on equitable state reform. The council was composed of appointees from the communities known, under the official system of racial segregation, as \u201cColored\u201d (meaning multiracial), \u201cIndian\u201d (meaning South Asian) and \u201cAsian.\u201d Weary of Botha\u2019s duplicity, blacks rebuffed invitations to join.</p>\n<p>In this witty broadside, Thamsanqa Mnyele placed Botha\u2019s head in the bowels of a gramophone machine. Three dogs\u2014symbolizing the council\u2019s racial diversity\u2014obediently absorb their \u201cmaster\u2019s voice\u201d (a reference to a 19th-century recording industry trademark). Mnyele uses this image to critique Botha\u2019s self-serving cultivation of politicians who would do his bidding and that of the country\u2019s white elite.</p>\n",
