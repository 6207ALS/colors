    "description": "<p>Initially affordable only among the wealthy, glass was used in ancient Rome as containers for oils, perfume, and tablewares. The variety of glass-making techniques reveals the changing tastes and fashions over the centuries. During the 1st century A.D., cast glass was a novel form that was a luxury for the Roman household, but by the end of the century, the innovation of blown glass - the technique used to create this vessel -  allowed for less labor-intensive and less expensive production and meant people of lesser means could afford it. Blown glass  became so popular it nearly supplanted ceramic and even bronze wares in the home.</p>\n<p>Colorless glass, like this beaker is made from, was particularly sought after because of its resemblance to rock crystal, a highly valued quartz stone that required special skills to cut decoration into its surface. Minerals are added to create different colors of glass, but clear glass must be decolorized, a process that was perfected in Rome.</p>\n",
