    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This twelfth century water vessel or ewer resembles a duck but the wings look too small for the body. And the head has a cockscomb. The tail feathers sweep up into an intricate handle. A human figure stands on the bird\u2019s back holding a bowl. The elaborate garments in this figure were incised in the clay before firing along with the details of the bird\u2019s body. The rich green blue glaze demonstrates the glowing color and subtle shifts in tone characteristic of Korean celadon ware. Ceramic artists in Korea developed this glaze in imitation of Chinese celadon ware. Korean artists\u2019 mastery of glaze ceramic techniques in the Silla period laid the foundation for the innovative styles of the later Goryeo period examples of which you can also see in this gallery. Korean celadon glaze contains iron which takes on varying shades of green and blue when fired in an oxygen reduced kiln. Look closely for areas that brown slightly during firing where the glaze was applied thinly. The glaze naturally pooled in carved and concave areas giving them deep blue green color. Around the time this ewer was made, a Chinese envoy to Korea reported that the Chinese admired Korean celadon ware as surpassing their own saying it possessed quote, \u201cThe radiance of jade and the crystal clarity of water.\u201d</p>\n",
