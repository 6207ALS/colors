The gallery was divided into six bays and, at its eastern end, adjoined the Salon Carr\u00e9, which contained the \u201cgems of the collection.\u201d Whistler\u2019s lithograph shows the eastern bay of the Grande Galerie, where paintings by masters of the Italian High Renaissance were displayed. His choice of subject matter follows the eighteenth-century tradition of depicting groups of spectators studying and copying works of art in museums and princely collections (see fig. 86a). Whistler captured not only the scale of the long room, but also the quality of light and the glassy character of its highly polished floor. With only a minimal use of the stump in the half-dome above the doorway, he further emphasized the depth of the view.\n\nThe Long Gallery, Louvre was probably one of \u201ctwo new drawings\u201d that Whistler sent to the Ways in London on 17 July 1894 (letter 94). In a letter mailed two days earlier, the artist had informed his printers that he had been approached by Gleeson White about a second lithograph for The Studio, the well-known art magazine that had published his Gants de su\u00e8de (cat. 35) in April 1894 (letter 93). White\u2019s request reached Whistler in the midst of prolonged deliberations concerning the publication of a lithograph in another British periodical, The Art Journal. By July 30 Whistler was finally able to tell T. R. Way that had chosen Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81) and that he had agreed to let The Studio publish The Long Gallery, Louvre (letter 99).\n\nWhistler\u2019s correspondence with the Ways reveals that when he ordered sets of twenty-five impressions of most of the eleven lithographs executed in July, the printers did not have enough of the \u201cbeautiful Japanese\u201d and \u201cDutch\u201d papers to fill the printing order and used an assortment of odd sheets they had on hand (see letter 102). In July or early August, Thomas Way finished printing the order for twenty-five impressions of The Long Gallery, Louvre. There is no record of later printings in the correspondence, with the exception of the large edition that the Ways machine printed for The Studio in August. Whistler insisted that a clear distinction be made between his hand-pulled \u201cproofs\u201d and the \u201cprints\u201d that were mechanically printed from supplementary stones. He reminded the Ways to put on all the periodical prints \u201calways the name of the Publication, somewhere in small type\u201d (letter 100). This was not done in the case of The Long Gallery, Louvre, nor had it been done earlier when Gants de su\u00e8de was editioned for The Studio. The periodical impressions were instead embossed with the blind stamp of The Studio.\n\nVariations in inking resulted in different effects in the area of stump work in the half-dome. In some impressions the stumping is readily apparent, while in others there is only the slightest trace that the stump was employed. A few impressions, such as one in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., were printed by hand on The Studio\u2019s distinctive ivory wove paper (often discolored to cream; see paragraph 8), outside the machine-printed published edition. These may be recognized by the absence of the blind stamp, by their full sheet size, and because they are likely to be signed in graphite with the artist\u2019s butterfly.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (323 \u00d7 206 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (337 \u00d7 237 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (6), cream Japanese paper (278 \u00d7 202 mm); cream laid Japanese vellum (340 \u00d7 210 mm); cream laid paper (258 \u00d7 207 mm); cream laid paper (259 \u00d7 207 mm), signed; cream laid Japanese vellum (338 \u00d7 202 mm); cream laid paper (259 \u00d7 206 mm). London: BM, cream wove paper (282 \u00d7 203 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (257 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; NGA (2), cream wove paper (296 \u00d7 212 mm), signed; cream laid Japanese vellum (335 \u00d7 238 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Ann Arbor, UMMA; Boston, MFA; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.\n\nPublished edition. The Long Gallery, Louvre was published in The Studio 3, no. 18 (15 September 1894). The periodical edition was machine printed from supplementary stones by Thomas Way between 10 and 28 August 1894. The paper used for The Studio edition was ivory wove, often discolored to cream, smooth on the recto and with a slight surface texture on the verso. The paper was embossed at lower right with the blind stamp of the periodical. Many impressions have been extracted from the periodical and trimmed to remove the blind stamp, usually leaving a sheet about 260 mm in height. Any sheet much larger than this dimension and not bearing The Studio\u2019s blind stamp is not a trimmed periodical impression, but rather one of the few impressions that Way seems to have pulled by hand on the same paper used for the periodical edition (see paragraph 5).\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream wove paper (298 \u00d7 206 mm), with blind stamp, rebound; cream wove paper (260 \u00d7 209 mm). Glasgow: HAG, cream wove paper (297 \u00d7 208 mm), with blind stamp. London: NAL, ivory wove paper (252 \u00d7 202 mm), with blind stamp, bound. Washington: LC, cream wove paper (295 \u00d7 209 mm), with blind stamp.\n\nRemarks: Impressions from the periodical edition are found in many museum and library collections, including Boston, BPL and MFA; Cambridge, Mass., FAM; New York, NYPL; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.

Identified by their stock numbers, these are the impressions now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and in the Mansfield-Whittemore-Crown Collection, on deposit at The Art Institute of Chicago. Both were printed on nearly identical sheets of cream Japanese vellum, quite clearly \u201cthe beautiful Japanese\u201d paper to which Whistler repeatedly referred during this summer of intense lithographic activity.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 86, only state.
