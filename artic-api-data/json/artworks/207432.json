    "description": "<p>Comparing these two prints reveals the benefits of cold storage. Both images were produced at the same time, but since then each has been stored in a different environment for a significant length of time. The two photographs come from different copies of the portfolio St. Louis and the Arch, which Joel Meyerowitz photographed in the late 1970s and had printed in an edition of 75 in 1980. In December 1995, the copy on the left entered the collection and was immediately placed in cold storage. In December 2010, 15 years later, the copy on the right was acquired. The yellowed margins and color imbalance in the latter version shows the difference made by many additional years of storage at room temperature.</p>\n",
