The old barns and crosses built by the region\u2019s French settlers fascinated O\u2019Keeffe, as did the lush green terrain, which she featured in <em>Green Mountains, Canada</em>. In this panoramic landscape, she captured the massive appearance of the mountains as they rise sharply from the water\u2019s edge. Although she enjoyed her trip to Canada, and returned again that year, ultimately O\u2019Keeffe preferred the New Mexican landscape, specifically its brilliant sunshine.</p>\n",
