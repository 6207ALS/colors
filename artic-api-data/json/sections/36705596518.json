Harrison Collection, 1933.896\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet created Caricature of Eug\u00e8ne Marcel using soft, broad graphite lines on a slightly textured, gray wove paper. The paper color serves as a middle tone for the composition. The artist worked out the figure with light, quick strokes of graphite, followed by darker, broader lines to more fully establish the form. Touches of white chalk were used to create the man\u2019s shirt. The profile of the figure\u2019s face remains sensitively rendered with fine graphite strokes.\n\nGray, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nUniform, with several wood and fiber inclusions.\n\nEven.\n\nThe edges are irregularly trimmed. The side and top edges are cut, while the bottom edge is torn as if along a straight edge or from a former binding, resulting in several small edge tears.\n\n239 \u00d7 136 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using the side of soft graphite to establish the outline and the form of the figure. Tonal effects were created using the side of the graphite in a back-and-forth motion to produce diagonal lines. There are a few areas of smudging of the graphite, although this appears to be offset rather than a result of the artist intentionally smudging the graphite. The point of the graphite was then used to further define the figure\u2019s outline and to establish details. The artist used touches of white chalk to highlight certain areas, such as the collar and shirt of the figure.\n\nThere is a faint profile of a person in graphite on the verso (fig. 6.1).\n\nThe composition was drawn directly onto the paper support. There is minor reworking at the top of the figure\u2019s forehead, the tip of the nose, and the lips. The curvature of the figure\u2019s forehead was reworked to create a more rounded head, and the tip of the nose was slightly lengthened and reinforced with a darker graphite line. In addition, the top lip was lengthened and extended out, while the bottom lip was redrawn slightly lower and shortened (fig. 6.2).\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. There is light surface soiling and discoloration overall. Smudges from handling are evident at the upper right and lower right edges. Light discoloration is visible throughout, except along the very edges of the paper, which were protected from light exposure by a former window mat. Along the edges of the overall discoloration there is a faint brown mat burn line. There are many brown foxing spots throughout the sheet on the recto; there are no brown foxing spots visible on the verso. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, hundreds of foxing spots that are not visible in normal conditions fluoresce yellow. There is a faint, vertical graphite line along the right edge of the paper support. Under magnification, the paper fibers are slightly distorted and lifting. The lower right corner appears to be an old repair. The paper used to fill the loss may be of the same manufacture but is slightly lighter in tone. The edge of the repair slightly overlaps the original paper support, and it is reinforced on the verso with a white Japanese paper mend. The media are in good condition with no losses noted. Under magnification there are two small spots of black ink in the figure\u2019s cheek and coat.\n\nThe drawing was treated in 2005 to reduce the appearance of the foxing spots on the recto. The old repair was maintained.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D490 (ill.), D491 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
