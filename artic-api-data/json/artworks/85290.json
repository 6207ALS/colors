Peru is home to a variety of predatory felines, including the jaguar, puma and pampas cat, which were feared for their hunting skill and worshipped for their ties to the otherworldly powers of the nocturnal world. Rulers throughout the ancient Andean realm expressed their identities as warriors and protectors of their communities by taking on the attributes of the fearsome cats in their personal adornment.</p>\n",
