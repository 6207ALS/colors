    "transcript": "<p>James Oles: By the 1940s, Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo was a fully independent photographer. She\u2019d been separated Manuel Alarez Bravo since 1934 and she was doing a lot of independent work, especially for the Mexican government.</p>\n<p>Valentina: Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo was one of the photographers working for a journal for education called Maestro Rural or Rural Teacher. This journal was part of the initiatives promoted by the government, which was attempting to unite the country after the revolution through education and literacy.</p>\n<p>She also produced photomontages. This was while working for that journal she started producing photomontages.</p>\n<p>James: She called those her \u201cchambas\u201d these little jobs that she did.</p>\n<p>Zoe: She used her artistic practice to really illustrate the social, cultural, political life of the country and I believe you can see this very much in her photomontages.</p>\n<p>Valentina: They reflect very much the moment of the country and the development, the urban development especially.</p>\n<p>Zoe: And often her photomontages are quite ambiguous. You\u2019re never sure if they\u2019re celebrating the countries economic boom or a critique of that.</p>\n<p>James: If we look at some of the photomontages I think from our vantage point today, when we\u2019re very suspicious about development, we\u2019re suspicious about the destruction of old architecture and the creation of skyscrapers and the ubran cost of all of that. We\u2019re more critical of that than people were in the 1950s when there was a sense of euphoria. Everybody was enthusiastic about the Mexican government in the 1950s/60s. This is a time of tremendous growth in the country, expansion of Mexico City in particular, new government projects being built.</p>\n<p>Zoe Ryan: Lola \u00c1lvarez Bravo and Clara Porset were not only good friends but also collaborated together. Throughout her career, \u00c1lvarez Bravo photographed many of Porset\u2019s projects, creating images that Porset used to promote her work in magazines and books. She also photographed the exhibition Art in Daily Life and took many of the photographs that are in the catalogue to that show. For much of Porset\u2019s work that no longer exists, it is because of \u00c1lvarez Bravo's photograph that we understand the extent of Porset's practice, the impact she had on design in Mexico at this time, and her incredible legacy.</p>\n",
