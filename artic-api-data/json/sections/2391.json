The artist had drawn from models since his earliest training at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, and its value to him was reflected in its role in his own art school, which he founded at the beginning of 1908. Matisse formulated a rather traditional training for his students, which included study after antique sculpture casts as well as live models (see fig. 12\u201313.1). Submitting to nature was an important exercise in drawing, and his regular Saturday critiques focused on encouraging his students to find its essence in their work. As one of his most important pupils, Sarah Stein, recorded in her notes from Matisse\u2019s class: \u201cOne must always search for the desire of the line, where it wishes to enter or where to die away. Also always be sure of its source; this must be done from the model.\u201d\n\nStanding Female Nude with Chair belongs to a group of works (see fig. 12\u201313.2, fig. 12\u201313.3, and cat. 15) featuring heavy-limbed figures with emphatic contours and dramatic shading that convey a sense of weight and sturdiness, even in their hair. In this drawing, Matisse used soft graphite to define his model\u2019s form and his stump, or estompe, to blend it gently into fleshy volume. There is a noteworthy compactness in the figure. Rooted by her heavy legs, which swell and fit over her hips, each successive part grows to connect firmly into the next. The approach recalls Matisse\u2019s vivid words to his students: \u201c[when drawing the figure], the pelvis fits into the thighs and suggests an amphora. Fit your parts into one another and build up your figure as a carpenter does a house. Everything must be constructed\u2014built up of parts that make a unit: a tree like a human body, a human body like a cathedral.\u201d\n\nSeated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool likewise both reveals Matisse\u2019s great understanding of structure and also complicates it. Here, the model is seated with one foot resting upon a low stool, bending forward slightly. She is presented in profile with her hands on her hips, and the gently hunched pose emphasizes the body\u2019s axial relationships, particularly the shoulders and spine and the legs and pelvis. Matisse worked this image in soft graphite but employed little stumping; instead, he used the broad end of the pencil to render thicker contours and thus convey a sense of volume. The artist\u2019s words to his students once again bring fresh insight to the image: \u201cOne must not forget the construction lines, axes of shoulders and pelvis, nor of legs, arms, neck, and head. This building up of form gives its essential expression. Particular characteristics may always heighten the effect, but the construction must exist first.\u201d While Matisse included little detail in the model\u2019s body, he added an elaborate hairstyle, unusual for his drawings at this time. He exerted a fair amount of pressure on his pencil to render the hair and used a decidedly lighter touch for the body, perhaps imagining the detail of the head as a counterbalance\u2014or as Stein wrote in her notes, as \u201coppositions which create the equilibrium.\u201d\n\nThe artist\u2019s esteem for the study of the figure in studio practice is reflected not only in his teaching but also in the way he presented himself to the public in his first North American exhibitions, which were held at Stieglitz\u2019s pioneering New York modern art gallery, the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, 291 Fifth Avenue. Standing Female Nude with Chair was included in the artist\u2019s 1908 debut. The works were likely selected by Matisse and the exhibition coordinated by the photographer Edward Steichen. Introduced as the products of \u201cthe leading spirit of a modern group of French artists dubbed \u2018les Fauves,\u2019\u201d the predominantly ink and watercolor nudes drew a range of reactions. While some appreciated the artist\u2019s line, most critics identified an element of \u201cugliness\u201d in the works that, combined with the subject matter, led to an eventual accusation of \u201cindecency.\u201d By 1909 Stieglitz was planning a second exhibition, noting later that it came \u201cat a time when the name, Matisse, is being used indiscriminately to explain the influence to which any painter at present may have succumbed whose work is unacademic . . . \u2018Influenced by Matisse\u2019 has become the common explanation of anything that seems queer, any departure from the old standards of artistic representation.\u201d Once again, the artist chose to exhibit figure studies; Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool was one of more than twenty-four works on paper (including fig. 12\u201313.2, fig. 12\u201313.3, and cat. 15) that were presented alongside a selection of black-and-white reproductions of major paintings, such as Le bonheur de vivre (1905\u201306; Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia) to demonstrate how the drawings related to his larger intentions. The exhibition, which opened on February 23 and ran until March 8, met with a more favorable response from critics than the first. Stieglitz later reprinted many of the reviews in his journal Camera Work, using the content of the exhibition as proof of Matisse\u2019s grounding and solid foundation: \u201cThe recent exhibition exemplified positively the power and sanity of the man, his scientific and almost mathematical attitude toward form, his almost Oriental sense of decorative spotting, so irreconcilably opposed to some of the more emotional tendencies for which critics have tried to make him responsible.\u201d  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\nJan. 1966: Nude Resting Knee on Chair/Nu, genou sur une chaise (UCLA Arts Council and UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse, exh. cat.
