    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This bronze statue of Buddha was made in the 11th or 12th century at the southern tip of India, a part of the subcontinent ruled by a dynasty of kings known as the Chola.  Some of the symbolism is familiar from earlier Buddhist sculpture, such as the dot between the eyebrows signifying wisdom.  His hand gestures-- the right offering reassurance, the left outstretched and giving-- are long established in Buddhist, as is the pointed flame atop the Buddha's head, which stands for the light of true knowledge.  But the gracefully draped robe, with its scalloped folds at the hem, are newer motifs, arising from the mixture of cultures in the Chola empire.  At its height, this empire extended from Northern India and across the sea to Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia.  Commerce flourished, with trade partners ranging from the Near East to China.  The arts were generously supported and bronze sculpture, such as this work, reached a rare degree of elegance and sophistication.  This statue was cast in the major South Indian port city of Nagapattinam, where monks and traders interacted and new artistic styles emerged.  This elegant bronze was purchased with funds from an endowment established by Samuel M. Nickerson, a Chicago banker and an early benefactor, who began donating art to the museum in 1900.</p>\n",
