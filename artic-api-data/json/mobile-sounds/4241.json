    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Welcome to Arms and Armor: Fashion, Politics, and Power. This audio tour is comprised of eight stops and spans the three galleries of the Arms and Armor collection. You'll begin with armor designated for the bodyguards of powerful Renaissance princes. You'll then enter the large gallery featuring weapons and armor used in the heart of battle as well as festive tournaments. Finally, you'll enter the last gallery, the princely gun cabinet, with elaborate firearms and other curiosities. Along the way you'll hear from curator Jonathan Tavarus, medieval historian Jonathan Lyon, jousting expert Tobias Capwell, and Renaissance fashion designer Jenny Tiramani. We hope you enjoy the tour and thank you for listening.</p>\n",
