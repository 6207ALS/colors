    "transcript": "<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: So this sculpture from Central India shows to beautiful maidens with their attendant between them. It comes from Central India. And what is important to recognize is that it would have come from a temple and you're wondering like a Hindu temple, a religious monument, what is it doing with these beautiful maidens on it?</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator Madhuvanti Ghose.</p>\n<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: But, in fact, Indian temples would always be adorned with beautiful maidens like these because there is a very important aspect to the way we adorn temples that is really poorly understood.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: Look at the way in which the bodies of these two sort of _______ have been shown with their body full on display basically dressing up getting ready to welcome their partner.</p>\n<p>&lt;music&gt;</p>\n<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: This kind of adorning of the female is a very important aspect that underlies Indian culture because Indian culture, at the end of the day, is still primarily an agrarian culture. And within agrarian societies the idea of fertility underlies everything. It is through the union of the male and female energy that life itself comes together and it's that aspect of the female energy that is celebrated when you see such women adorning a Hindu temple.</p>\n",
