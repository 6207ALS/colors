The earliest known American silver pitchers date from around 1800 and are patterned after so-called Liverpool jugs, English vessels made of cream-colored earthenware. Objects of this type are most often associated with Massachusetts silversmiths; eleven examples are known from the shop of Paul Revere, Jr. By about 1810 barrel-form pitchers, with or without covers and simulated hoops, were being fashioned by Ebenezer Moulton (see fig. 49.1), Jesse Churchill, and David Mosley, all also of Boston.\n\nWith the introduction of the sideboard to America during the Federal period, pitcher shapes became more varied as increasing importance was placed on properly dressing out this new focal point of the dining room. The sideboard\u2019s widespread popularity created the perfect stage for a display of wealth and taste through an array of gleaming silver and cut glass. In his House Servant\u2019s Directory (1827), Robert Roberts recommends, \u201cin setting out your sideboard, you must study neatness, convenience, and taste; as you must think ladies and gentlemen that have splendid and costly articles, wish to have them seen and set out to the best advantage.\u201d Often large and impressive, silver pitchers could easily dominate the arrangement of a handsomely appointed sideboard. Along with wine bottles and a lamp, a silver pitcher is prominently featured on the sideboard in Henry Sargent\u2019s famous painting The Dinner Party, from about 1821 (see fig. 49.2).\n\nThis pitcher by Cann &amp; Dunn exhibits a gracefulness and delicacy not often associated with Rococo Revival silver. More than fifteen inches tall, the form balances an ample belly with an elongated neck; freestanding leaf junctures strengthen the rather tenuous attachment of the slender, rusticated handle at its rim and shoulder. The success of the design is enhanced by the gradual transition of the silver surface from the flat engraving of the vines to the shallow relief of the chased grape leaves and the robustly rendered grape clusters. The overall effect is one of restrained elegance. While it is tempting to associate the grape motif with the serving of wine, this imagery also frequently appears on tea and coffee services from around this time, some of which included pitchers in addition to more typical forms (see, for example, fig. 49.3).\n\nJohn Cann and David Dunn advertised as manufacturing silversmiths in New York from 1855 to 1860 under the name of Cann &amp; Dunn, following the demise of their earlier partnership with Thomas Charters (see cat. 46). As was common during the mid-nineteenth century, Cann &amp; Dunn sold their wares both directly and through retail by firms such as John Cox &amp; Co., successors to J. &amp; I. Cox of New York City.  \nJanine E.

By 1861 John Cann and David Dunn appeared independently at Greene Street and Sixth Avenue, respectively. See H. Wilson (1860), pp. 139, 251; H. Wilson (1861), pp. 138, 249. These dates coincide with those offered for the partnership in Venable (1995), p. 317. For additional information, see Waters, McKinsey, and G. Ward (2000), vol. 2, pp. 457\u201358; Falino and G.

The working dates for John Cox &amp; Co. have been cited as 1854\u201356, but they continued to advertise in Trow\u2019s New York City Directory until 1863; the firm is not listed in the 1864\u201365 directory.
