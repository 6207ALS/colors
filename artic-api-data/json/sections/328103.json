The two women are seated at a grand piano, playing a duet by the light of a small lamp. The overall tonality of the lithograph is pale, and its handling summary. The transfer drawing for this image was executed on thin, transparent papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler had obtained from the printer Lemercier. It was of the same type\u2014characterized by a slightly irregular surface\u2014that Whistler used in August 1894 for the \u201cuntried transfer\u201d The Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 95) and, more successfully, for Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97) and La Belle Dame paresseuse (cat. 98). In a letter to T. R. Way of 12 August 1894, Whistler reported that he had \u201cgot hold of a new paper\u201d; two days later, when he sent Rue Furstenburg to the printers, his accompanying letter mentioned a \u201cpreliminary drawing\u201d that he had \u201ctried\u201d at Lemercier\u2019s shop (letters 103, 104). That drawing was almost certainly The Duet, No. 2. Whistler continued the account of his experience at Lemercier\u2019s by remarking that \u201cof course they have not your Father\u2019s art and the biting in was feeble\u2014and the result weak and comparatively poor\u2014though the proof still looks like a drawing on paper\u2014absolutely\u201d (letter 104).\n\nWhistler\u2019s lists of sales provide concrete evidence that The Duet, No. 2 predated the more elaborate version of the subject. On 15 August 1894 the artist sent four lithographs from Paris to the Fine Art Society in London. One of these was identified in his records as The Duet. Since the lithograph now titled The Duet (cat. 104) was transferred and printed two weeks later, on August 27 or 28, the impression sent to the Fine Art Society on August 15 must have been a different lithograph of the same subject. It then makes sense that the \u201cpreliminary drawing\u201d proved with Lemercier and referred to in Whistler\u2019s letter to T. R. Way of August 14 was indeed The Duet, No. 2.\n\nT. R. Way was clearly unaware of the identity of this \u201cpreliminary drawing.\u201d When he published his catalogue of Whistler\u2019s lithographs in 1896, he stated that Belfond had been the printer and assigned the title The Duet, No. 2 to this image, believing it to be the artist\u2019s second version of the subject. Whistler stated that he would \u201cdo another of the same subject\u201d (letter 120) in a letter to the printers written just after he received the first proofs of The Duet, so Way\u2019s assumption, though incorrect, was a natural one.\n\nIn 1901 Whistler instructed his pupil, Clifford Addams, to have this stone canceled in Paris, where it had been stored. Probably at Lemercier\u2019s, a printer pulled the canceled proof that Whistler ordered. That proof was bequeathed to the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, by Rosalind Birnie Philip in 1958.\n\nChicago: AIC, grayish ivory China paper (361 \u00d7 332 mm), signed.
