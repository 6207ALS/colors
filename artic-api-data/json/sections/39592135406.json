Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again using different methods and materials in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis hand-colored, third-state impression of Te po (The Night) is among a number that were printed in a later phase of the carving and compositional development of the block in which the artist adhered two sheets of absorbent Japanese paper together to obtain a surface that accommodated applications of transparent watercolor brushed over printing ink. It is very similar in palette and execution to impressions of Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.2), L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54.2), and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.2) in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.\n\nOverall, the hand-colored impressions have a more luminous quality, which is enhanced by the translucency of the Japanese papers. It is this very quality that likely appealed to Gauguin when working with delicate washes of color. The end results are certainly aesthetically quite different from other impressions in which transferred opaque media predominate. By comparison, impressions colored by the transfer of waxy, resinous media were printed on much sturdier papers.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 52.1.2).\n\nFor this print, the wood block was printed twice, first in brown ink and then in black ink. Gauguin then selectively wiped the black ink from the block so that, when printed over the brown ink layer, much of that tone would be visible. The carbon black ink was applied over brown ink that is a mixture of carbon black, vermilion, and chrome yellow or chrome orange. Once satisfied with his printed impression of Te po, Gauguin returned to it with brush in hand to add color. Red, two tones of orange, yellow, two tones of blue, silver-gray, and black watercolor were applied over the off-register double printing of the brown and black inks (fig. 52.1.3). The aqueous medium was readily absorbed into the Japanese paper and bled through to the verso. Examination of the verso reveals that more vibrant colors were initially used and have faded with overexposure to light (fig. 52.1.4). Passages of red and orange were especially affected. In the foreground, a spirit-like form extends horizontally into the composition from the left. It was hand colored with a bright orange composed of vermilion and cadmium yellow that has dulled in appearance with fading. The devil-like shadow to its right has additions of golden yellow. XRF and Raman microspectroscopy confirm that these golden yellow washes contain degraded cadmium yellow pigment that was originally bright yellow instead of the more gold-to-brown tone that exists in this impression, as well as others from the Noa Noa Suite, today. The oil lamp was toned with a second orange and more of the same golden cadmium yellow (fig. 52.1.5). The blanket that envelops the central figure was once washed with what might have been a pale-orange or pink tone. A silver-gray wash was used below and to the left of the figure\u2019s extended right arm. A more intense application of the same silver-gray was added above her arm; on the verso this same passage is more intensely black (fig. 52.1.6). To her left, cerulean-blue washes were added to the rolling forms around and above her. The silver-gray appears again to the far left and in the rolling form in the middle ground. Among the three looming figures to the right, vermilion red washes appear in those at left and right, while the central figure is toned with gray (fig. 52.1.7).\n\nGauguin adhered two sheets of thin, cream Japanese paper to each other to make a laminate. By laminating two sheets of Japanese paper together, he strengthened the support for printing and for applications of watercolor washes. A thinner wove paper layer lies beneath a slightly heavier laid paper layer. The paper fibers are distributed evenly and the paper is of a uniform color. In transmitted light the two sheets of Japanese paper, one laid and the other wove, can be seen more readily. The edges of the sheet are straight cut, although slightly irregular. The paper has been trimmed close to the printed image. Approximately 1\u20132 mm of paper margin remains around the image on all sides.\n\nGauguin selected fibrous, cream-toned Japanese papers for this and a number of other hand-colored impressions but not without modifying the papers in some way. Often Gauguin would laminate two distinctly different Japanese papers together, one with a laid pattern from the shu (mold) and the other wove, as in Maruru (cat. 55.2) and L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (cat. 54.2). Fine vertical creases are visible in all of the laminated sheets examined for this study. The creases formed as a result of sheet expansion and manipulation as the artist brush applied a dilute, water-soluble adhesive (perhaps starch-based) onto the sheets to adhere them to each other. Where Gauguin applied pressure to the papers with the brush to assure adhesion between them, he pulled and distorted the long paper fibers. On the verso of this print, fiber disruption and brush marks resulting from the lamination process are visible in raking light, as are the series of creases described above (fig. 52.1.1).\n\nThe chain line interval found in the laid paper top sheet is 35 mm wide with one irregular interval of 32 mm in the center of the sheet. Two additional hand-colored impressions created on laminated sheets are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. In these impressions, Maruru (cat. 55.2) and L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (cat. 54.2), the laid paper is pasted beneath the wove paper; however, the overall visual effect remains the same. The chain line intervals in Maruru and L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 are identical to those in Te po\u2014all are 35 mm wide, with the exception of one on the right side of the sheet that is 32 mm wide. Visually, the papers are all nearly identical to each other when weight, color, and surface texture are compared. In Te po, the wove paper used as the underlying sheet is of a lighter weight and tone than the wove paper used in these other impressions.\n\n204 \u00d7 355 mm (image); 207 \u00d7 358 mm (sheets)\n\nGauguin created this impression of Te po in several steps. First, he inked the wood block in brown. The first layer of ink was thinly applied overall. Pools of brown ink present on the paper are not the result of deliberate wiping or a transfer process but of an initial uneven distribution of printing ink onto the surface of the roller. This caused irregular striations of brown printing ink to appear on the block as ink was rolled out onto it from the roller, repeated at four-inch intervals across the length of the sheet (fig. 52.1.8). The artist made a second pass with the roller across the bottom half of the block and after printing, the bottom half of the impression appears darker and there is more ink present than in the upper half.\n\nGauguin then inked the block in black using lesser amounts of ink and selectively wiped away some of the black ink. As a result, the brown underlayer of ink predominates in the foreground, although Gauguin did go back with brush and black watercolor to reinforce a single line between foreground and middle ground. Two distinct horizontal black lines intersect the three figures on the right (fig. 52.1.9). These lines may be intentional, but it is more likely that in applying differential pressure to the tool used to facilitate the transfer of ink, this particular back-and-forth stroke resulted in the transfer of more ink than the artist intended.\n\nGauguin\u2019s choice of a fibrous ivory-toned Japanese paper to print this impression of Te po was quite intentional; he knew that the fibrous paper was absorbent and would readily accept the watercolor medium. Against the light paper tone the colors would have appeared quite vibrant. Over time, with exposure to light, the watercolor passages on the front of the print have faded significantly. The vibrancy of the colors selected by the artist is still evident on the verso, where the watercolor remains less faded in some areas and totally unfaded in others.\n\nThe hand-colored print was conserved in anticipation of this publication. When discoloration was removed from the sheet, its tone brightened significantly and the colors now appear more vibrant, as Gauguin would have intended. Comparison with watercolor passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape [Women at the River] [cat. 59.2]), and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with an ivory hue rather than a golden tone (fig. 52.1.10).\n\nThe thin, supple, laminated sheet displayed significant undulation throughout, especially vertically through the center. There are several pronounced creases that probably formed during printing. These include a strong vertical crease that runs from the top to the bottom of the sheet, 78 mm in from the left edge; a second strong vertical crease that runs from the bottom of the sheet through the center and then meanders to the left and right; and a third, very hard diagonal crease that appears to the right of center and measures 90 mm. The remaining fine vertical creases throughout are a result of sheet expansion and manipulation during the lamination process and probably formed when Gauguin brushed his water-soluble adhesive onto the papers to adhere the two sheets together. Using a coarse brush to apply pressure to assure adhesion, he disrupted the long, delicate Japanese paper fibers on the verso, as is readily visible in raking light.\n\nBefore conservation treatment, there were numerous dark-brown stains, especially in the reclining figure, that were very pronounced. There was also extensive foxing that was quite dark. The staining and foxing were much more evident in the margins and on the verso where printing inks did not obscure them. Under ultraviolet light the stains remain visible and fluoresce golden brown; white halos around them are indicative of oil (see fig. 52.1.2). It is quite likely that the staining occurred well after Gauguin printed this impression, since darkening of oil in this manner occurs over time. Staining from foxing fluoresces to a much lesser degree. At some point in the past the sheet was water damaged, as evidence by a pronounced tide line in the lower left that is much more visible on the back than it is on the front of the sheet. Under ultraviolet light, tide lines from water staining are very pronounced.  \nHarriet K.

Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF and Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nC\u00e9line Daher, XRF and Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nE.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
