    "description": "<p>Inspired by social media posts of second-hand items sold by Syrians and Lebanese in Lebanon, Mounira Al Solh reflects on the ongoing impact that war and crisis have on people in the Middle East region. Based on her exhibition<a href=\"/exhibition/mounira-al-solh-i-strongly-believe-our-right-be-frivolous\"><em> Mounira Al Solh: I strongly believe in our right to be frivolous</em></a>, the artist recollects how her family members had to sell some of their belongings to escape wars from as early as the 1940s to the present day; selling objects enabled people to flee or to survive a few more weeks under curfew. In personalizing disasters and in connecting networks over time, spaces, countries, objects, and in the imagination, this work reflects an ongoing and growing crisis.</p><p><em>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago. </em></p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
