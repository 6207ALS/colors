    "description": "<p>Chair and curator of the Arts of Africa Constantine Petridis describes this exhibition as \u201can exploration that seeks to decolonize the Western aesthetic standards long placed on these objects and to elevate the local indigenous perspectives of the works\u2019 makers and communities.\u201d By making space for new conversations,<em>&nbsp;this Slow Looking conversation&nbsp;</em>attempts to disrupt whatever preconceived notions we bring to the exhibition while pushing ourselves to think in unfamiliar and even uncomfortable ways. How might disruption ultimately inspire fresh appreciation for the nuance and power of the vast history of art from the largest continent in the world?</p><p>Please note that this will be a seated program.</p><p>If you have any questions about programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.
