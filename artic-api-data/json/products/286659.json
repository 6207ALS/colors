    "description": "<p>Timelessly beautiful - the Bordeaux ball pen of the Classic Sport series looks equally nostalgic and modern. The combination of this color and the golden elements is on point and conveys a particularly nostalgic charm.</p><p>The birth of the Kaweco Sport was back in 1911. The Classic series must not miss the writing system ballpoint pen. It has a length of 10.5 cm and works with a high-quality heart-curve mechanism. It works precisely and does not click when the push button is pressed.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 4.13 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Ball pen writing system</li></ul>",
