    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Russian artist Wassily Kandinsky made this painting in 1913 while living in Germany. Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Kandinsky really wanted to push painting into a realm that hadn\u2019t been explored and that meant abstraction. It meant looking for new ways of moving towards that kind of immaterial sort of form that music has. And, so, he looked at the materials that he would use traditionally for paintings, colors, forms, composition, and tried to find equivalences in reality. The color yellow, a color that\u2019s very prominent in this picture, would for Kandinsky suggest the taste of lemons or the sound of bells. And blue was a kind of heavenly color or restful color that could bring a balance to a picture.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Kandinsky\u2019s unconventional ideas about orchestrating color and emotion were an important contribution to a new movement called Expressionism. The Expressionists often used bold colors and distorted forms to heighten feeling in their compositions.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: This effort toward getting at a soul-stirring kind of experience is part of what Expressionism was in Germany at the turn of the century. Artists began to look for new ways to get at a more sincere emotional, psychological kind of connection with viewers.</p>\n",
