He created the name \u201cZzyzx\u201d for the health resort he built in the Mojave Desert, hoping it would be the \u201clast word\u201d in resorts. Zzyzx was a Christian resort predicated upon a belief in the curative powers of its mineral waters\u2014and the destructiveness of alcohol and arguing. Smoking, however, was acceptable everywhere but the dining room, bathhouse, sundeck and pool area (the prohibition in these areas related to concerns about the hazard of combining bare feet and burning cigarette butts).\n\nThe project began in 1944 when Springer filed a mining claim on an area of land eight miles long by three miles wide on the site of Hancock\u2019s Redoubt, an 1860 army outpost. Using laborers from skid row in Los Angeles, whom he paid with food and showers, he built a hotel on the street he called the Boulevard of Dreams, an airport (Zyport), and a health spa that included a cross-shaped pool and a mechanical exercise horse that had been in the White House during the presidency of Calvin Coolidge.\n\nZzyzx also had a radio station from which Doc Springer\u2019s nightly broadcasts were beamed to 221 radio stations in the US and 102 abroad. On the air Springer played religious music, preached his folksy religious philosophy, and sold his quack curative products: Hollywood Pep Tonic; Antediluvian Desert Tea, a peppermint herb brew; Zy-Pac, mineral salts from the bed of Lake Tuendae, which users were directed to rub on the scalp, then bend over and hold their breath as long as possible; and Mo-Hair, a purported baldness cure.\n\nIt was Mo-Hair that particularly incurred the ire of the American Medical Association and was instrumental in Springer\u2019s 1969 arrest and sixty-day jail sentence. At the same time, the IRS, the FDA and the Bureau of Land Management began legal proceedings against him.\n\nIn 1974, Springer and a few hundred of his followers were ejected from Zzyzx, despite his willingness to pay the government $34,187 owed in back rent. He died in Las Vegas in 1986 at the age of ninety. Zzyzx is now referred to by its earliest name, Soda Springs, and is used as the Desert Studies Center of the California State University system. Lake Tuendae has been discovered to be the home of a tiny endangered fish, the Mojave Tui Chub. \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
