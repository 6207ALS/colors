    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This incredibly tall elegant sculpture represents a serpent. It\u2019s sinuous wooden body painted with triangle and diamond patterns narrows before widening into a broad head with two circles for eyes. The sculpture was made in the late nineteenth or early twentieth century in Guinea West Africa. Its purpose is truly astounding. As you can see here the serpent was used as a headdress. It was tied to a conical framework of palm branches on the wearer\u2019s head. The great serpent seemed to rise mysteriously from a costume of cloth and palm fibers that covered the wearer\u2019s head and body. In the cultural traditions of the Baga and related peoples of coastal Guinea the snake spirit bestows the important gifts of rain, fertility and wealth. The serpent headdress was worn during initiation rights for young men or ritual competitions between different clans. Its wearer had to possess great strength. While balancing the wooden serpent on his head he performed a series of swift movements dipping and rotating his body so that the towering sculpture would seem to move in a convincingly snake like way. Large masks and headdresses such as those displayed on this platform were part of the ritual practices of coastal Guinea. Today, many of these masquerades continue to be performed as expressions of national identity and pride.</p>\n",
