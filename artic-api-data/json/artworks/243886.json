The artist lightly applied black chalk to capture the facial features and hair of his sitter. Compared to the passage\u2019s precision, the rest of the composition adopts a relatively abstract style. For example, the violin is only schematically described in outlines, and the viewer is left to imagine the bow that the figure should be holding in his right hand.</p>\n",
