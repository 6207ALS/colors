    "description": "<p>Linnaeus Tripe produced some of the earliest photographs ever made of British India and Burma. The British ruled large parts of India through the East India Company, a corporation with its own private armies and governmental functions. Tripe rose through the ranks of the Company\u2019s army and began to experiment with photography in the early 1850s, photographing temples and other Indian monuments. In 1855, James Broun-Ramsay, the British governor general of India, commissioned him to join a diplomatic mission to Burma as its official photographer to document architecture and points of interest. When the complete series was exhibited in 1857, the jury called the photographs \u201cexcellent; remarkable for great distinctness and also for their unusual and beautiful tint.\u201d In this photograph of the famous Buddhist Dhammayangyi temple, four disciples of Guatama Buddha are seated with lotus flowers as their footstools.</p>\n",
