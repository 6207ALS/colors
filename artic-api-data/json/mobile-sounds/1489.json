    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This fan-backed Windsor chair was made in Philadelphia around 1770. Its design is a simple one and yet discretely nods to the rococo style, then so fashionable, in the scrolling ends of its top rail and the serpentine curves of its arms. Windsor chairs were named after the English town with its royal castle near which they were originally produced. The design was probably introduced to America in the 1730s by an Englishman who came over to act as lieutenant governor of Pennsylvania. Windsor chairs, which were also made with arms, became extremely popular in Philadelphia and the design was soon adopted by chair makers across the country. Curator Judy Barter.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: This was rather common seating furniture in the Colonial Times and you can see why that might be the case, unlike a highly carved Chippendale or Queen Anne chair, these pieces could almost be mass produced. So this was fairly cheap furniture to make and it was in lots of public spaces, for example, in Independence Hall in Philadelphia. They\u2019re popular today, as well, just a Shaker furniture is popular today because those are forms that are viewed as simple and rather modern.</p>\n",
