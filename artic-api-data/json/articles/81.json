    "copy": " Over the last three weeks, visitors to the Art Institute have been able to witness the creation (or more accurately, re-creation) process firsthand. As part of an exhibition Contemporary Collecting: Selections from the Donna and Howard Stone Collection , a draftsman from the LeWitt Foundation has been working with staff from the Art Institute\u2019s contemporary art department to \u201ccreate\u201d Sol LeWitt\u2019s Wall Drawing #1111: A Circle with Broken Bands of Color (2003) in the Modern Wing\u2019s Griffin Court, in full view of the public. For those of you unfamiliar with LeWitt\u2019s work, much of it doesn\u2019t exist like most artworks do, as a tangible painting, drawing, or sculpture. Rather, it is a list of instructions on how to create the artwork. Takashi, the draftsman from the LeWitt foundation, brought a schematic with him. t's essentially a giant tape painting. The general layout and colors to be used are predetermined. Also, there are certain rules\u2014for example, no one block of color should ever come into contact with another block of the same color. No yellows touching yellows and so forth. The the exact order of the colors in the circular bands, however, are open for interpretation. They use Lascaux acrylic paints, if you're wondering. As a conceptual artist, LeWitt believed that it wasn\u2019t the finished work that was the \u201cart\u201d; art instead begins and ends with an idea. Check out the video below to watch the process unfold. ",
