First and foremost are the major funders whose generosity made this catalogue possible. The David and Mary Winton Green Research Fund provided a tremendous financial contribution to the research expenses, and for this we wish to especially thank Mary Winton Green, who has closely followed and applauded our progress. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation supported the scientific research focused on materials and the technical study of paintings. The purchase and maintenance of analytical equipment was made possible in part due to a generous grant from the Grainger Foundation. We would like to acknowledge the late Eloise W. Martin and the Community Associates of the Art Institute for their support of the X-ray fluorescence analyzers that have enabled noninvasive palette determination for the paintings. The Community Associates also supported the purchase of a new infrared camera, greatly enhancing our ability to study the works. We are grateful to Jan and William Jentes for exceedingly generous donations that allowed us to acquire Study for \u201cParis Street; Rainy Day\u201d and Self-Portrait with a Hat, two drawings that dramatically enhance our collection.\n\nThe creation of this volume was inspired in large part by the cleaning of Paris Street; Rainy Day by Paintings Conservator Faye Wrubel in late 2013 and the subsequent scholars\u2019 day in the spring of 2014, which brought the painting and its related preparatory drawing together. Presentations by Wrubel and Kelly Keegan, Assistant Paintings Conservator, with John K. Delaney, Senior Imaging Scientist at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., and the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at The George Washington University, Washington, D.C., provided the initial look at Caillebotte\u2019s working process and the fledgling theories demonstrating the drawing\u2019s importance to that process. For the lively and informative discussion that followed the presentations, we would like to extend our sincere thanks to all of the attendees.\n\nDuring the examination of Paris Street, the input of Pablo Garcia, Assistant Professor of Contemporary Practices at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, proved invaluable: his knowledge and expertise helped to provide missing pieces to the research puzzle.\n\nWe also wish to extend a special thanks to the eminent scholar who served as reader for this volume and provided important counsel and critique: Michael Marrinan, Professor of Art and Art History at Stanford University.\n\nCritical at all stages of the project were the insight and encouragement of Douglas Druick, President and Eloise W. Martin Director of the Art Institute. We are also grateful to Martha Tedeschi, Deputy Director for Art and Research, for her support of the digital scholarly cataloguing project, and to Sylvain Bellenger, Searle Chair and Curator, Department of European Painting and Sculpture. Our thanks to Genevieve Westerby, Research Associate, Department of European Painting and Sculpture, for her primary role as catalogue researcher and for her keen eye to detail. Her unremitting diligence and passion for the project were critical to its success.\n\nEssential to the important conservation component of this undertaking has been the support and guidance of Frank Zuccari, Grainger Executive Director of Conservation and Senior Paintings Conservator. Kelly Keegan worked unflaggingly to complete examinations, analyses, and writing in addition to creating the annotated overlays and photomicrographs for the digital format that so brilliantly reveal the artist\u2019s working process. She was also responsible for completing the exceedingly difficult task of compositing and registering hundreds of images for the interactive image overlay tool. Thanks are also owed to Kirk Vuillemot, Assistant Conservator for Framing and Preparation, for his detailed descriptions of the picture frames. As much as possible, this project has incorporated the most up-to-date analyses of painting materials and grounds, and for this we acknowledge Francesca Casadio, Andrew W. Mellon Senior Conservation Scientist; Federica Pozzi, formerly Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in Conservation Science; Inge Fiedler, Associate Research Microscopist; Celine Daher, Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in Conservation Science; Kimberley Muir, Assistant Research Conservator; and Ken Sutherland, Conservation Scientist.\n\nThe same intensity of examination, technical reporting, and imaging that has taken place for oil paintings has also been applied to the artist\u2019s works on paper under the supervision of Suzanne Folds McCullagh, Anne Vogt Fuller and Marion Titus Searle Chair and Curator of Prints and Drawings. Thanks to Antoinette Owen, Senior Conservator of Prints and Drawings, whose determination and unwavering attention to detail led to groundbreaking technical discoveries. Research and writing was the charge of Nancy Ireson, Rothman Family Associate Curator of Prints and Drawings. Critical research assistance was provided by Emily Vokt Ziemba, Collection and Exhibition Manager, and Julie Warchol, Research Assistant.\n\nThe project would not have been feasible without the expertise and support of the Art Institute\u2019s technology team. Special thanks to Tina Shah, Senior Systems Analyst for Collections, for her expert and dedicated work on the maintenance of and enhancements made to the ChicagoCodeX toolkit\u2014the open-sourced, digital publishing platform used to create this volume. Those overseeing the deeper infrastructure deserve our thanks for maintaining the security and reliability of servers on the back end: Raphael Jaffey, Director of Network Services; Stefano Cossu, Director of Application Services, Collections; and Mike Bingaman, Web Technology Coordinator.\n\nThis digital platform offered the unique opportunity to include multimedia features, and we are grateful to Tom Riley and William Foster in the Department of Media Production and Services for expertly producing the engaging, informative videos that explore Caillebotte\u2019s working method and the discoveries made during the technical examinations of Paris Street and its related drawing.\n\nFor the magnificent high-resolution color images, ultraviolet light captures, and archival photography of the works in this publication, we thank several members of the Department of Imaging: Louis Meluso, Director of Imaging Technology; Chris Gallagher, Director of Imaging; Bob Hashimoto, Senior Photographer for 3-D; Robert Lifson, Senior Photographer for 2-D; and Amy Zavaleta, Photographic Archive Coordinator. We are also grateful to P. D. Young, Production Coordinator, and Jonathan Mathias, Post-Production Technician.\n\nThis hybrid of scholarship and technological interactivity has demanded an innovative publishing template and a dynamic publishing team. We are grateful for the energetic leadership of Sarah E. Guernsey, Executive Director of Publishing, and the unfaltering support and editorial acumen of Greg Nosan, Editorial Director. We further extend our thanks to the talented editorial team that was involved in the preparation of the catalogue: Wilson McBee, Amy Peltz, Maia Rigas, and Christine Schwab, with Margherita Andreotti, freelance editor.
