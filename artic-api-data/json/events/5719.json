    "description": "<p><strong>We regret to inform you that this lecture has been cancelled. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and hope you can join us for future programs.</strong></p><p>Jeannie Kenmotsu, curator of Asian Art at the Portland Art&nbsp;Museum, discusses the resurgence of printmaking in postwar Japan and the woman artists who rose with it.</p><p>In the postwar period of the 20th century, Japanese printmaking experienced a revival fueled by enthusiastic foreign collectors, new commercial galleries, and a talented young generation. Printing on blocks, plates, and stones, women artists were among those drawn to the expressive potential of the medium in the early 1950s. Today, however, many of their stories are unknown\u2014despite the fact that their work is widely held in North American institutions and private collections. This lecture illuminates the women artists who forged ahead in creative new ways, both in and outside of the studio.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
