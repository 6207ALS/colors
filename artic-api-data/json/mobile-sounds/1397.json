    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A fierce moustached warrior seems to shout in triumph as a defeated demon writhes under foot. The mighty upward sweep of the overall composition suggests the warrior\u2019s other worldly power. Stylized dragon heads adorn his shoulder guards and his headdress is crowned by a phoenix-like bird. These fanciful details all emphasize the supernatural nature of this figure which was intended to protect the deceased in the afterlife. Guardian figures which appear in Hindu and Buddhist art seem to have accompanied the spread of Buddhism into China along the Silk Road where they encountered similar native traditions. By the time of the Tang dynasty these guardians watched over secular as well as religious grave sites. This fearsome warrior was probably even more terrifying when you first went into the tomb. You can see that his face and his phoenix headdress are unglazed. They were originally painted creating a dramatic contrast. A spear or other weapon in his left hand would have definitely frightened off any evil spirits or human intruders.</p>\n",
