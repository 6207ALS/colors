    "copy": " \"I wanted to tell stories!\" This is how painter Philip Guston explained the radical transformation of his paintings from delicate abstractions early in his career to surreal, apocalyptic narratives later on. The works executed in the last decade or so of his life depict a world populated by hooded figures, disembodied body parts, clocks, light bulbs, and various tools and materials found in a painter's studio. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
