The area had changed dramatically over the course of the nineteenth century, however, due in large part to the expanding rail network and the proliferation of travel guidebooks and illustrated publications. The small, rural fishing villages of the beginning of the century were rapidly transformed into seaside resorts for tourists and vacationers, altering the physical and social landscape in dramatic ways.\n\nNot only did the coastline and geological sites of Normandy become popular with tourists, they were also favorite subjects of many nineteenth-century artists, especially Monet, who painted the region\u2019s natural and man-made attractions hundreds of times during his career and is considered by many to be the \u201cgreatest visual poet of Normandy.\u201d Monet\u2019s seascapes of the 1860s\u2014the decade before he emerged as the leader of the Impressionist movement\u2014most often feature the coasts of Le Havre (on the northern bank of the estuary of the Seine), Honfleur (on the southern bank across from Le Havre), and, as in the present picture, Sainte-Adresse, a coastal suburb just northwest of Le Havre where the artist\u2019s aunt owned a villa. Scholars have noted that public opinion at this time was divided on the condition of Sainte-Adresse: some writers commented that \u201call the seductions of solitude, silence and oceanic contemplation still reign there,\u201d while others complained that it had \u201clost most of the rustic appearance which gave it its charm.\u201d In any event, Sainte-Adresse had certainly arrived in the public imagination by the mid-1860s, popularized in the writings of the French critic Alphonse Karr and documented by artists including painters Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, and Johan Barthold Jongkind, as well as photographer Gustave Le Gray (fig. 13.2 and fig. 13.3). It is through this complex lens that one must read Monet\u2019s The Beach at Sainte-Adresse.\n\nThe Beach at Sainte-Adresse was executed in the summer of 1867, an extraordinarily challenging time for Monet personally. Earlier in the year, upon learning that his companion, Camille Doncieux, was pregnant, Monet had moved into his aunt\u2019s home in Sainte-Adresse. In order to shield his disapproving family from the situation, he discreetly shuttled back and forth to Paris, where he had arranged for Camille to be cared for. Despite (or perhaps because of) his complicated personal life, Monet was productive during this period: by the end of June, he wrote from Sainte-Adresse to the painter Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille that he had \u201ctwenty or so canvases well under way, stunning seacapes, figures, and gardens, something of everything in fact.\u201d It was not the first time Monet had painted the coast of Normandy, or specifically Sainte-Adresse, however. Just two years earlier, he had made his debut at the 1865 Paris Salon with two large, ambitious seascapes of the region\u2014the Kimbell Art Museum\u2019s La Pointe de la H\u00e8ve at Low Tide (fig. 13.4 [W52]), a picture depicting the Sainte-Adresse beach looking northward; and the Norton Simon Museum\u2019s Mouth of the Seine at Honfleur (fig. 13.5 [W51]), which portrays Honfleur, situated at the mouth of the Seine across from Le Havre. These two works\u2014largely praised by Salon critics\u2014were painted in Monet\u2019s studio and based on smaller oil studies on canvas that he had previously made on location. Notably, in the Salon compositions as well as other paintings he made around this time, the artist downplayed the ongoing resort development in Normandy. With their rather muted, gray-and-brown-infused palettes, Monet\u2019s early seascapes predominantly depict brooding natural environments and feature Normandy\u2019s beaches and terrain as the workplaces of its local inhabitants and fishermen.\n\nMonet\u2019s seascapes from the summer of 1867, however, proved to be markedly different from those he had painted only a couple of years earlier. Beach exemplifies his evolving painting technique at this time and foreshadows some of the qualities that would later become characteristic of the Impressionist movement; indeed, the fact that Monet was represented by the painting at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876\u2014nearly ten years after it was executed\u2014is a testament to this. Perhaps the most striking change apparent in Monet\u2019s work from the summer of 1867 is that, unlike his earlier coastal landscapes, he painted Beach en plein air. Complaining of the difficulty of painting in this way, he wrote to Bazille in July: \u201cI am losing my sight. . . . I can barely see after working for half an hour; the doctor told me that I had to stop painting out of doors.\u201d The severe glare and changing weather conditions Monet experienced undoubtedly contributed to the choices of colors he used in creating these pictures. Indeed, the palette of Beach is blonder and brighter than those of his 1865 Salon seascapes. This is in large part the result of the artist\u2019s use of a lighter and cooler palette and his incorporation of more colorful elements into the composition (see Technical Report).\n\nThe paintings Monet executed in Sainte-Adresse in the summer of 1867 also differ from his earlier depictions in terms of their subject matter, for these pictures comprise the artist\u2019s \u201cfirst sustained campaign of painting that involved tourism.\u201d The viewer is immediately drawn to the visible aspects of local life in Beach\u2014dark-sailed fishing boats drift in the water, and other beached crafts are surrounded by fishermen and their equipment. The two groups of boats frame two figures sitting on the shoreline: a man in a dark hat and suit looking out through his telescope, accompanied by a woman wearing a yellow hat with a red ribbon (fig. 13.6). The woman\u2019s dress\u2014perhaps the composition\u2019s brightest element\u2014further captures the viewer\u2019s gaze; in this, one of the few areas of notable impasto in the painting, Monet constructed the garment out of a few strokes of almost pure lead white paint. Upon recognizing the couple\u2014undoubtedly vacationers, given their attire\u2014our view of the painting\u2019s narrative changes. As aptly noted by Robert L. Herbert, \u201cWe are obliged to convert a traditional seacoast scene to one that has been invaded by modern life.\u201d\n\nThe Beach at Sainte-Adresse is often considered to be a pendant to Monet\u2019s Regatta at Sainte-Adresse (fig. 13.7 [W91]), also executed during the summer of 1867 and now in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Although there is no evidence that the artist wanted to exhibit or sell these paintings as a pair, Regatta was painted on a canvas very close in size to the Art Institute\u2019s work, and both depict the same portion of the Sainte-Adresse beach and include signs\u2014notably a new villa atop the hill at left and the presence of vacationers\u2014of the physical and social transformations taking place at the resort destination. Although many scholars have noted the complementary nature of these two paintings and the fact that each picture references the coexistence of local and tourist life at Sainte-Adresse, Beach is dominated by fishermen and dark-sailed ketches, while Regatta is populated with urban tourists and white-sailed leisure yachts. Furthermore, the former has a slightly sketchier paint quality and depicts the water at low tide with an overcast sky; in contrast, the compositional elements of Regatta seem more finished, and it portrays a sunny day at high tide.\n\nRecent technical analysis has revealed, however, that Monet did not always intend for local life to dominate Beach; in fact, there are a number of indications that the Art Institute\u2019s composition was originally closer to that of the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s painting than has been previously recognized. Infrared imaging reveals that in an earlier stage of the Art Institute\u2019s canvas there was a group of four or five figures on the shoreline at the right side of the painting: furthest to the right were a man and woman, to their left were two men (one standing and one possibly seated), and to their left was perhaps another seated figure (fig. 13.8). Although it is difficult to determine the specific details of their clothing, it is clear that they represent a group of city-dwelling vacationers: the woman, located second from the right, wears a long dress, and three of the accompanying figures clearly sport hats, the silhouettes of which resemble those of the tourists in Regatta. Moreover, these figures face the water much the same way that the tourists depicted in the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s picture look out onto the English Channel to watch the regatta. These well-dressed figures were clearly the prominent human element in the original composition and were painted on a scale similar to or slightly larger than the three fishermen at left, which were late additions to Beach. It is notable that traces of charcoal were identified near the heads of these fishermen, suggesting a possible underdrawing and bringing to mind Monet\u2019s graphic works\u2014like Cliffs and Sea, Sainte-Adresse (fig. 13.9, cat. 12)\u2014of the same period.\n\nInfrared imaging and X-radiography of Beach reveal other compositional changes as well. At an earlier stage of the composition Monet included an additional cluster of boats in the water along the right side of the canvas (fig. 13.10). Although subsequently painted out, these earlier crafts had sails that were similar in form and scale to those of the small- and medium-size leisure yachts in Regatta, although none equaled the size of the largest boat in the foreground of the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s painting. More importantly, however, the sails on the earlier boats in Beach were white, indicating that they were pleasure boats, not dark-sailed fishing boats like those that appear in the final composition. By painting out these original white-sailed boats and replacing them with working boats, Monet changed the narrative of the painting from one that foregrounded the leisure class to one that features local life at Sainte-Adresse.\n\nWhen Monet wrote to Bazille in June 1867, he described that \u201camong my seascapes, I\u2019m painting the regattas at Le Havre with lots of people on the beach and the ship lane covered with small sails.\u201d While the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s Regatta fits neatly into this characterization, it has always been difficult to reconcile the subject matter of Beach with Monet\u2019s description, since the painting\u2019s subject has little to do with regattas or the tourist population that gathered to watch them. The presence of vacationers and white-sailed boats in an earlier stage of the painting, however, suggests that Monet began the Art Institute\u2019s picture within the framework that he outlined to Bazille and did not originally intend Beach and Regatta to vary to such a significant degree. It was only at a later stage in his painting process that Monet deliberately complicated the meaning of Beach and, more significantly, the dialogue it shares with the Metropolitan Museum\u2019s picture.  \nGloria Groom and Jill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Monet\u2019s Beach at Sainte-Adresse was painted on a pre-primed linen canvas close in size to a no. 40 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas. There are two ground layers: the lower layer is a light, warm gray, while the upper layer is a warm pinkish-beige. The pinkish-beige tone remains visible at the bottom edges and corners of the painting and in small areas throughout the composition where it is exposed through breaks in the brushwork.\n\nThe beach, water, and sky, along with the central group of boats on the shore and the distant town, were built up simultaneously, with the figures added later. The dark-sailed fishing boats were included in the composition early on. Technical examination has revealed that at one point Monet included four or five figures and a group of sailboats and smaller crafts at the right side of the composition. The artist probably painted out these boats and figures before adding the group of fishermen and boats on the left. He painted these latter elements on top of the mostly finished beach, indicating that they were part of a later painting stage. Other, more minor alterations include the size and position of the three central boats on the beach, the buildings, and the contours of the fishermen.\n\nThe presence of these compositional changes, combined with the fact that much of the painting consists of wet-over-dry paint application, indicates that the work was executed in several sessions. The artist employed a variety of brushwork, including more sweeping strokes in the water and the underpainting of the sky; short, individual strokes of opaque color to build up the beach; and localized passages of thicker, more textural wet-in-wet paint application. Final touches included light strokes, applied with a relatively dry brush, that skip across the high points of the underlying paint texture. Areas of artist\u2019s \u201cretouching\u201d in the water, along the horizon at the right, and around the fishermen were among the final elements to be added to the painting, and they seem to have been used to cover traces of the earlier composition in those areas.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 13.11).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 67 (lower right, name in dark-brown paint, year in reddish-purple paint) (fig. 13.12 and fig. 13.13). The signature and date were applied when the underlying paint was dry. The different colors of paint used for these two elements may indicate that they were added at different times.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original foldover dimensions are approximately 75 \u00d7 101 cm. The closest standard canvas size is no. 40 landscape (paysage) canvas, which measures 73 \u00d7 100 cm.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 19.7V (1.3) \u00d7 22.9H (0.7) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild cusping along the left and right edges, with stronger cusping along the bottom and especially along the top edge. The top edge corresponds to the unprimed outer edge of the larger piece of primed fabric from which this canvas was cut (see Ground application/texture).\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1973, the original dimensions were slightly increased, leaving a border of unpainted ground visible around the edges (see Conservation History). The canvas is currently attached with copper tacks inserted mainly through the lining canvas, outside of the original tacking edges.\n\nOriginal stretching: There are two sets of old tack holes. The holes of one set, probably the original, are spaced approximately 5\u20137 cm apart, which corresponds to the cusping in the canvas. The second set probably relates to the stretching of the canvas after the earlier aqueous lining (see Conservation History).\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered redwood ICA spring stretcher.\n\nOriginal stretcher: The 1973 treatment report notes that the previous stretcher was a \u201c6-piece stretcher with crosspiece\u201d (see Conservation History). Since the painting was lined with an aqueous adhesive at an unknown date prior to 1957, it is uncertain whether the stretcher mentioned in the 1973 report was the original or whether it dated to the aqueous lining. But vertical stretcher-bar cracks near the center of the painting suggest that the original stretcher was five membered, with a vertical crossbar only. The original stretcher depth is unknown.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined, probably glue.\n\nThere are two distinct ground layers (fig. 13.14). Both extend to the edges of the left, bottom, and right tacking margins but stop short of the top edge, where there is approximately 1 cm of unprimed canvas (fig. 13.15). This suggests that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of pre-primed fabric on the left, bottom, and right edges; the top edge probably corresponds to the edge of the larger canvas that was attached to the priming frame. The ground is relatively thick, measuring approximately 20\u2013140 \u00b5m. It fills up the interstices of the canvas weave to some extent.\n\nObserving the painting microscopically, only the upper ground layer is visible. It has a warm pinkish-beige tone, which can be seen in small areas throughout the painting at breaks in the brushwork (fig. 13.16). Cross-sectional analysis shows another layer below the pinkish-beige one that is light gray in color (fig. 13.17).\n\nBoth ground layers contain the same components: lead white, iron oxide red, bone black, silicate minerals, barium sulfate, quartz, and a calcium-based white; the relative proportions of these components vary between the two layers, however, which directly influences their color. The upper pinkish-beige layer contains a higher proportion of iron oxide red, silicate minerals, and barium sulfate, while the lower gray layer has a slightly higher proportion of bone black. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was detected with infrared reflectography (IRR); however, some black particulate material was observed microscopically in a few localized areas. To the left of the heads of the left and middle fishermen, there are a few concentrated areas of black particles deposited on the high points of the primed canvas between the ground and paint layers (fig. 13.18 and fig. 13.19). At the extreme left edge, directly above the boats, are three short lines at varying angles (fig. 13.20), where the black particles appear to be on top of or incorporated into the paint layer (fig. 13.21).\n\nCharcoal.\n\nPossible underdrawing in the area of the fishermen\u2019s heads could have formed part of an earlier outline of the beach, which appears to have been extended farther into the water in this area during painting (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revision). It is unclear what the marks at the left edge are related to.\n\nThe painting was worked up in several stages, with some significant changes made to the composition, particularly on the right side, where the artist originally included a number of figures and boats. The infrared reflectogram (IRR) reveals that an earlier version of the composition included four, or possibly five, figures on the shoreline near the right edge. The IRR clearly shows a trio of standing figures near the bottom-right corner (fig. 13.22): a male figure on the left and a couple on the right. These figures appear to be facing the water and were painted on a scale similar to or slightly larger than the three fishermen in the foreground of the finished painting. Some of the brushwork related to these figures is visible in the X-ray (fig. 13.23). With the use of transmitted infrared, a fourth figure to the left of the standing group comes to light (fig. 13.24). This figure, seemingly a male, appears to be sitting on the beach, and to his left, a similar but more ambiguous form could indicate a seated companion. A few microscopic traces of black paint were observed at the shoreline in the area of the seated male. The black paint appears to lie on top of the greenish-blue paint from the water and underneath the gray strokes of the beach (fig. 13.25). It is possible that the traces of black paint relate to the seated figure and were simply not covered by either the water that was painted over the figures or the later strokes added to the shoreline (fig. 13.26).\n\nAbove the painted-out figures, farther out in the water, several forms indicate that the artist experimented with a variety of boats, including some large sailboats and smaller marine craft. In the X-ray, two large sails are visible near the horizon (fig. 13.27). Within the area of these large sails, three smaller sails, which seem to have been associated with smaller sailboats, are also visible. All of these forms probably contain a significant amount of lead white paint, based on their radio-opacity, especially when compared with the dark-sailed fishing boats in the final composition. At the extreme right edge, there appears to be another large sailboat. This is more difficult to discern in the X-ray, but it is evident in the infrared reflectogram (fig. 13.28). The artist also seems to have initially included some smaller boats without sails near the horizon and one slightly closer to the shore, which appears to carry two passengers. Moving left along the horizon, two more small sails are visible just to the right of the fishing boat from the final painting. On the left side of the fishing boat, among the smokestacks on the distant shore, it appears that the artist originally included a triangular flag (fig. 13.29) and, subsequently, more billowing smoke from the chimneys (fig. 13.30), which was then cursorily obscured with a few strokes of grayish paint (fig. 13.31). Passages of more-solid and slightly \u201cmismatched\u201d paint along the horizon seem to represent areas where the artist worked to cover over the earlier compositional elements. The small vessels were applied wet-on-wet over the blue-gray paint along the horizon (fig. 13.32).\n\nOther, more minor changes include the position and size of the three central boats on the shore. In the X-ray, the front boat appears smaller and is positioned at more of an angle, while the front end of the middle boat was originally slightly shorter (fig. 13.33). The farthest boat appears to have been a later addition, since the beach underneath it is more worked up than in the area of the other two boats. Some modifications are also visible in the buildings on the left side of the composition (fig. 13.34). For example, the large building at the top of the hill was originally in a lower position. To the immediate right, the two brownish-gray buildings, as well as the large house to the right of the spire, appear to have been added at a later stage, as they were painted over the sky, in contrast to the other buildings, which were incorporated into the composition from an early stage, with the sky built up around them. A slight adjustment may also have been made to the spire. The boats and the three fishermen on the left side of the work were all painted on top of the beach, indicating that they were later additions to the painting (fig. 13.35). Brushstrokes related to the beach continue underneath the figures (fig. 13.36). Changes to the figures seem to have involved either minor shifts in position or modifications in size. This is particularly evident around the blue jacket of the left fisherman and the center figure\u2019s left shoulder (fig. 13.37). Around the blue jacket, it is clear that the artist wiped away some of the still-wet blue paint, leaving traces in the recesses of the underlying paint of the beach (fig. 13.38). It seems that the off-white paint of the beach was still soft when the blue paint was wiped away, as the peaks of the brushmarks appear smooth and flattened in the wiped areas. The artist then applied a few strokes of grayish paint, presumably to cover these paint residues (fig. 13.39 and fig. 13.40); this was not done precisely, however, and the paint residues remain clearly visible in places. The shoreline behind the fishermen seems to have been adjusted slightly, the pale-gray paint of the beach having been extended farther into the water (fig. 13.41). The erosion-prevention structures, placed at intervals perpendicular to the distant shore, were originally longer, perhaps suggesting a change in the water level (fig. 13.42).\n\nMost areas of the painting seem to consist of two or three pigments, usually mixed with lead white. Gray and darker-brown areas tend to have more complex pigment mixtures that incorporate earth pigments and black. The warm pinkish-beige tone of the upper ground layer is evident at the corners and edges of the painting, which are less finished than the rest of the composition (fig. 13.43). It also remains visible in small areas through open brushwork\u2014for example, in the distant beach (fig. 13.44). The tone of the exposed ground appears to shift slightly depending on the colors applied adjacent to it. In general, the paint was built up in opaque strokes, with low-relief brushmarks visible across the surface (fig. 13.45). The painting includes both wet-over-dry (fig. 13.46) and localized areas of wet-in-wet paint application (fig. 13.47), but with little actual blending of colors on the canvas. There are some areas of thicker, more textural paint application\u2014for example, in the white strokes of the seated couple (fig. 13.48). The middle fisherman was executed with thick, fluid paint, the strokes of which melded together (fig. 13.49). Several final strokes were applied with a light touch that skipped across the surface of the underlying paint texture. This can be seen in the white and green strokes of the water on the right side, where the artist may have applied these final touches as a way of breaking up the solidity of the paint in places where earlier compositional features were covered (fig. 13.50).\n\nBrushes, including 1\u20132 cm wide, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, bone black, iron oxide reddish brown (burnt sienna), iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, chrome yellow, cobalt blue, viridian, emerald green, vermilion, and red lake.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an even, relatively matte synthetic varnish, which was applied in 1973, after removal of a natural-resin varnish (see Conservation History). Residues of yellowed natural resin are visible in the recesses of the paint texture (particularly under ultraviolet light). It is uncertain when the natural-resin varnish was applied.\n\nThe earliest examination report in the conservation file, which dates to 1957, indicates that the painting was already lined at that time. This is probably the aqueous lining referred to in the 1973 report. The painting is described as having an extremely discolored varnish layer and heavy surface grime. An unsigned note attached to this report indicates that the painting was cleaned in 1957.\n\nIn 1973 discolored surface films and overpaint around the edges of the painting and over the wide-aperture drying cracks in the foreground boats and left-hand figure were removed. The aqueous lining was removed, and the canvas was wax-resin lined. The painting was restretched on a redwood ICA spring stretcher. An isolating varnish of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out, and the final varnish, consisting of a layer of methacrylate resin L-46 and a layer of AYAA, was applied.\n\nThe work is in good condition overall. The canvas is wax-resin lined and is flat and stretched taut on the stretcher. The original tacking margins are present, but the edges have deteriorated and may have been trimmed in places; there are losses in the fabric at the bottom corners. The paint layer is in excellent condition, with only a few tiny paint losses. There is some slight flattening of thicker areas of paint, probably resulting from the lining. Localized abrasion and ground and paint loss are present around all of the original foldovers. There is a general network of light cracks over the paint surface. Stretcher-bar cracks are most visible in the area of the original vertical crossbar and the right stretcher bar. There are localized areas of drying cracks in some of the foreground figures and boats. There are a few small spots of retouching in the sky related to disruptions in the paint, which appear to be impressions made when the paint was still soft. Retouching has been applied to almost the entire perimeter of the painting, over losses at the original foldovers. Residues of discolored natural-resin varnish are visible throughout the paint surface. There are numerous localized areas of wax residue from the lining adhesive scattered throughout the surface of the painting. Fibers from the facing paper and/or cotton swabs are visible microscopically over the surface, as are several tiny accretions. The work has an even, relatively matte synthetic varnish layer.\n\nCurrent frame (1999): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an English (Arnold Wiggins &amp; Sons, London, 1999), Louis XVI Revival, gilt, scotia frame with egg-and-dart ornament, a stepped and beaded frieze, and a beveled sight. The wood is jelutong with compo ornament. The construction is mitered and nailed. The finish is water gilding over red-orange bole on gesso.

Among the numerous photographers documenting the region was Gustave Le Gray, who made a series of photographs there during the summers of 1856 and 1858. Many of Le Gray\u2019s views documented the transformation of the coastline. He was pioneering in his technical skill and creation of atmospheric photographs that presented little or no narrative context. Le Gray\u2019s sea views were acclaimed in London and Paris, and it has been argued that Monet certainly would have known about these photographs, which may have played a role in his (and other Impressionists\u2019) treatment of their subjects and interest in capturing the momentary. See Carole McNamara, \u201cPainting and Photography in Normandy: The Aesthetic of the Instant,\u201d in The Lens of Impressionism: Photography and Painting along the Normandy Coast, 1850\u20131874, exh. cat. (University of Michigan Museum of Art/Hudson Hills, 2009), pp. 15\u201333. Indeed, there is a certain affinity between Le Gray\u2019s photograph The Beach at Sainte-Adresse (fig. 13.2) and Monet\u2019s painting.\n\nMonet to Bazille, June 25, [1867]; quoted in Richard Kendall, ed., Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters, trans.

Herbert pointed out that yachts could be distinguished from fishing boats by the color of their sails: fishing boats typically had brown sails, and yachts, which were more expensive, had white sails. See Robert L. Herbert, Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 292.\n\nMonet to Bazille, June 25, [1867], quoted in Richard Kendall, ed., Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters, trans. Bridget Strevens Romer (Macdonald Orbis, 1989), p. 24; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1, Peintures, 1840\u20131881 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), pp. 423\u201324, letter 33.\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture for the signature (t) contains iron oxide pigments, viridian, and possibly bone black. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_SAdresse\\_33\\_439\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 28, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture for the date (7) contains cobalt blue, vermilion, iron oxide pigments, and viridian. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_SAdresse\\_33\\_439\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 28, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIt is interesting to note the difference in signature styles between this painting and the contemporary Regatta at Sainte-Adresse (1867; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W91]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_439\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Sept. 23, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOriginal dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, in addition to restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out of the canvas over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, The Beach at Sainte-Adresse (W92/1933.439),\u201d July 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including an aqueous lining and a wax-resin lining.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_439\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Sept. 23, 2011; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_SAdresse\\_33\\_439\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 28, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nResearch on the collection of Impressionist paintings at the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and Fondation Corboud in Cologne has detected similar traces of charcoal underdrawing in works by Monet and some of his contemporaries. It is noted that the \u201clines were easy to blow or brush away during the painting process. For this reason, the extent of the sketch (which can often only be demonstrated under a microscope) is in many cases practically imperceptible.\u201d Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), p. 102.\n\nCharcoal was identified by PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_439\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Sept. 23, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn the transmitted-infrared image, the light, which is positioned behind the painting, is blocked at the edges by the stretcher bars, making the couple at the far right difficult to discern.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, bone black, cobalt blue (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); iron oxide (red, yellow, and reddish-brown), chrome yellow, viridian, emerald green, vermilion (XRF, PLM); and red lake (PLM). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_SAdresse\\_33\\_439\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 28, 2009; and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_439\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Sept. 23, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. A significant zinc peak was detected by XRF in one area of the painting: the yellow band of the fishing boat at left. No zinc white was identified by PLM analysis of the same area. The zinc could be due to an additive, such as zinc stearate, included by the paint manufacturer. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_SAdresse\\_33\\_439\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 28, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed.
