The back (reverse) depicts the goddess Juno (or Faustina) standing left between two children; extending right arm over a child and cradling an infant in left.</p>\n<p>Antoninus Pius, living up to his name, portrays himself practicing religious rites by making a sacrifice to the gods. His daughter the empress Faustina the Younger, was paired with an image of Juno who, as the wife of Jupiter, symbolized marriage and family and acted as the divine protector of children. Rome encouraged large families to populate its provinces and fill the army\u2019s ranks. Faustina was the wife of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and mother of his thirteen children.</p>\n",
