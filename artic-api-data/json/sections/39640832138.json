Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897. So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. Gauguin hoped to use the mimeograph machine to print images and text simultaneously (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text of the August, September, and October 1899 issues were rendered partially illegible due to the broken lines and uneven printing. In this and later issues of the journal, he integrated wood-block prints, such as the headpiece, to improve the clarity of his illustrations. In another copy of the November 1899 issue of Le sourire in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) was used as the headpiece.\n\nAn impression of Pig, a Dwarf, Flowers, and Leaves (Kornfeld 60 B) adorns the front page of this issue. The irregularity of the impression appears to be a result of selective adhesion of the ink to the block. An excess of linseed oil is indicated by the reticulated pattern of ink deposition and the strike-through of oil on the verso of the sheet as well as onto the sheet facing it.\n\nThe title block appears twice in this issue, once on the first page within the larger image and again on the last page. On the recto the title block was printed in a thick layer of black ink that contained a significant amount of linseed oil. This is evidenced by some oil strike-through on the verso.\n\nThe text of this issue was printed in brownish-black ink applied through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself was responsible for the grainy appearance of the text (see Technical Overview).\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n397 \u00d7 513 mm (full sheet); 397 \u00d7 256 mm (folded sheet); 24 \u00d7 94 mm (title block), 105 \u00d7 187 mm (headpiece)\n\nThe issue is in fair condition. There are edge tears and small losses in the sheet.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
