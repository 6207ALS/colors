    "description": "<p>An early pioneer of modern architecture and interior design in Southern California, Vienna-trained Rudolph Schindler presented a new, austere aesthetic that became synonymous with the region\u2019s progressive culture. The outspoken doctor and European \u00e9migr\u00e9 Basia Gingold commissioned a series of projects from Schindler between 1937 and 1951, including plywood furniture for her home and office. This unrealized design for Gingold\u2019s new medical office and pharmacy appears to adapt Schindler\u2019s tectonic designs for houses, with a large public entry and porch as well as more private, domestically scaled areas such as a rooftop terrace.</p>\n",
