    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Van Gogh painted this view of the public garden opposite his lodgings in the southern French town of Arles in September 1888. He had arrived in Arles from Paris earlier that year hoping to find new inspiration amid the vibrant colors and brilliant light of Provence. The garden, depicted with thick unblended brushstrokes seems full of the vigorous, almost wild forces of nature. The uncut grass in the foreground gives way to a dense mass of trees and bushes painted in every shade of green imaginable beneath a heat filled yellow green sky. In Provence, Van Gogh passionately wished to establish a utopian artist colony. His rented house in Arles would be its main studio. He hoped that the artist Paul Gauguin, whose work he deeply admired would be the first to join him there. Van Gogh planned to decorate his house with paintings in time for Gauguin\u2019s arrival, and he intended this one for Gauguin bedroom, giving it the title \u201cThe Poet\u2019s Garden.\u201d In a letter to his brother he explained that the painting was meant to evoke the garden of Petrarch, the celebrated early renaissance Italian poet who spent time in Provence. This connection Van Gogh felt should in turn recall Gauguin, the new poet soon to arrive in Arles.</p>\n",
