    "description": "<p>Of all the motifs that preoccupied Monet in his exploration of changing light effects, grain stacks are among the most iconic. He captured them at various times of the year and at different moments of the day. When these works were shown in an 1891 exhibition, they were widely praised by his peers. One critic, Octave Mirbeau, wrote that the works conveyed \u201cthe drama of the earth.\u201d Since Monet rarely made drawings, this sheet may have been a potential illustration for Mirbeau\u2019s article. The softness of the chalk avoids harsh contours and, in turn, better mimics the artist\u2019s painting technique.</p>\n",
