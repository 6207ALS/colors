    "description": "<p><em>Crying</em> is part of a series of photographs in which Collier set up record or magazine covers as sparely constructed still lifes, arranged in a clean setting much like the gallery spaces in which the photographs themselves are most often seen. The record cover shows a closely framed view of a lachrymose Ingrid Bergman, which is taken from the 1943 film adaptation of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s novel For Whom the Bell Tolls, in a 1980s re-pressing of the original soundtrack album. One is simultaneously aware of Bergman\u2019s tear-streaked face as an image of beauty and as a surface of makeup furrowed by a lone trickle of sorrow. The record cover, meanwhile, appears as an iconic movie frame and also a slightly worn object, presumably handled and listened to many times before it came into Collier\u2019s possession.</p>\n",
