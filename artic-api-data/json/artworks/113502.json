Previously assigned to around 1911, it can just as plausibly be credited to the artist\u2019s final years in Europe. In the almost Divisionist application of brushstrokes, creating small building blocks of color that negate spatial recession, it seems to relate to French landscapes dated 1908 that document Marin\u2019s response to Neo-Impressionism. An inscription on the back (\u201cn 2\u201d encircled) has led to its possible identification as Hill and Village, No. 2, Chevreuse from 1909.</p>\n",
