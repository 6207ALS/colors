    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In a darkened room represented with deep melancholy blues a young woman looks out her window into the night. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: What Munch has done with this subject is to create an atmosphere of mystery and even foreboding. Notice how the woman is looking at the window. She\u2019s drawing aside the curtain so that she can see outside, but yet she also seems to be hiding her face with the curtain so that anyone looking from the outside won\u2019t see her. It raises questions in the viewer about why she is behaving as she is, whom is she looking at, whom is she perhaps afraid to be seen by? There\u2019s an indication at the lower right that we\u2019re seeing a round table, but what is happening to the young woman\u2019s right? There\u2019s a pit of blackness and one can almost read forms. So, it\u2019s like reading clouds. One can almost imagine figures or forms there, but one\u2019s not sure if they\u2019re there or whether they\u2019re the project [sic] of the imagination of the viewer who\u2019s looking at them. What Munch is hinting at is the inner life of this young woman so that we\u2019re introduced to this figure, become involved in her story, and yet our desires for a clear narrative are thwarted.</p>\n",
