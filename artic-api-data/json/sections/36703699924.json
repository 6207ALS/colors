Harrison Collection, 1933.889\n\nBiting and amusing by turns\u2014and visually surprising, given the Impressionist touch for which the artist is best known\u2014Monet\u2019s caricatures form an idiosyncratic chapter of his oeuvre. He drew them as a youth and, significantly, they are probably the first works for which he received payment. For many years, art historians and dealers tended to dismiss the drawings, considering them somewhat anecdotal. However, as James A. Ganz and Richard Kendall argue in a recent publication, the caricatures reveal much of the artist\u2019s early interests and ambitions. They are visually engaging and, quite tellingly, help to situate the artist at a particular historical moment.\n\nThe first mention of the caricatures in print appeared in 1883, in an article by the critic, printmaker, and collector Philippe Burty, who wrote positively about Impressionist art. Burty explained how, on leaving school, the young artist tired of helping out in his father\u2019s business. In order to earn money of his own, \u201cMonet drew caricatures with huge heads (like those made fashionable by Daumier\u2019s Representatives Represented) of the regulars at the harbor caf\u00e9s, the brokers and captains of the casual trade. He would supply himself with vellum, pencils, and penknives at Boudin\u2019s stationary store. The owner . . . even framed these caricatures [to sell in his shop], appreciating their allure while finding the drawing technique somewhat insufficient.\u201d\n\nBurty\u2019s allusion to The Representatives Represented was astute. Typically, Daumier had not distorted the features of the figures he depicted to any great extent; but he had given them disproportionately large heads for their bodies (see fig. 1). Quite logically, if Monet awarded his figures a similar physique, he may have hoped for comparable success. In the 1850s, when the young artist made his caricatures, Daumier\u2019s work was popular and accessible.\n\nThat images such as The Representatives Represented circulated readily in the mid-nineteenth century is unsurprising. There were plenty of outlets for satirical art. Cheaper methods of reproduction had led to a proliferation of new periodicals in France. Popular ones\u2014such as L\u2019illustration\u2014printed more than one hundred thousand copies per week. There were journals and magazines for all social classes and political persuasions, and it was typical for a bourgeois family to enjoy such publications. Prompted by material of this kind, the young artist made copies after some of the leading caricaturists of the day (including Nadar, \u00c9tienne Carjat, and Paul Hadol). Concurrently, he made original caricatures, perhaps commissions from the local figures they parody. However, since some authors consider that the copying process constituted an apprenticeship of sorts, it seems logical to address Monet\u2019s drawings that fall into that category first.\n\nIt was Pierre Georgel who first recognized, in 1968, that one of the Art Institute\u2019s caricatures, Auguste Vacquerie (cat. 1 [D505]), was not an original composition but a visual quotation from the ambitious Panth\u00e9on Nadar of 1854 (see fig. 2). This well-known work featured representations of around three hundred figures from French cultural life. Among its line-up were such notables as Honor\u00e9 de Balzac and Alexandre Dumas. On other occasions, most probably around the same time, Monet copied different figures from the Panth\u00e9on. His portrait-charge of the journalist Th\u00e9odore Pelloquet, now in the Mus\u00e9e Marmottan Monet, is one such example (see fig. 3).\n\nThe young artist evidently admired Nadar\u2019s idiosyncratic arrangement of heads\u2014he mimicked the domino-like composition in his Petit Panth\u00e9on th\u00e9\u00e2tral (fig. 4)\u2014but in this particular instance he had motives other than emulation. One of the figures portrayed, Auguste Vacquerie, was a writer from Le Havre who had proven himself a loyal follower of Victor Hugo in the most literal of terms. When Hugo left France to avoid arrest, having criticized Napoleon III, Vacquerie went with him to the Channel Islands. Nonetheless, though physically estranged from France, Vacquerie\u2019s local reputation ensured he remained topical in his hometown. Indeed, Monet had particular cause for interest, as his father had ties with the Vacquerie family. Coupled with the comic appeal of the writer\u2019s features (Vacquerie\u2014by his own admission\u2014had a rather large nose), it is clear he made a particularly compelling subject (see fig. 5).\n\nThis would suggest that, as much as he chose his models for aesthetic reasons, Monet\u2019s selections were personality driven. Nadar had depicted the playwright Mario Uchard (see fig. 6) and even photographed him in later years (see fig. 7); but Monet took his portrait-charge of Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) from a caricature by Carjat. Of course, convenience may have shaped the choice, and Monet could simply have seen the work as it appeared in the right-wing newspaper Le gaulois. But, beyond that, it is possible he appreciated Carjat\u2019s visual description of this controversial character. Uchard had recently satirized his personal life in a play staged at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Fran\u00e7ais; the actress Madeline Brohan (his partner, whom it portrayed in an unflattering light) was absent at the time. In view of his notoriety, then, the caricature\u2019s confrontational stance in the portrait-charge seems entirely appropriate. A monocle draws attention to his unflinching gaze. By choosing an image of a press-worthy literary figure to hone his talent, Monet may well have hoped that his own caricatures might one day find publishers. As it happened, he would have to wait until 1860 before one of his drawings appeared in print.\n\nThe practice of copying caricatures did serve a more pressing purpose in that, most probably, it informed how Monet described physiognomic detail. For instance, the thick fringe that curls around Uchard\u2019s face\u2014made with heavy continuous lines\u2014is similar to that which appears in Caricature of L\u00e9on Manchon, a highly worked original Monet caricature in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (cat. 2 [D481]). In both instances, he placed a blunt line below the lower lip, a shorthand of sorts for shadow.\n\nWhen it came to making original caricatures, as in this instance, Monet probably knew his subjects personally. At Le Havre\u2019s Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Amis des Arts, where he showed his first documented painting, Manchon (see fig. 8) was treasurer. Tellingly, the framed pictures and portrait bust in the background of the image might refer to that context, as they suggest the staging of an exhibition. The signs, however, allude to the sitter\u2019s work as a notary. \u201cGrocer\u2019s shop for sale\u201d reads one; another alludes to his availability for weddings and a range of payment options.\n\nA variant of this composition exists in the collection of the Beaux-Arts in Rouen and indicates how, on occasion, Monet experimented with different versions of the same caricature. It is difficult to tell in this instance which of the drawings came first but, given the higher degree of resolve in the costume of the Rouen figure and the confident white highlights, it seems likely that it developed from the Art Institute version. Nonetheless, it is likely he was pleased with both, since he cared to sign each one.\n\nOf all Monet\u2019s caricatures, copied or original, Caricature of Jules Didier (cat. 10) is the most fanciful. A bearded head, tethered by a female centaur, sits atop a winged insect body; the arrangement is particularly curious. Daniel Wildenstein identified Didier (fig. 9) as its subject. This now-forgotten academic painter won the Prix de Rome in 1857 and apparently specialized in landscape scenes. However, the rationale for the peculiar iconography remains a mystery, and so the issue continues to attract debate. Notably, for instance, Didier\u2019s conventional works\u2014a few of which remain in the collection of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris\u2014shed no light on the peculiar iconography.\n\nThe poster in the background of Caricature of Jules Didier seems to relate to a fair or circus of some kind. It mentions a \u201cCanon-man\u201d and a \u201cButterfly man\u201d: a line-up that, according to one recent reading, might cast the mention of ticket prices in the image (\u201cprix des places\u201d) as a snide reference to Didier\u2019s popular success. Reined in by the classical beast, so the argument follows, the butterfly artist cannot fly free to fulfill his creative potential. However, unless further material comes to light to substantiate Monet\u2019s thoughts on Didier, this thesis will remain speculative.\n\nOther caricatures Monet created at this moment, the identities of the sitters often unrecorded, lack the nuanced detail of those with professional precedents. The lines of Caricature of a Man with a Large Nose (cat. 8 [D492]) are lighter and less decisive than those in the works after Nadar and Carjat, for instance, while the description of the figure\u2019s clothing is relatively vague. The execution of Caricature of a Man in a Small Hat (cat. 3 [D496]) and Caricature of Eug\u00e8ne Marcel (cat. 6 [D491]) also seem relatively casual. The trousers of the former are shaded with rough diagonal pencil strokes; his right hand\u2014which clutches an instrument of some kind\u2014is barely resolved. Perhaps for the sake of speed, in the latter he hid the subject\u2019s hand in the pocket of his coat. In Caricature of a Man Standing by Desk (cat. 7 [D497]), meanwhile, the artist left his revisions of the jacket shape in evidence, and the furniture looks anything but steady.\n\nArguably, with its touches of color, Caricature of a Man with a Big Cigar (cat. 4 [D490]) is the most compelling of the anonymous group. It is more finely detailed than many of Monet\u2019s original compositions and, unusually, makes use of red chalk in areas that include the figure\u2019s ruddy cheeks and the creases of his brow. The lines of the sitter\u2019s suit are sharp and his collar consists of a few clean touches of white. However, if the execution of Caricature of a Man with a Big Cigar is sensitive, the overall effect is comic. The subject has overly long legs. His curved eyelashes border on the feminine.\n\nThe body language Monet described in the last of the Art Institute\u2019s original caricatures, Caricature of Henri Cassinelli (\u201cRufus Croutinelli\u201d) (cat. 9 [D495]) stands in stark contrast to the elegant pose of the figure in Dandy with a Cigar (fig. 10). Here the subject\u2019s entire demeanor is pitiful: from his downcast eyes to his hand in pocket\u2014even his waxed mustache seems to droop despondently. This dejected character was apparently a fellow applicant for municipal funding whom Monet satirized in a portrait-charge. In a play on the word croute, as in \u201cdaub,\u201d he renamed his huddled rival \u201cRufus Croutinelli.\u201d Henri Cassinelli was a bad painter, he implied, whose appearance was as hopeless as his art.\n\nThough Monet used his image to mock Cassinelli\u2019s artistic struggle, this was also a difficult period in his own professional development. At this stage, though his caricatures brought him notoriety, they also proved a hindrance. In response to Monet\u2019s own grant application, the authorities cast doubt on his aptitude for more serious artistic endeavor. \u201cThrough caricature . . . ,\u201d read their report, \u201cMonet has already found the popularity that comes so slowly to serious works. But with his precocious success is there not a danger, that in following the facile path of his pencil the young artist might be kept from the more serious and thankless studies that alone justify municipal liberality? Time will tell.\u201d\n\nClearly, as history has proven, Monet had the last laugh. In later life, with discernable glee, he boasted of his youthful commercial prowess: \u201cAt fifteen, all of Le Havre knew me as a caricaturist . . . the plentiful commissions . . . prompted me to make an audacious decision that, of course, would scandalize my family. I took payment for my portraits. Depending on the look of a person, I\u2019d charge them between ten and twenty francs for their portrait, and the scheme served me marvelously. My clients doubled in a month. I was able to set a fixed price of twenty francs without slowing down orders at all. If I\u2019d have carried on, today I\u2019d be a millionaire.\u201d\n\nQuite reasonably, doubts have been raised as to just how much money Monet could have earned through his efforts; there are evident inconsistencies in the artist\u2019s recollections of his early career, and he tended to exaggerate his talent. Nonetheless, poetic license aside, the caricatures give reliable insight into the artist\u2019s beginnings in Le Havre. The Art Institute\u2019s group\u2014one of the most significant in a single public collection\u2014are representative of their range and complexity.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Caricature of Auguste Vacquerie (D505) corresponds to Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 5, Suppl\u00e9ment aux peintures: Dessins; Pastels; Index (Wildenstein Institute, 1991), p. 148, cat.

This entry is indebted to that chapter.\n\nContradicting some details of Burty\u2019s account, the artist claimed he began to make comical sketches of his teachers on the blue paper of his copybooks. See James A. Ganz and Richard Kendall, The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 11. Interestingly, some of the Art Institute works have blue paper supports, which might suggest that he enjoyed the distinctive properties of the paper: deeply colored, roughly textured, with noticeable (though flattened) fibers.\n\nPhilippe Burty, \u201cThe Landscapes of Claude Monet,\u201d La r\u00e9publique, Mar. 27, 1883, translated in Charles F.
