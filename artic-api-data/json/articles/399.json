But I was especially excited this year to take her through Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity . In the past, we\u2019ve meandered through the Modern Wing and last year\u2019s Lichtenstein exhibition and while Sophie is always game for exploring contemporary art, I knew all of the beautiful dresses and accessories\u2014not to mention the paintings\u2014 in this exhibition would be right up her alley. I was not disappointed. She proclaimed that she found \u201cthe prettiest dress ever\u201d (see above) and \u201cthe coolest shoes\u201d as we walked throughout. She\u2019s a ballerina herself, so she loved the use of tulle and all of the volume in the garments. I didn\u2019t take offense when she noticed that all of the dresses in the exhibition wouldn\u2019t fit me (they wouldn\u2019t), but did feel a little better when she added that they looked like they would be better suited for a big kid. In fact, all of the garments in the exhibition are for adults, but adults during this time were significantly shorter than adults today. She was also quick to notice the different styles of the Impressionist artists. Tissot\u2019s exacting style \u201clooked more like a photo,\u201d while Monet\u2019s paintings were \u201ca little brushier.\u201d And she was right. Although Tissot\u2019s paintings were exhibited at the Parisian Salons, his work is less identified with the Impressionist movement because his aesthetic differed so much from the sketchier brushwork of Renoir, Degas, and, of course, Monet.   She also appreciated the general theatricality of the exhibition. Her favorite gallery featured paintings set out of doors. She was happy she wore sandals so she could feel the grass and was a big fan of both the green park benches and the \u201ccomfy\u201d circular sofas in later galleries in lieu of the standard wooden museum benches. And while I think she did really love the glamour, she came to the (smart, I think) realization that she wouldn\u2019t be interested in living in that time. She noted that a lot of the garments didn\u2019t look particularly easy to wear (especially when you factor in corsets) and that even the dresses women wore just around the house seemed like a lot of work. As always, it was illuminating to look at a familiar subject through a different lens. Thanks, Sophie! \u2014Katie Rahn ",
