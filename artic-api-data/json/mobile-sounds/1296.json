    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: From the twelfth through the sixteenth century the powerful kingdom of Mali extended over a large portion of northern West Africa protected by warriors mounted on horseback. The kingdom\u2019s great wealth and influence grew from its strategic position controlling the northward flow of valuable goods including gold and slaves in exchange for salt, copper and manufactured wares. The mountain man in this group is larger than the rest indicating his superior status. Even today, images of mounted warriors are important symbols of power in modern Mail which draws its name from the ancient kingdom. This group of terracotta figures was probably made between the fourteen and fifteenth centuries. Their fluid sculptural style is called Bancone after a village near Bamako, Mali\u2019s present day capital where similar figures were unearthed. The individuals are clearly wealthy and their rich details of dress offer a fascinating glimpse into Mali\u2019s medieval past. Their hair is carefully styled. Their enormous bracelets would have been made of gold or brass. The mounted warrior wears a pendant at his neck and what are probably bells suspended from his belt. He and the seated warrior to the right wear knives on their upper arms. If you look behind the seated warrior you can see the quiver he wears on his back.
