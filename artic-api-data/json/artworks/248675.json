    "description": "<p>This collage, a portrait of sorts, is grounded by two superimposed silhouettes belonging to Bill Wilson and May Wilson. Ray Johnson met Bill in 1956 and began corresponding with him and his mother, May, later that year. Bill would soon become Johnson\u2019s foremost critic and collector, as well as the artist\u2019s self-appointed archivist, eventually amassing the largest collection of Johnson\u2019s works, including <em>Untitled (Silhouette)</em>. Over the next thirty years, Johnson maintained close ties with Bill and with May, an artist herself. Here, their profiles appear fused and engulfed by Johnson\u2019s cache of recurring motifs, including snakes, bunny heads, and the handwritten name of the poet Marianne Moore. Near the top of the image, Johnson also incorporated his own photographic likeness\u2014upside down, repeated, and enclosed in perforated squares that suggest postage stamps. Though he engaged it obliquely, portraiture was a natural extension of Johnson\u2019s interest in people and a means of weaving an interconnected web of intimate relationships.</p>\n",
