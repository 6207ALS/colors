    "transcript": "<p>JAMES RONDEAU: You have Tropic\u00e1lia on the one hand as this very complex environment and then you have the work of art that really is developed as its mate, called Eden. So this is actually a work that is a second portrait of Brazil but this one made actually from the perspective outside of the nation. He described Tropicalia as a journey, and Eden as a destination.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Like Tropic\u00e1lia, visitors are encouraged to become participants within Eden. Oiticica imagined visitors being able to relax in his artificial environment, reading magazines and books, engaging in a combination of passive leisure and active creativity.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Helio develops a really wonderful word, an invented word, a neologism, where he smashes together two different words: creativity and leisure. And he calls it, \u201ccreleisure.\u201d Creative resting. And there\u2019s some kind of notion here that when you arrive into Eden, you\u2019ve arrived at a place of rest. And that\u2019s also one of most powerful sculptural innovations that we can find in Eden, which are these places called simply \u201cnests,\u201d these rectangular enclosures that are body-sized, that invite you to lie down, to have a solitary, recumbent experience, and to rest. You can replenish yourself, but this idea of a rest that also implies a powerful creativity. So, simply put, while you\u2019re laying back, doing nothing, you\u2019re participating in a creative act.</p>\n",
