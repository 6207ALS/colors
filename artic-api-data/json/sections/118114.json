Ensor\u2019s depiction closely resembles reproductions of the now-armless multibreasted statue of Artemis from the Ephesus Archaeological Museum in Sel\u00e7uk (present-day Turkey; fig. 1) more than it does Gustave Flaubert\u2019s account in his Temptation of Saint Anthony. Rendered in colored pencil over pre-existing drawing, she may be a later addition to the composition. The absence of media along the left edge of the sheet confirms that the figure was drawn across overlapping sheet edges after they had been mounted to the canvas.\n\nThe Greeks venerated Artemis as the \u201cLady of Ephesus.\u201d In a pre-Hellenic cult statute carved in wood and decorated with jewelry, multiple round, breast-like protuberances cover the chest. These have been variously interpreted as breasts, eggs, grapes, acorns, and bull testes\u2014all symbols of fertility. The imagery was appropriated throughout European art, for example, in the famous fountain of Diana at the Villa d\u2019Este near Rome (fig. 2) and in Joseph Werner\u2019s drawing Diana Ephesus as an Allegory of Nature (fig. 3).\n\nThe body and legs of Diana/Artemis are usually represented by a tapering, pillar-like form with protruding feet. On coins minted at Ephesus, the goddess wears a mural crown resembling a city\u2019s walls, an attribute of the mother goddess Cybele. Behind the crown is a disk, a symbol of the full moon, one of Diana\u2019s attributes, and a garland of flowers hangs on her breast like a necklace\u2014a sign of her influence in springtime. Above the crown are figures of maidens, as she is the patron of young girls. Lions cling to her arms, as she is mother of wild beasts.\n\nThe temple of Artemis at Euphesus was rediscovered in 1869 by an expedition led by John Turtle Wood and sponsored by the British Museum. The excavation continued until 1874. Due perhaps to this archaeological discovery and subsequent interest in the temple, prints and engravings of the cult statue were numerous, although mainly copied from ancient Roman sculptures (see fig. 4). Flaubert\u2019s description of Diana is based on a Roman copy of a second-century statue now in the Capitoline Museum in Rome (fig. 5).\n\nThe central bestial figure was created in black colored pencil and possibly charcoal, with Ensor\u2019s characteristic scratching in the face. The figure reappears in Ensor\u2019s collage drawing Hippogriff (fig. 6) and also resembles the creatures that greet Christ in The Devils Dzitts and Hihahox, Commanded by Crazon Riding a Furious Cat, Lead Christ into Hell (fig. 7), suggesting sheets 5B and 5C began as sketches for that drawing. Historical restorations were preserved along the lower half of the right edge. An artist\u2019s patch formerly covered the bottom of the central figure, possibly masking its genitals. SMC/KJN\n\nWhen the critic from the Journal de Bruxelles saw The Temptation for the first time, he exclaimed, \u201cJames Ensor has thrown himself headlong into uncompromising Japonisme\u201d (L.,\u201cVIi\u00e8me Salon des Vingt,\u201d Journal des artistes, March 10, 1889, in Octave Maus\u2019s pressbook, 1889, p. 6, on deposit in the Archives of Contemporary Art, Brussels). The complicated graphic style and compression of space in this sheet reveal that Ensor was inspired by Japanese prints. The monstrous serpent and grimacing monsters that threaten the warrior in Utagawa Kuniyoshi\u2019s Kid\u014d Maru Seated Cross-Legged on a Giant Python (fig. 8) are reminiscent of several of the creatures in The Temptation.\n\nThis same dense graphic style, full of monstrous human-animal hybrids, can be found in the 1886 drawing The Devils Dzitts and Hihahox, Commanded by Crazon Riding a Furious Cat, Lead Christ into Hell (fig. 7). The Japoniste style of the demons and the surrounding space contrasts with the figure of Christ, who appears anachronistically as a Western figure in the highly stylized Japanese setting. The deepest blacks and shadows are created by dense hatching, while highlights are formed by the blank paper, gommage (scrubbing), grattage (scraping), and white gouache.\n\nIn the etching based on this drawing, Ensor\u2019s focus shifted from the murky half-light of hell and associated atmospheric effects to emphasizing Christ and the devils (fig. 9). The etching is brighter and the figures are rendered with greater precision, detail, and specificity. Moreover, Ensor omitted Crazon riding his wild cat.
