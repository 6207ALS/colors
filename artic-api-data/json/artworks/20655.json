    "description": "<p>A self-described \u201cscholar-photographer,\u201d Clarence Kennedy learned photography in the 1920s in order to document the classical sculptures he was studying as a professor of art history. His stated goal was not to interpret the work anew but rather to bring out the character of the sculptor\u2019s forms. In order to make this detail of the hand of Saint John, he employed a large-format camera in the natural light of a Florentine church\u2014all supported on scaffolding that he built himself. Hugh Edwards acquired six photographs by Kennedy and seems to have included them in the exhibition <em>Photography before 1914</em>, to show the influence of early photography on work made in subsequent years.</p>\n",
