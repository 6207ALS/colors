    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Chains of 14k gold wire are woven into short, radiant ringlets that dangle from oxidized sterling silver hoops. Delicate and delightful. Dana Kellin jewelry is best known for its intricate, meticulous wire-wrapping details. The company&rsquo;s technique, while rooted in ancient tradition, has evolved not only into a unique, artistic form itself, but rises to a level of precision that&rsquo;s been honed to near perfection over the course of our 26 year history. The labor intensive, time consuming nature of the process results in a mixture of organic, handmade charm as well as an air of refinement and sophistication. </span></p><p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Size:&nbsp; 1 in.
