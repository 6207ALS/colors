Yurts were originally shelters for nomadic peoples living on the grass-covered high plateau of Central Asia. Circularity is universally associated with the sacred\u2014living in or worshipping in a circle is linked with the sun, the full moon, the cycles of the seasons, life. The fact that several yurts are part of the infrastructure of Lost Valley thus seems appropriate, given the cycles of conflict and transformation undergone by the community since its founding in 1989.\n\nToday a rural community of about twenty adults, Lost Valley seeks to achieve a balance between a strong ecological focus and a commitment to the functional extended family it hopes to be. However, during the year of 1996, several painful transitions began at Lost Valley\u2014many people left, and friction between old and new members was so high that one resident reported being fearful for his own safety. In the midst of this difficult time, Deborah Riverbend came to Lost Valley and gave a workshop in Naka-Ima, or \u201cHere Now.\u201d Ever since, this philosophy and the very phrase \u201cHere-Now\u201d have become an invocation of a way of being that transformed the community.\n\nLost Valley currently offers workshops in Naka-Ima, which it refers to as \u201cThe Heart of Now,\u201d and collectively lives by this principle. Members support one another emotionally, sharing life\u2019s joys and sorrows\u2014and honestly admitting that sometimes it just doesn\u2019t work.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
