    "description": "<p>Over the course of his 70-year career, Thomas Sully painted more than two thousand portraits, including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/96621/dr-joseph-klapp\"><em>Dr. Joseph Klapp</em></a> (1950.1363) and <em>Mrs. Klapp (Anna Milnor)</em>. Sully's portrayal of Philadelphian Anna Milnor Klapp features her Empire-style dress and stand-up collar with flourishing brushstrokes of silver, gray, and white. The fluted, monumental column in the background underscores the period taste for elegance and classical traditions. The companion portrait depicts Joseph Klapp in contemplation, emphasizing his study of medicine. Together, the portraits present an image of a sophisticated couple that celebrates their prosperity, intelligence, and taste.</p>\n",
