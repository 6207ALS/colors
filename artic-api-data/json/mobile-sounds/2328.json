    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: So what you\u2019re seeing is this ceramic is a very symbolic version of a woman but she\u2019s grasping a wolf cub in her hands and she\u2019s also trampling on a full grown wolf, and underneath, it says, \u201cOviri,\u201d which is often translated as savage or wild and is taken from the name of a Tahitian deity. The reddish-brown unglazed clay of the woman\u2019s body contrasts with both the light buff color of her cascading hair and the bluish-brown glaze of the wolves. And here you can see he is playing with both the glossy surface of the glaze and the roughness of the exposed clay. As you walk around the ceramic, you see that her hair is split. It turns into a hollow vase-like entity, so it\u2019s a sculpture but it\u2019s also a kind of a vessel. And for him it had great importance, not only because he used it in water color monotypes and prints as you see in the same area. But it also was the ceramic that he wanted put on his grave.</p>\n<p>ALLISON PERELMAN: And this is the last and largest and most impressive ceramic of Gauguin\u2019s career. Without a kiln in Tahiti, he hadn\u2019t been able to make ceramics, but he returned to the medium once he was back in Paris. He had tried to submit it to an exhibition, but  it was rejected, which caused a scandal among the avant garde. This incredibly personal work, this object that Gauguin identified with and that he felt symbolized him had been refused and so Gauguin, as a man, as an artist, felt spurned by France and decided to leave it behind.</p>\n",
