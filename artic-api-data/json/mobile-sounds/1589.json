    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The German artist Max Beckmann painted this reclining nude in Paris in 1929. Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern Art Stephanie D'Alessandro.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: Beckmann was associated with a style known as \u201cNew Objectivity\u201d and it came as a kind of reaction from World War I, the idea of looking at society in a kind of biting way, painting in a more realistic style that I think a picture like this beautiful reclining nude demonstrates some of that style of New Objectivity, Beckmann seems to be exploring her in a scientific way. What\u2019s amazing about this picture is also the way that Beckmann paints it. There\u2019s a real love of material, the way that heavy paint falls on the thigh, for example, where you can see it pooled up on just above her knee and I think some of his great love of paint and his enjoyment of painting really comes from his time that he spends in Paris looking at artists who he may have rebuffed earlier, especially Matisse, who he sees as a kind of rival. He allows himself to find the pleasure that other artists in Paris would at this time with pure painting, enjoying experimenting with what paint can do on a surface.</p>\n",
