    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: For James McNeill Whistler, the title of a painting really mattered.<br>Sarah Kelly:  You'll notice that Whistler titled this portrait, &quot;Arrangement in Flesh Color and Brown,&quot; and only then has the subtitle, &quot;Portrait of Arthur Jerome Eddy.&quot; He wanted to emphasize that it was simply a chosen arrangement of line and of color, rather than Arthur Jerome Eddy. And Eddy was very much agreeable to this.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Sarah Kelly, Associate Curator at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY:  Arthur Jerome Eddy is a very important person to the Art Institute of Chicago. He was a Chicago lawyer, and he saw Whistler's works at the 1893 World's Columbian Exhibition here in Chicago, where Whistler actually was given center stage. And he was so impressed that he went off and asked Whistler to paint his portrait. He then went from championing Whistler to championing modern art. He became a very influential collector of modern paintings, so the core collection of German expressionist painting came from Arthur Jerome Eddy. He also published a book about modern art. So he was very influential in promoting modern art in America, and particularly in Chicago.</p>\n",
