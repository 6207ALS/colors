    "description": "<p>The front (obverse) of this coin depicts a quadriga (four-horse chariot) to the right driven by a youthful charioteer with a sun-disc with 5 rays. The back (reverse) depicts the god Zeus Ammon with a horn, standing to the left, holding a patera (dish) over a thymiaterion, with 5 patela.</p>\n<p>This coin shows the deity Zeus Amon, a combination of the Greek god Zeus and the Egyptian god Amun. He holds a scepter while pouring an offering from a patera, a plate used for offerings of olive oil or wine. The god can be identified by the diadem of rams\u2019 horns, the traditional crown of Amon, the creator-deity of Egypt. Amon was no stranger to the Greeks. As early as the 5th century BCE, there was a temple on the Greek mainland built for his worship.</p>\n",
