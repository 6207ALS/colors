The pooling of ink suggests that it was pulled from a glass plate before it was enhanced.\n\nHere two women are clearly in a dialogue. One, with her arms crossed high across her bust, looks back at the other, who extends her left arm and touches her cheek with her right hand. The woman at the left wears a full-length, missionary-style dress, while her companion is wrapped at the waist by a pareu. Both appear with halos. The motif appears occurs in two other watercolor monotypes (fig. 69.2 [Field 1973 16] and fig. 69.3 [Field 1973 17]), as well as in a pen-and-wash drawing (fig. 69.4).\n\nWhen John Rewald published this sheet, he noted that the decorative background seems influenced by the art of Odilon Redon, and he dated it to \u201c1894?\u201d Although what works by Redon Gauguin may have seen before returning to Polynesia cannot be determined precisely, the attenuated female figures in profile are comparable to those in one of the older artist\u2019s noirs (fig. 69.5), and the aureole-like shape around the figures can be found in such works by him as the pastel-over-charcoal Sita, dated circa 1893 (fig. 69.6). Reliefs at the Buddhist temple site Borobudur in central Java, of which Gauguin had two photographs, might also have influenced the women he included in this monotype.\n\nRichard S. Field noted that a similar pair of figures appears in Gauguin\u2019s later wood relief Peace and War (fig. 69.7 [Gray 128]) as the embodiment of peace.  \nSuzanne Folds McCullagh\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Maurice Exsteens (1887\u20131962), Paris.\n\nSold by Galerie les Tourettes, Basel, to Knoedler and Company, New York, Mar. 1955.\n\nSold by Knoedler and Company., New York, to Rufus Crosby Kemper Jr. (1927\u20132014), Oct. 11, 1957.\n\nTo his first wife, Cynthia Warrick Kemper (died 1987) by 1973.\n\nThe estate of Cynthia Warrick Kemper, by 1987.\n\nSold from the estate of Cynthia Warrick Kemper, New York, at Christie\u2019s, New York, to Alice Adam Ltd., Chicago, for Edward McCormick Blair (1915\u20132010), Chicago, May 10, 1988, lot 173.\n\nGiven by Edward McCormick Blair to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Philadelphia Museum of Art, Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, Mar. 23\u2013May 13, 1973, cat. 18 (ill.).\n\nWashington, D.C., National Gallery of Art, The Art of Paul Gauguin, May 1\u2013July 31, 1988, cat. 196 (ill.); Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 17\u2013Dec. 11, 1988; Paris, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Jan. 10\u2013Apr. 20, 1989 (Washington, D.C., only).\n\nBar Harbor, Maine, Ethel H.
