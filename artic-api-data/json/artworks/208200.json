Caillebotte\u2019s \u201clost years\u201d coincide with the use of this sketchbook.</p>\n<p>The subjects of the drawings in the book\u2014panoramic views, portraits, intimate garden scenes, details of trees and architecture, and copies after other works\u2014reflect Caillebotte\u2019s shift away from his earlier depictions of urban Parisians. None are studies for later works; instead this sketchbook is more experimental, as Caillebotte focused on developing his use of watercolor and drawing out of doors.</p>\n",
