Harrison Collection, 1933.890\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet created Man with a Big Cigar using black and red chalk, with touches of white, pink, peach, yellow ocher, and dark-brown chalks on a slightly textured, blue wove paper that has discolored to blue-gray. The paper color provides a middle tone for the composition, with touches of white chalk used to create the man\u2019s shirt and highlights on his shoes. It appears that the artist worked out the figure first with light, quick strokes of black chalk, followed by darker, broader lines to more fully establish the body. In this work, Monet experiments with color in the face of the figure. Various colors of pastel were used to carefully model the man\u2019s face and to create passages of tone in his face and hair. Shadows were established in the figure\u2019s body and hat using dark, thick strokes of black chalk.\n\nO.M. (recto, lower left corner, in black chalk).\n\nBlue-gray, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nNonuniform with many wood and fiber inclusions. Under magnification the fibers appear to be an amalgamation of dark-and light-blue fibers.\n\nEven.\n\n598 \u00d7 385 mm\n\nCream, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper (estimated).\n\nBlue, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using the tip of the black chalk to softly establish the outline and the form of the figure. Rather than developing the figure\u2019s head in black chalk, the artist used various colored chalks (red, white, pink, peach, yellow ocher, and dark brown) to define the facial features. This is most clearly seen along the nose and ears of the subject, which lack a black chalk outline. The tip or edge of the colored chalks were used to draw diagonal strokes that give tonal effects. White chalk rendering the cigar smoke is visible under UV illumination.\n\nThe man\u2019s body is executed with the tip or edge of the black chalk. Faint, gestural lines were used to create the initial form, over which darker, broader strokes were drawn. The pant legs are shaded in overall using the side of the chalk and do not have dark, broad outlines; dark strokes of the chalk were reserved to create shadows. The chair is faintly sketched in with dark strokes along the legs and back. The artist used touches of white chalk to highlight areas such as the figure\u2019s collar, shirt, and shoes.\n\nThe composition was drawn directly onto the paper support. There is minor reworking along the back of the head. This area appears to have a faint amount of smudged black chalk embedded in the paper fibers, as seen under magnification, and the outline was brought nearer to the neck and jaw.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. The paper has faded overall; it was once much bluer as evidenced by the large blue spot to the left of the sitter\u2019s chest. There are a few golden-brown foxing spots throughout. There are no tears or losses noted. The sheet has several horizontal tightly repeating undulations along the left edge. There is a horizontal line running along the width of the sheet located 238 mm from the top edge. There is a small horizontal line, 139 mm long, just above the horizontal line that runs the width of the sheet. Folds or creases from the secondary or tertiary supports may have caused these two horizontal lines to be visible in the primary support.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector, Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the estate documents for Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). As a result of this research, it is possible that this drawing, in addition to a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, were once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, <emem>Claude Monet, vol. 5.</emem>\n\nAccording to Carter H.
