On the back (reverse) is a charioteer with a winged Nike flying above  to crown horses with a wreath.</p>\n<p>To escape the unwanted attentions of the river god Alpheus, the nymph Arethusa swam under the sea to the island of Sicily, where she found sanctuary. Arethusa\u2019s path was said to explain the freshwater spring that miraculously bubbled into the nymph\u2019s pool and that still exists in Syracuse. When this coin was issued, Syracuse was one of the most powerful cities in the Mediterranean basin. Local civic pride was emboldened by a series of ambitious tyrants, who enlarged the city\u2019s territory and also encouraged the arts.</p>\n",
