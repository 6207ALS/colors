    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Paul de Lamerie was one of the most talented and prolific silversmiths working in England in the first half of the eighteenth century. He made this ornate two handled covered cup in about 1740 when the rococo style was reaching the height of its popularity in England. Look at the cup\u2019s handles. Each one made from a series of extravagantly curved serpentine forms. These forms are inspired by those seen in nature such as leaves and shells. In fact, the name rococo comes from the French rocaille which describe the rocks and shells that ornamented grottos in fashionably landscaped gardens. Halfway up the cup is a frieze of grinning heads representing followers of Bacchus, god of wine. They refer to the cup\u2019s original purpose. Large two handled cups were traditionally used as communal drinking vessels. The two handles served to facilitate passing the heavy wine filled cup from person to person. They were a staple of all male societies such as colleges, clubs, and guild or trade associations. Later in the eighteenth century these commemorative presentation objects began to be used as sporting prizes.</p>\n",
