Bottles on a silver tray, fluted wine glasses, and a compote of fruit have been offered for their enjoyment on a brilliant white tablecloth. Judging from the bustle of boating traffic in the background, this is only one of many such groups that took to the waters of the Seine on a summer day, but Renoir transformed this commonplace scene into an idyllic episode of sensuality and pleasure. Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise was sold to Potter Palmer by Durand-Ruel, New York, on April 9, 1892, with the title D\u00e9jeuner de canotiers, just weeks before the May 1 opening of Renoir\u2019s retrospective at the Durand-Ruel in Paris, which included the renowned scene of a boating luncheon along the Seine painted between 1880 and 1881, now in the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. (fig. 2.1 [Daulte 379; Dauberville 224]). In the catalogue that accompanied the retrospective, the Washington work was given the erroneous title D\u00e9jeuner \u00e0 Bougival. Both the Chicago and Washington paintings, however, are set in the restaurant of the Maison Fournaise (fig. 2.2), located on what was then known as the \u00cele du Chiard in the Seine, part of the municipality of Chatou, about one mile farther upriver and north of Bougival. The relationship of subject and site that the two paintings share determined for decades the dating of Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise to 1879. The earlier date of 1875 came to light in 1986, when the Chicago work was identified as that included in the second Impressionist exhibition held in April 1876. An astute connection was made between the catalogue title D\u00e9jeuner chez Fournaise and the snide though accurate description of it as \u201cTonnelle des Canotiers sans jambes\u201d by the critic of Le soleil.\n\nWith the new dating, Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise can be placed with a group of paintings thought to be executed during Renoir\u2019s extended stay at the Maison Fournaise in the summer of 1875, which opened an important chapter in his portrayal of boating along the Seine. The other paintings include an interior luncheon or breakfast (fig. 2.3); at least two landscapes, one of a rowing subject (fig. 2.4 [Dauberville 141]) and another showing the nearby bridge at Chatou (Dauberville 136); and portraits of the proprietor of the restaurant, Alphonse Fournaise (fig. 2.5) and his daughter Alphonsine, both of which are dated and share the loose, flowing brushwork that characterizes Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise. Why Renoir was drawn to the Maison Fournaise in the summer of 1875 remains a mystery, as he was no doubt aware of its local fame as a destination for boat rental before that time. His parents lived in Louveciennes just downriver, near Bougival, and he had been painting in the area since the mid-1860s, most significantly in the summer of 1869 at La Grenouill\u00e8re on the \u00cele de Croissy, where he and Claude Monet completed plein air sketches of visitors and moored boats at the popular restaurant and bathing establishment in preparation for the Salon of 1870. Renoir\u2019s interest in the Fournaise establishment came to an end as abruptly as it began. After 1881 he produced no further paintings with Chatou subjects, and his letter to Th\u00e9odore Duret on Easter Monday of that year, during the execution of Two Sisters (On the Terrace) (cat. 11), was written during his last recorded stay in the town. The restaurant and hotel would continue to thrive for many years, gaining celebrity in a short story by Guy de Maupassant as the Restaurant Grillon, a \u201cstronghold of canotiers.\u201d\n\nRenoir\u2019s earliest depictions of leisure boating date to the 1860s and recall the paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Boudin and Gustave Courbet. In addition to peopling the landscape views of La Grenouill\u00e8re in 1869 mentioned above, boaters continued to appear elliptically in such works as La promenade (fig. 2.6 [Daulte 55; Dauberville 257]), in which the male protagonist wears a boater\u2019s straw hat decorated with red ribbon, and Bather with a Griffon Dog (fig. 2.7 [Daulte 54; Dauberville 596]), a classically posed scene of modern life that Renoir exhibited at the Salon of 1870, depicting two women who arrived at their secluded bathing spot by rowboat. Renoir also took a personal interest in rowing, boating, and regattas, a passion he shared with his Impressionist colleagues. In July 1865 he sailed down the Seine with Alfred Sisley\u2019s brother, Henri, and a model from \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s studio to see the regattas at Le Havre, taking his paint box to make sketches along the way. Renoir wrote enthusiastically to his friend the artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille to join them in the adventure.\n\nRenoir\u2019s work alongside Monet on the shores of the Seine at Argenteuil during the summer of 1874 apparently rekindled his interest in depicting leisure life along the river and boating subjects. On July 22 Renoir and Monet were joined by Manet, who was summering across the river at Petit-Gennevilliers and also painted a number of pictures of boaters that summer. Manet sent one of these, an explicitly Impressionist work with a bright palette depicting a boater and his female companion sitting by the docks, titled Argenteuil (Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts, Tournai), to the Salon in May 1875. It received a lukewarm reception and was caricatured several times in the satiric journal Charivari. One caricature claimed that the pair of boaters had clearly run aground.\n\nThus Renoir\u2019s decision to paint at the Restaurant Fournaise in the summer of 1875 was likely informed by his experience the previous summer on the banks of the Seine at Argenteuil and by Manet\u2019s recent attempt to bring Impressionism to the Salon with a boating theme. The question for Renoir was how to make the theme his own: how to break free of Monet\u2019s predominantly landscape example, how to be a figure painter and create a genre scene based in reality but open to broader readings of idyllic leisure. At Fournaise he found ideal subject matter and willing models. Fournaise was a family-run establishment with a long history in the community that attracted a serious sporting clientele, artists, and members of the Parisian theater world, as well as the odd aristocrat seeking the outdoor experience (who was invariably out of place). Its Parisian equivalent was the Moulin de la Galette, the Montmartre dance hall. As Renoir\u2019s close friend and biographer Georges Rivi\u00e8re later commented, \u201cThe exuberant rowers and the grisettes who accompanied them resembled the young folk and dancers of Moulin de la Galette; the infectious gaiety of this carefree crowd, boastful without arrogance and mocking without malice, attracted the painter, for whom the spectacle of popular enjoyments had always been of interest.\u201d\n\nThe subjects of boating and dancing shared an association with youthful bohemia and student life during the July Monarchy and inspired many treatments in popular culture, such as vaudeville theater, as early as 1845 (fig. 2.8). Before the expansion of the city during the Second Empire and the extension of the railway in the 1840s and 1850s, Parisians boated for pleasure at Bercy, on the east side of Paris near the current location of the finance ministry (fig. 2.9). Boating at Chatou became popular after the area was made accessible by rail and the land was acquired for commercial development by boatbuilder Alphonse Fournaise in 1857. The terrace upon which Renoir\u2019s models sit for the Washington Luncheon of the Boating Party dates from 1867, when a Neoclassical, two-story, red-brick structure was constructed as a restaurant, a function it still serves today. Judging from the point of view of the Chicago Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise, the tonnelles or arbors were on the first floor under this terrace.\n\nAs with many of Renoir\u2019s genre paintings inspired by popular pastimes, the models for Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise were drawn from his immediate circle of acquaintances and may very well have been habitu\u00e9s of the place in which they are shown. The sunburned figure in the white shirt on the right has never been identified but may have been inspired by Renoir\u2019s younger brother, the journalist Edmond Renoir, who served frequently as a model for his brother during the 1870s (fig. 2.10 [Daulte 319; Dauberville 554]). In a series of articles promoting the leisurely pleasures of Bougival and its environs, written for La vie moderne in 1883, Edmond wrote perceptively of boating on the Seine and insisted on extending his survey to Chatou and the Restaurant Fournaise because it reflected the \u201csame world, same joviality, same insouciance.\u201d The fact that the figure is sunburned suggests an intentional light mockery of the city dilettante who has forgotten his hat\u2014license that one would expect a sibling of the modern family to take.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Daulte first identified the figure on the left with the distinctive fan beard as \u201cMonsieur de Lauradour,\u201d a regular at La Grenouill\u00e8re and the Restaurant Fournaise. This model appears in three closely dated Renoir paintings, including a bust portrait (The Rower of Bougival, c. 1876; Kunstmuseum Basel) in the same stipple technique used by the artist in Alfred Sisley (1876; cat. 4). Although the nature of their relationship is unclear, Renoir must have been on friendly terms with Lauradour, as at this time he rarely painted portraits of men he did not know. The third painting in which Lauradour appears is the Luncheon in the Barnes Collection (fig. 2.3), which is almost certainly an indoor scene set at the Restaurant Fournaise during a cooler time of day, as the woman in the picture wears the same blue dress, but under a white jacket.\n\nThat Renoir used the same two models for a complementary theme raises the question of whether the Barnes Luncheon and Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise were conceived as pendants. Luncheon of the Boating Party is slightly smaller but shares a horizontal format. Significant changes to the number and position of the figures in Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise suggest that Renoir may have originally intended to include only two people, a male and a female, as in the Barnes Luncheon. Visible in the X-ray (fig. 2.11) is what seems to be the outline of a figure in profile; the shape of the head suggests a woman with her hair pulled up off her neck. Renoir was able to accommodate a second male with his final placement of the female closer to the center of the painting. He thus established a pyramidal arrangement with the woman resting her elbow on the table and the relaxed, smoking oarsman on the right. The pose of the seated figures, together with the perspectival lines of the table, acts to carry the eye diagonally toward a sun-filled river playground, resulting in a superbly balanced composition.\n\nThe comparison of Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise with contemporary caricature reveals that Renoir followed up-to-date trends in sport fashion. Both male models may be identified as rowers by their white costume and the rowboats seen on the river through the trellis. A woman in a skiff near the shoreline wears a blue flannel dress that matches the one worn by the female figure seated at the table. In J. Pelcoq\u2019s satiric image of boaters modeling their clothes for the Journal amusant in 1875, a number of male and female costumes for nautical outings are displayed, such as the collarless shirt with buttons and the sleeveless shirt for men, and the half-length jacket for women (fig. 2.12). A more distinguished \u201coutdoor gentleman\u2019s\u201d look \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019anglaise,\u201d as suggested by the caption, is modeled by the man wearing a dark jacket, wide-collared shirt with lavaliere, and visored cap. Around his waist this figure sports what appears to be a sash. In Renoir\u2019s painting, Lauradour is portrayed in a combination of these fashions, including the collarless shirt, white jacket, and blue sash. Renoir\u2019s bust portrait of Lauradour shows him to be as meticulous about the stylish trim of his moustache and beard as any of the sportsmen in Pelcoq\u2019s illustration. It is worth noting that on the bank to the right of this scene of boaters sits a woman dressed in a jacket and pants\u2014an outfit that would better accommodate outdoor physical activity.\n\nIn this relatively small canvas\u2014a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas turned horizontally to become a landscape format\u2014Renoir indulged his predilection for pure color. In a remarkably audacious move for the mid-1870s, the artist limited his palette to emphasize the primary colors (see Technical Report). Most distinctive in this regard is the contrasting treatment of the two male boaters. The folds and shadows in the shirt of the smoking figure on the right are rendered in cool blue tones, whereas the trim of Lauradour\u2019s jacket and shirt is entirely yellow. The hair color of the two men is consistent with this yellow/blue color distinction (fig. 2.13). Yellow highlights are found throughout the painting, from the tablecloth and glassware to the flowers, the tree by the water, and the opposite shoreline. Generous application of lead white paint in the men\u2019s shirts, the tablecloth, and the surface of the river behind them contributes to the striking luminosity of the scene (see Palette in the Technical Report). The brushwork of the shirt on the right (fig. 2.14) can be compared to that of the white shirt in the portrait of Alphonse Fournaise (fig. 2.5), in which a flat brush was used to apply the paint and model the folds of the sleeves. In this bold display of color, the blue of the woman\u2019s dress acts as a neutral tone to anchor the composition, while yellow and white encourage movement of the eye over the picture plane.\n\nThe abrupt vertical of the trellis, with its flowering vine, divides interior from exterior, relaxation from physical activity\u2014especially the focused task of navigating a boat. The riverscape in the background here functions to keep the active life of water sports at a distance from the main action of a contemplative smoke and casual conversation over an outdoor meal during summer. What we see in the considered composition and execution of Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise, though based in observed reality of a popular nineteenth-century pastime, has more to do with memory and ideals, with a peaceful utopian existence as envisioned by the artist. Robert Herbert has noted that Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise \u201chas the air of a fable,\u201d while Richard Brettell has likened it to the f\u00eates galantes of Jean-Antoine Watteau. This is not the place to address the degree to which eighteenth-century art influenced Renoir\u2019s development of the modern genre subject, with its youthful cast of characters in quiet conversation, whose mundane moment of leisure has been infused with a decided sensuality. But Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise suggests a renewed appreciation of the art of the ancien r\u00e9gime and a revisiting of the pastoral tradition through the eyes of an indefatigable colorist.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir\u2019s Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise (The Rowers\u2019 Lunch) was painted in several wet-in-wet campaigns and shows evidence of a number of compositional changes. The artist began with a commercially primed, no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas turned on its side, onto which he probably added a selective preparatory layer covering specific parts of the compositional area. This selective layer has a warmer hue and probably contains added oil medium, which allowed for minimum absorption of subsequent paint layers and provided a warm background off of which Renoir could play the cool colors of the background and water.\n\nThere are significant compositional changes in the left half of the composition. X-ray and raking-light images suggest that, in an earlier version of the painting, there was a figure situated in the space between the two individuals who appear on the left in the final composition. Summary underdrawing lines in a dry medium may be related to this figure\u2019s head; additional lines seem to indicate the left side of the trellis opening and the outer curve of the far-left visible figure\u2019s leg, but the nature of these lines is rather intermittent and haphazard. The left side of the original composition seems to have featured only this single figure painted in profile. Heavy brushwork under the far-left visible figure suggests additional changes before the artist executed the forward-facing male figure.\n\nThere are also some minor and partially developed alterations to the right side of the canvas. In the X-ray, a curvilinear form beginning just to the right of the figure and continuing through the torso and a second form just below it may suggest elements of the back of a chair. As these elements were abandoned in their early stages, it is unclear how this placement would have affected the posture of the male figure.\n\nRenoir used a limited palette, and many of the hues were mixed on the surface of the painting. Instead of carefully blending mixtures before dabbing them onto the surface, the artist appears to have dipped his brush in two or more colors and applied them directly to the canvas, where they exist almost side by side; in other areas, he applied a new color into a still-wet stroke to create this effect. The structure of the paint layers suggests that the painting was probably executed in a limited number of sessions, with each wet-in-wet layer allowed to dry before the next layer was applied. The brushwork ranges from heavily blended and smooth to thick impasto, and the heaviest texture appears primarily in the bottom half of the composition. Various small daubs and details, including the highlights on the bottles in the foreground and the small flowers above the figures\u2019 heads, seem to be the final steps of the process.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 2.15).\n\nSigned: Renoir. (lower left, in warm-black paint) (fig. 2.16, fig. 2.17).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were approximately 54 \u00d7 64.7 cm, according to 1971 pretreatment measurements. This probably corresponds to a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size (65 \u00d7 54 cm) canvas, turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.0V (0.9) \u00d7 23.9H (0.8) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas has very mild cusping around the edges, especially on the left, corresponding to the placement of the original tacks.\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1971, the original dimensions were slightly increased on all sides (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed 5\u20136 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.6 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with vertical crossbar. Depth: Approximately 1.8 cm (fig. 2.18).\n\nStamp  \nLocation: original canvas (covered by lining)  \nMethod: stamp  \nContent: M\\_DEFORGE CARPENTIER S<sup>r</sup> / COULEURS FINES / ET TOILES [\u00e1] PEINDRE / 6 Rue Halevy 6 / PARIS / [. . .] Rue Legendre, 62 [. . .] (fig. 2.19; fig. 2.20)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe canvas was prepared with commercially applied priming that extends to the edges of the tacking margins. This commercial priming appears to be a single layer, is rather thin and porous (measuring approximately 5\u201360 \u00b5m), and does not completely fill the weave (fig. 2.21).\n\nRenoir appears to have added a selective preparatory layer to parts of the canvas, especially visible in the top half of the composition. This selective layer is thicker, smoother, and more medium-rich than the commercial ground; it leaves some of the canvas texture visible. The outer perimeter of this layer has a soft edge, suggesting that it was applied with a brush; however, the overall texture of this layer is very smooth with no discernible brushstrokes (fig. 2.22).\n\nThe color of the commercially applied ground appears to be off-white, but it is difficult to determine. While from the surface there is no microscopic evidence of additional pigment particles in this layer, analysis indicates the presence of a small amount of an iron-containing pigment, such as iron oxide red or yellow. This commercial layer is slightly porous and has darkened due to the combined effects of accumulated grime and the saturation of the wax-resin lining material (see Condition Summary and Conservation History). Because of this discoloration, it is difficult to determine what effect this limited amount of colored pigment might have had on the overall tone of this layer.\n\nThe selective preparatory layer is slightly tinted to appear warm beige, and dark particles are visible in it under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 2.23). In some areas, largely in the upper portions of the background, this layer was left exposed by the artist to provide a warm contrast to the cool tones of the river (fig. 2.24).\n\nThe commercial ground is predominantly lead white with a significant amount of barium sulfate. There are also small amounts of iron oxide red or yellow, iron-containing aluminosilicates, silica, calcium-based whites, and trace amounts of bone black.\n\nThe selective preparatory layer is also predominantly lead white with iron oxide red or yellow and barium- and calcium-containing compounds. Stereomicroscopic examination of this layer suggests the presence of black or dark-brown particles. The binder for both layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nInfrared examination reveals very summary contour outlines that may relate to compositional elements in the left half of the painting, including the possible outline of a head (visible in the X-ray) located between the two visible figures (see Paint Layer and Technical Summary); the continuation of the vertical line that forms the left side of the trellis opening; and a faint, curved line near the bottom left corner that relates to the outer contour of the far-left visible figure\u2019s leg (fig. 2.25).\n\nDry media (chalk or charcoal?) (fig. 2.26).\n\nNo compositional changes noted in drawing stage; see Paint Layer.\n\nIt seems that Renoir began this composition with the figures, bringing up the background colors around them after they were painted and also after any major compositional changes. This is especially evident in the female figure, which was painted in relatively radio transparent pigments easily penetrated by the X-ray. X-radiography also indicates that landscape elements do not pass under the female figure\u2019s head, and brushstrokes come up to and abruptly end around the figures, creating a kind of halo effect (fig. 2.27). The table in the center seems to be one of the earliest compositional elements, with the figures and much of the background brought in around it.\n\nThere is evidence that the artist made significant changes to this composition. Thick, directional brushwork visible in the lower left of the canvas does not match the final composition, suggesting that there are possible pentimenti in this area (fig. 2.28); these changes are clearer in raking light and X-radiography. The X-ray documents what appears to be a profile and head (perhaps corresponding with some of the underdrawing lines) situated between the two visible figures in the left half of the composition (fig. 2.29). The right arm of the figure in profile appears to extend to the table, along a line similar to that of the visible female figure. The thickness of the added paint layers in this area obscures the original colors of the underlying composition, making a clear identification difficult. Cross-sectional analysis in this area indicates that the lower part of the original figure\u2019s costume was a light bluish-white, with areas of reddish and purple highlights, similar in tone to the clothing of the figure on the right side of the painting, but with greater impasto (fig. 2.30). The composition appears to have featured only two figures in this early stage: one on the right and one on the left (in profile). Examination of the left side of the painting in raking light calls attention to a ridge of paint that echoes the curved line of this figure\u2019s back (though it is farther to the left). This may indicate movement of the original figure farther to the left or an adjustment to the position of the visible figure on the far left. Examination in raking light also suggests that Renoir painted out original compositional choices on the far left in thick, short, diagonal brushstrokes before he executed the almost forward-facing head of the figure in the final composition (fig. 2.31). The bulk of this original figure, however, does not appear to have been painted out, but merely covered in the process of executing the two visible figures.\n\nExamination in raking light and X-radiography suggest that elements on the right side of the canvas may also have been altered. A horizontal, curvilinear form beginning just to the right of the figure and passing in front of his torso, with a smaller, horizontal element below it, suggests a change in the position of the chair. It is unclear how the placement of the chair would have affected the posture of the figure, and these elements appear to have been abandoned in their early stages (fig. 2.32). In natural light as well as in the X-ray, it appears that the angle of the right arm of this figure was also changed. The elbow was raised and the forearm made narrower in the final paint layers; however, the original position of the elbow is still visible on the surface (fig. 2.33). The exact placement of the figure\u2019s left arm and hand also appear to have been slightly adjusted. Downward directional strokes through the torso as well as the thick strokes of background and underpainting across and around the head may hint at further changes to this figure\u2019s posture.\n\nIn the top half of the composition, the background, the initial layers of the water, and the shoreline were painted first. The outline of the trellis opening was established next, followed by the boats and rowers, and finally the trellis and climbing foliage; each layer was allowed to dry before the subsequent elements were executed. Renoir developed the water with heavy, textured brushstrokes and added color throughout the process (generally before the trellis lattice and climbing foliage) (fig. 2.34); however, the initial layers seem relatively thin in most areas, passing under various compositional elements in the top half.\n\nOverall, the paint was largely applied wet-in-wet over a few campaigns, and each layer was allowed to dry between sessions. Most of the colors were mixed directly on the canvas rather than on the palette (fig. 2.35). At times, the artist dipped his brush into two or three separate colors before applying a stroke to the canvas, and swirls of unmixed paint can be seen throughout the work (fig. 2.36).\n\nThe soft edges of the objects and figures\u2014at times defined as much by the texture of the brushstroke, a physical ridge of paint, as by the color shift itself\u2014indicate that Renoir alternated between thicker paint applied with a soft brush and more medium-rich or sometimes thinned paint applied with a stiffer brush (fig. 2.37). In some areas, soft, curled peaks of paint call attention not to the application of paint but to the lift of the brush (fig. 2.38). It is also noteworthy that he used medium-rich toning layers, sometimes called glazes. The glazes seem limited to the woman in the dark-blue dress, for which he layered translucent, oil-rich dark reds and greens over an opaque blue-and-white mixture to add tonal nuance and a sense of volume, incorporating pure blue, red lake, yellow, and perhaps black (fig. 2.39). This smoothness is countered by heavy brushwork elsewhere and by the artist\u2019s manipulation of the canvas texture. Despite the smoother texture offered by a thick preparation, the artist accentuated the weave texture in many areas, dragging a loaded brush across the surface and catching only the thread tops (fig. 2.40).\n\nBrushes, mostly soft to medium, flat and round, with strokes up to 1 cm wide.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, chrome yellow, viridian, emerald green, vermilion, two red lakes, and possibly chrome orange.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination of the surface suggests the presence of black.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence under UV light indicates that Renoir used fluorescing red lake in areas of the female figure\u2019s costume and chair, and mixed it with other colors in the signature and flesh tones (fig. 2.41). Cross-sectional analysis reveals that he used a second, nonfluorescing red lake in selected areas of the composition.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nA natural-resin varnish was removed and replaced with the current synthetic varnish in 1971. Pretreatment photographs of the verso indicate that the natural-resin varnish had penetrated cracks in the paint layer and stained the back of the canvas (fig. 2.42). This suggests that either the natural-resin varnish was applied after the painting had aged, or the work was cleaned in the past, causing partially dissolved varnish and solvent to stain the canvas (see Conservation History). There are residues of the earlier natural-resin varnish around the areas of impasto. Because the paint is medium rich and the artist-applied ground is nonporous, the current varnish has probably had minimal impact on the overall tonality of the painting. The thin, synthetic surface coating only slightly saturates the painting, adds more gloss, and emphasizes the overall texture of the work.\n\nThe painting\u2019s condition was first documented in 1921, when it was noted that the darks were cracking. In 1971 the painting was cleaned, restretched, lined, and revarnished. The 1971 pretreatment condition notes indicate that the work was stretched on a five-member stretcher and had brittle fabric and a discolored varnish. Before the lining was applied, grime and the natural-resin varnish were removed with solvents, while additional overpaint on the right figure\u2019s pants was removed mechanically. The lining process involved facing the work with starch paste, and then adhering a new piece of linen with wax resin. The painting was restretched on a redwood ICA spring stretcher slightly larger than the composition, leaving a small, unpainted border around the perimeter. The changes to the dimensions are as follows: in the pretreatment report, the work measured 21 5/16 \u00d7 25 1/2 in., while in the posttreatment report it was listed as 21 5/8 \u00d7 25 7/8 in. After the painting had been restretched and the facing removed, it was given three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA) and retouched.\n\nThe work is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and attached to a four-member spring stretcher with tacks. The wax resin has saturated the commercial priming layer and, in conjunction with accumulated grime, has altered the ground color from white to taupe, while the heat and pressure of the lining process slightly increased the textural presence of the weave. Due to the thickness of the selective preparatory layer and subsequent paint layers, the overall tonality of the painting does not appear to be affected. Some areas of thinner paint, areas of exposed commercial priming, and thinner areas of artist-applied priming were slightly pushed into the canvas by the pressure and heat of the lining process (microcracking is visible under the microscope). The original tacking margins were flattened when the painting was lined, and much abrasion is present around the original edges of the work. Some of this abrasion, as well as other mild abrasion throughout the work, is likely a result of the prelining cleaning. The restretching increased the dimensions on all sides, leaving an unpainted border almost one-quarter-inch wide around the edges of the composition. The paint layer is in very good condition, with few areas of cracking and localized minor losses. Pronounced cracking is limited to the dark-blue dress of the female figure on the left, where Renoir apparently employed medium-rich glazes. The work has a glossy synthetic varnish, and minor residues of discolored natural-resin varnish are present around areas of impasto.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (2008): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Paris), mid-nineteenth-century, Neoclassical Revival, cove frame with cabled fluting, acanthus leaves at the miters, and a stepped frieze. The frame has water and oil gilding over red bole on gesso and compo ornament. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished; the cove is burnished and retains its original gilding and glue sizing. The pine molding is mitered and joined with angled, dovetailed splines. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is guilloche outer molding; cove side; fillet; torus with molded, centered, imbricated laurel-and-berry ornament and acanthus leaves at the miters; fillet; cove with cabled fluting and buds and acanthus leaves at the miters; and stepped frieze in three sections: ribbon and stave followed by fillet, leaf tip followed by fillet and cove, and fillet with cove sight edge (fig. 2.43).\n\nPrevious frame (removed 2008): The painting was previously housed in an American (New York), mid-twentieth-century, French Regency, stylized frame of water-gilt, carved basswood with a d\u00e9cap\u00e9 finish (fig. 2.44).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933, removed sometime between 1960 and c. 1975): The work was previously housed in a late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV Revival, convex frame with deeply recessed cast plaster ornament of alternating flowers and pendent bellflowers, bracketed by foliate scrolls, with acanthus leaves at the miters. The frame had water and oil gilding on a dark red-brown bole over gesso and cast plaster. The sides and frieze were burnished, and the ornament was selectively burnished. The gilding was toned with raw umber and a white wash and speckled overall with black and white. The molding was mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ovolo with leaf-tip ornament; scotia side; convex face with alternating flower and pendent bellflower ornament, bracketed by foliate scrolls, with acanthus leaves at the miters; hollow frieze; ogee with leaf-tip ornament; cove; and fillet with cove sight edge (fig. 2.45).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, July 8, 1881, for 600 francs.\n\nAcquired by Alphonse Legrand, Paris, by Nov. 21, 1887.\n\nSold by Alphonse Legrand, Paris, to Boussod, Valadon &amp; Cie (Theo van Gogh), Paris, Nov. 21, 1887, for 200 francs.\n\nSold by Boussod, Valadon &amp; Cie (Theo van Gogh), Paris, to Guyotin, Paris, Nov. 22, 1887, for 350 francs.\n\nSold by Guyotin, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Mar. 21, 1892, for 1,300 francs.\n\nTransferred from Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Mar. 22, 1892.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, Apr. 9, 1892, for $1,100.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, 11, rue Le Peletier, 2e exposition de peinture [second Impressionist exhibition], Apr. 1876, cat. 221, as D\u00e9je\u00fbner chez Fournaise.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Paintings from the Collection of Mrs. Potter Palmer, May 10\u2013Nov. 1910, cat. 51, as Breakfast by the river.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, May 23\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 350.

He may be the bearded model of the same name who inspired Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec twenty years later in M. de Lauradour (1897; Museum of Modern Art, New York). See Henri Perruchot, Toulouse-Lautrec, trans. Humphrey Hare (Perpetua Books, 1960), p. 234. The possibility that Lauradour was a doctor from a noble family in Poitou is tantalizing, as it would place him in Renoir\u2019s circle of ex-military men, including Baron Paul Barbier and Prince Georges Bibesco, an important early patron of Renoir\u2019s who met the artist in the 1860s at La Grenouill\u00e8re. See references to Marie-Albert de Lauradour in L\u2019\u00e9cho des jeunes, Nov. 15, 1896, p. 217 (\u201cLe D\u00eener du Poitou\u201d); Guide Rosenwald (1900), p. 347 (\u201cDocteurs du d\u00e9partement: Lauradour, Batignolles, 80, St. Ouen (Seine)\u201d); Annuaire de l\u2019arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise (1903), p. 239 (\u201cm\u00e9decin aide-major de 1re classe, De Lauradour, M.A.\u201d); Gil Blas, Dec. 21, 1897, p. 4 (Lauradour won a \u201c2e poule\u201d in fencing).\n\nIn \u201cFemme de Paul\u201d Maupassant describes \u201cgrands gaillards en maillot blanc\u201d; Guy de Maupassant, \u201cFemme de Paul,\u201d in Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes de Guy de Maupassant, vol. 3 (L.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination suggested the presence of black and red lake, which were not detected with XRF. Red lake can also be verified by the faint orange fluorescence noted in this area when viewed under UV light (see Palette).\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, treatment report, Oct. 17, 1971, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise (The Rowers' Lunch), Pierre-August Renoir, 1875 (D305/1922.437),\u201d Feb. 2012.\n\nThis depth measurement is based on the original tacking margins, which are somewhat damaged due to age and previous treatment.\n\nThe stamp is visible in pretreatment and transmitted infrared images. Carpentier was located at 6, rue Hal\u00e9vy; the workshop was located at 62, rue Legendre. See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), p. 63; see also David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 42.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis additional layer is visible in the X-ray and stereomicroscopic examination but cannot be confirmed by cross-sectional analysis and therefore is probably not an overall layer.\n\nThe presence of lead, barium, and iron was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected small amounts of silicates, silica, calcium-based whites such as calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate, and trace amounts of bone black. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_RowersLunch\\_22\\_437\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d June 29, 2009; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of lead, barium, iron, and calcium was confirmed with XRF. However, XRF analysis alone cannot confirm the presence of two distinct ground layers, as analysis of any area penetrates all layers down to the canvas. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_RowersLunch\\_22\\_437\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d June 29, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nSimilar black material, though in a seemingly fluid medium directly on the white ground, was found in a cross section of the back outline of the female figure in Renoir\u2019s Le Caf\u00e9 (1876\u201377; Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum, Otterlo). See Aviva Burnstock, Klaas Jan van den Berg, and John House, \u201cPainting Techniques of Pierre-Auguste Renoir: 1868\u20131919,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 3 (2005), p. 58. The other dark paint strokes seen in the infrared image, which correspond to brushwork in the female figure\u2019s shoulder and other areas, indicate the presence of infrared-absorbing pigments.\n\nThe presence of lead white, cobalt blue, red lake, and vermilion in this area was confirmed with SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, vermilion, emerald green (XRF, SEM/EDX); viridian, chrome yellow, chrome orange (XRF); and two red lakes (SEM/EDX). XRF analysis also suggested the presence of zinc in selected areas. The detection of zinc in the area of the female figure\u2019s right arm (in the dark-blue dress) could be due to the presence of zinc yellow, though it should be noted that no potassium was detected. It is possible that zinc yellow is present in very small amounts, as small amounts of potassium would be below the detection limit of the instrument. The presence of zinc could also indicate zinc soaps (present as a manufacturer\u2019s additive) or zinc white, which may have been incorporated into the tube paint to lighten the hue. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_RowersLunch\\_22\\_437\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d June 29, 2009; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nXRF analysis confirmed the presence of a cobalt-containing pigment, while SEM/EDX of two cross sections with multiple blue-containing layers indicated only the presence of cobalt blue. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_RowersLunch\\_22\\_437\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d June 29, 2009; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nStereomicroscope examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the orange is chrome orange rather than a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_RowersLunch\\_22\\_437\\_XRF\\_results,\u201d June 29, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nOptical microscopy of cross sections was performed by Inge Fiedler. Analysis suggests that the substrate for both lakes was aluminum based. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_437\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 15, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed.
