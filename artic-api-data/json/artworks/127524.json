    "description": "<p>Although Anthonie Waterloo made several hundred landscape drawings and etchings, his principal vocation was that of a print dealer. This brought him into contact with works by Dutch landscape artists such as Roelant Roghman and Jacob van Ruisdael, both of whom influenced his own art.<br>The trees in this print, executed with a realism that indicates they were sketched out of doors, foreground a scene from the biblical book 1 Kings. The story tells of an old prophet who tricks a clergyman into doubting God. A lion kills the clergyman, but instead of eating him, the beast guards his body. The old prophet, repentant for the role he played in the man\u2019s death, brings his body back on a donkey and gives the clergyman a proper burial.</p>\n",
