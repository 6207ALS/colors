His decision to return to the medium can be attributed to a number of factors. Paris was the center of a great surge of interest in lithography during the mid-1880s, and this momentum eventually had an impact in Britain. On 3 March 1887 a review in the Standard praised a lithograph that had been included in a show of Whistler\u2019s etchings at the Hogarth Club: \u201cAs fine lithography is now so little encouraged, we must not end without saying that there is one lithograph\u2014a study of a girl reading. It is from the interesting group of Whistler\u2019s lithographs, printed by Mr. Way some years ago, and never yet formally published.\u201d\n\nIn the autumn of the same year, the London branch of the French publishing firm Boussod, Valadon, and Co. decided to publish Whistler\u2019s Art Notes, which had been abandoned for lack of interest in 1878, as a portfolio entitled Notes. It contained six of the early lithographs: Limehouse (cat. 7), Nocturne (cat. 8), Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14), Victoria Club (cat. 15), Reading (cat. 17), and Old Battersea Bridge (cat. 18). Only thirty impressions of Limehouse were published in this set, since the image began to show wear and was erased from the stone. Within four days the ten signed artist\u2019s proofs\u2014presumably used to test the market\u2014had been sold by the Goupil Gallery (the exhibition and sales venue of Boussod, Valadon, and Co.), which asked Whistler for ten more. Eager to realize a profit, Whistler manipulated the market by charging nearly twice as much for signed impressions on large sheets of paper as for unsigned impressions on small sheets. Thirty sets of all six, mounted on large sheets, were issued in brown paper wrappers at four guineas a set, while seventy sets of the last five plates (excluding Limehouse) were issued on smaller sheets, also in brown wrappers, and sold for two guineas a set. The large-paper sets were soon disposed of, but a considerable number of the smaller sets, perhaps because they lacked cachet, remained unsold even at Whistler\u2019s death.\n\nWhistler exhibited four of the lithographs (cat. 7, cat. 8, cat. 14, and cat. 15) at the Winter Exhibition of the Royal Society of British Artists in November 1887, and the critical reaction echoed the response in 1880 to the Venice etchings. Critics failed to understand the slighter ones, and collectors followed suit. The critic for the Pall Mall Gazette commented that Limehouse and Nocturne were \u201cfairly complete pictures\u2014the latter especially, which is more finished, and, moreover, more demonstrative of the artist\u2019s power than anything of the kind we have recently seen,\u201d while scoffing at slighter works, saying of Gaiety Stage Door that \u201ca door and a window are there to suggest a theatre, while a horse in the foreground is actually suggested by the omission of his head and tail. To such lengths does Mr. Whistler carry his theory of \u2018suggestion.\u2019\u201d Nonetheless, Whistler\u2019s interest in lithography was rekindled.\n\nLONDON VIEWS, 1887. In September Whistler headed out with three \u201cextremely hard and brittle\u201d crayons and some transfer paper. The London etchings of the mid-1880s had taken the artist to the East End, into Spital fields, Houndsditch, and Smithfield. In 1887 he returned to this area and began in lithography where he had left off in etching. In addition to the small sketchbooks he generally carried with him at this time, he now carried small blocks of 4 1/2\" \u00d7 7\" transfer paper. Whistler worked on the papier viennois supplied by Way even though he disliked the grain that the reticulate pattern stamped on the gummed surface of the paper imparted to his lithographs. Way recalled that the artist \u201cfound he could quite conveniently take a little packet of transfer paper about with him, and draw on the spot from nature.\u201d On this occasion,\n\nhe annexed one of [Way\u2019s] sketching pads consisting of a couple of pieces of cardboard, between which the transfer paper is kept, and an open cardboard mount to lay over the drawing and hold it on the pad, the whole being bound together by an india rubber band; and he carried a supply of chalks in a little antique silver box in his pocket.\n\nWhistler\u2019s decision to make lithographic views of the area around the church of Saint Bartholomew the Great and the abutting Cloth Fair in Smithfield reflects his interest in recording areas of vanishing London, a project he first pursued in the Thames views of 1858. The Norman church and the thirteenth-century gate to the adjacent cemetery had been a major focus of preservationist concern for some time. In 1887 its continued existence, long threatened, had finally been assured, and plans for restoration were under way; unfortunately, that restoration would necessitate the demolition of the encroaching medieval houses in Cloth Fair.\n\nLondon\u2019s architectural heritage was vanishing at an unprecedented rate in the face of high Victorian growth and change, and its documentation was being undertaken increasingly by photographers. Whistler appears to have been aware of the work of the Society for Photographing Relics of Old London (SPROL), an organization formed in 1875 in response to the demolition facing many historic structures. Between 1875 and 1886, Alfred Bool and Henry Dixon published 120 high-quality carbon prints, which were sold in annual portfolios to an ever-increasing number of subscribers, doing a great deal to raise public awareness of London\u2019s vanishing heritage. In 1886 SPROL disbanded with the statement: \u201cIt is not suggested that the subject has been exhausted, but it is hoped that the work may be regarded as fairly complete within the lines at first marked out.\u201d Antiquarian interest engendered by the publicity surrounding the fate of St. Bartholomew\u2019s, together with the gap that had recently opened up in the market for the documentation of such sites, probably accounts for Whistler\u2019s decision to record this precinct\u2014perhaps in the hope that he might sell the images to a periodical or to collectors with preservationist instincts. Whistler had first recorded the tottering medieval tenements in Cloth Fair around the church in the etching Little Smithfield (K 160), probably made in 1877, the composition of which corresponds closely to Bool\u2019s photograph The North Side of the Church and the Poor\u2019s Churchyard, published that same year. Whistler\u2019s lithograph Churchyard (cat. 21) bears a similar resemblance to Bool\u2019s Churchyard Looking toward Cloth Fair (fig. 21b). The lithograph Little Court, Cloth Fair (cat. 22) of 1887 recorded the characteristic appearance of the street before it disappeared (fig. 1), and Entrance Gate (cat. 20) depicted the threatened cemetery gate, also documented in contemporary photographs (fig. 20a).\n\nIn addition to his work in the East End, in 1887 Whistler made lithographs closer to home in Chelsea, including Lindsey Row, Chelsea (cat. 23), a view of the street on which he had lived during the 1860s and 1870s and which was soon to disappear and become part of Cheyne Walk with the extension of the Thames embankment. The Chelsea lithographs of 1888 are closely related to the small Chelsea paintings of 1880/87 and etchings of 1886/88. In all of these works, Whistler used the small format and tight cropping of the subject to create intimate, self-contained, urban images.\n\nWHISTLER AND MALLARM\u00c9: SYMBOLIST VISION AND COLLABORATION. In his attempt to educate public taste and make his work better understood, Whistler delivered a lecture entitled \u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s Ten O\u2019Clock\u201d at Prince\u2019s Hall in London on 20 February, 1885. In a dramatic presentation, he maintained:\n\nNature contains the elements, in colour and form, of all pictures, as the keyboard contains the notes of all music.\n\nBut the artist is born to pick, and choose, and group with science, these elements, that the result may be beautiful\u2014as the musician gathers his notes, and forms his chords, until he bring forth from chaos glorious harmony.\n\nA hush fell over the audience when he came to the poetic passage in which he described the source of inspiration for his nocturnes:\n\nAnd when the evening mist clothes the riverside with poetry, as with a veil, and the poor buildings lose themselves in the dim sky, and the tall chimneys become campanili, and the warehouses are palaces in the night, and the whole city hangs in the heavens, and fairyland is before us\u2014then the wayfarer hastens home; the working man and the cultured one, the wise man and the one of pleasure, cease to understand, as they have ceased to see, and Nature, who, for once, has sung in tune, sings her exquisite song to the artist alone, her son and her master\u2014her son in that he loves her, her master in that he knows her.\n\nIt was this lecture that brought Whistler to the attention of the French symbolist poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9. Th\u00e9odore Duret, who was present at Prince\u2019s Hall, may have introduced them in 1886/87. Claude Monet arranged the lunch on 8 January 1888 at which the artist and poet became fast friends. The text of Whistler\u2019s \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture had just been published in London and New York, and Mallarm\u00e9 offered to translate it into French. When the translation appeared in La Revue ind\u00e9pendante four months later, Mallarm\u00e9 wrote to Whistler saying: \u201cJe sympathisais tout avec votre vision de l\u2019Art\u201d and stated that he was \u201cheureux d\u2019une occasion de mettre mon nom au dessous du v\u00f4tre.\u201d Although their personalities were very different, Whistler and Mallarm\u00e9 recognized the compatability of the visions they had achieved independently, and welcomed each other\u2019s friendship and support in the struggle for understanding and recognition. According to Henri de R\u00e9gnier, Mallarm\u00e9 was attracted to Whistler\u2019s personal style and eccentricity, as well as to \u201cson art myst\u00e9rieux et raisonn\u00e9, plein de subtiles pratiques et de recettes compliqu\u00e9es.\u201d\n\nSymbolism took very different forms in the hands of its adherents, but in general it constituted a reaction against the realist and impressionist description of the world of phenomena in favor of inner exploration and subjective expression. The subtlest form, to which Mallarm\u00e9 and his circle subscribed, involved exploring the essential reality that lies beneath the surface and, through a variety of art forms, trying to express the timelessness and universal significance of that reality. They looked upon nature and human experience as sources for personal metaphors or \u201cexpressive correspondences.\u201d The metaphors of the symbolists were never static, but continued to develop new layers of meaning, becoming ever more complex. Because their works are enigmatic and elusive, it is extremely difficult to identify, let alone interpret, these metaphors. Mallarm\u00e9 made himself so obscure that Whistler, like most people, had difficulty understanding his writings. A great conversationalist but never a great reader, Whistler probably absorbed the ideas of Mallarm\u00e9 and his circle at the poet\u2019s Tuesday salons, rather than through the pages of the inscribed presentation copies Mallarm\u00e9 sent to him. The artist and poet banded together to promote understanding and recognition for each other\u2019s work in their respective countries. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s success in promoting Whistler\u2019s work in France was a major factor in the artist\u2019s growing desire to move to Paris. Whistler\u2019s promotion of Mallarm\u00e9 in Britain led to their identification as kindred spirits.\n\nWhistler had submitted the lithograph The Winged Hat (cat. 34) to a new London periodical, The Whirlwind: A Lively and Eccentric Newspaper, a journal that purported to represent the views not of the critics Whistler despised, but of writers, poets, and artists. He wrote enthusiastically of the magazine to Mallarm\u00e9, and sent the poet several copies, encouraging him to distribute them in Paris. Mallarm\u00e9 greatly admired The Winged Hat and wrote to Whistler: \u201cLa lithographie m\u2019enchante, vous la traitez en ma\u00eetre absolu, du premier coup, comme l\u2019eau-forte: et quel dessin, mon cher Whistler! mordant et \u00e9l\u00e9gant, de charme supreme.\u201d In order to provide Mallarm\u00e9 with an opportunity to publish in England, Whistler proposed in 1890 that they jointly submit a lithograph and poem to The Whirlwind to be printed side by side. With this in mind, he delayed publication of The Tyresmith (cat. 36) until Mallarm\u00e9 had written and submitted \u201cBillet \u00e0 Whistler,\u201d which he promised would be \u201cun petit sonnet de congratulation, avec v\u00f4tre nom \u00e0 la rime.\u201d In the sonnet, Art, personified as a dancer, appears in a \u201cwhirlwind of muslin\u201d in the gusty streets of a town, and Whistler, in dandy attire, is fanned by her skirts. Mallarm\u00e9 intimated in his poem that the winds generated by the periodical were not just gossip or passing amusement, but winds of the spirit that would blow down everything but Whistler himself. Whistler was enchanted by the sonnet, especially by the phrases that related directly to himself: \u201cla rue / Sujette au noir vol de chapeaux,\u201d which is perhaps an indirect reference to the lithograph The Winged Hat, and \u201cPuisse l\u2019air / De sa jupe \u00e9venter Whistler\u201d; he pronounced these passages \u201csuperbe\u201d and \u201cdandy.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9 was delighted with the final appearance of their joint effort, and wrote to Whistler: \u201cTout cela est fait Whistleriennement: cette page enti\u00e8re, inouie! . . .cela \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d\u2019une oeuvre de vous, laquelle, des deux, est le vrai Song.\u201d\n\nWhistler did all he could to promote appreciation for Mallarm\u00e9 in Britain. In an unsigned editorial in The Whirlwind, he called Mallarm\u00e9 the\u201craffin\u00e9 Prince of \u2018Decadents\u2019\u2014the classic of Modernity,\u201d and \u201cthe most vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle poet in France.\u201d He informed \u201cthe barbarians in these islands\u201d that it was a privilege for them to hear \u201cthis latest trill of that Singer.\u201d Referring to the aesthetic tie that drew the artist and poet together, he declared:\n\nColour, harmony, and musical effect alone bring with them that completeness, that polished finish, that correction, which accompany, infallibly the work of the Master. These high verities are revealed only born with the Artist\u2019s power to apply them.\n\nWhen Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s Vers et Prose was being planned in 1891 with the Belgian publisher Edmond Deman, the poet hoped to replace the etched portrait by F\u00e9licien Rops that had served as the frontispiece to an 1887 edition with an etched portrait by Whistler. The artist was unable to provide an etching for the Belgian edition, but Mallarm\u00e9 renewed his request when the Paris firm Perrin et Cie published another edition of the work in 1893. A thousand impressions would be needed, and Mallarm\u00e9 realized that Whistler would never have allowed an etched plate to be printed in such a large edition; Whistler decided to make a lithograph instead. It was at about this time that he was introduced by his old friend Fantin-Latour to a smooth, transparent transfer paper called papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, He procured some from Lemercier and used it for the portrait of Mallarm\u00e9. Its great advantage was that it did not impart a mechanical grain. It gave a soft, blurred quality to the line, which Whistler much preferred to the brilliance and crispness the textured transfer paper gave him. Probably because Thomas Way was unfamiliar at the time with handling papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, however, Whistler continued to use the textured papier viennois after drawing the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait. Only in August 1894 did Way learn the correct method of working with textureless transfer paper; from then on, Whistler used it.\n\nWhistler\u2019s lithographic image of Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 60; see also cat. 59) was both a portrait and a metaphor for the man himself. Whistler achieved the blurred or rubbed appearance of charcoal, an aesthetic effect that coincided with Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s view of matter as impermanent and evanescent. This was achieved by superimposing the thin papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal over a textured surface\u2014in this case a buckram book binding\u2014and shifting it whenever the pattern became too regular, a technique previously used by Fantin-Latour and Odilon Redon. Whistler also made the form and contours more enigmatic and elusive by drawing the figure by firelight. Flames danced around the form, throwing shadows on the wall and suggesting both the creative energy and mysterious depths of the poet\u2019s imagination. Although Whistler strove for the appearance of improvisation, the final result was far from spontaneous either in its evolution or execution. He redrew the portrait several times before, as Duret put it, successfully \u201ccondensant toute l\u2019observation accumul\u00e9e par les essais pr\u00e9liminaires\u201d in a last triumphant effort.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Whistler succeeded in capturing the characteristics of his sitter. Duret wrote of the portrait: \u201cMallarm\u00e9 est d\u2019une \u00e9tonnante ressemblance, le bras en mouvement et la t\u00eate inclin\u00e9e selon son habitude, lorsqu\u2019il conversait avec ses amis. Ceux qui l'ont connu peuvent croire qu\u2019ils l\u2019entendent parler. L\u2019image n\u2019existe cependant que comme un souffle, elle est venue du plus rapide coup de crayon.\u201d Georges Rodenbach saw in Whistler\u2019s portrait \u201cun homme au R\u00eave habitu\u00e9,\u201d the visionary and enigmatic author, and described \u201cce visage qu\u2019on regarde comme un reflet, que semble \u00eatre vu dans un miroir, vu dans l\u2019eau. C\u2019est le po\u00e8te comme il subsiste dans la m\u00e9moire, d\u00e9j\u00e0 en un recul, hors du temps, tel qu\u2019il appara\u00ectra \u00e0 l\u2019avenir. . . . Ainsi il s\u2019isole, s\u2019\u00e9loigne de la vie, appartient tout au R\u00eave.\u201d The poet himself was thrilled, and wrote that \u201cce portrait est une merveille, la seule chose qui ait \u00e9t\u00e9 jamais faite d\u2019apr\u00e8s moi, et je m\u2019y souris.\u201d Whistler sent Mallarm\u00e9 a proof inscribed \u201cA mon Mallarm\u00e9,\u201d and received a copy of Vers et Prose inscribed \u201cWhistler / selon qui je d\u00e9fie/ Le ssi\u00e8cles, en lithographie.\u201d\n\nThe lithographic portraits made by firelight are formally related to the black-chalk portrait drawings dating from Whistler\u2019s realist phase, such as Sleeping Woman (fig. 3 [M 310]). These were closely related to the self-portraits of this period by his friend Fantin-Latour, which were built up using slashing diagonals of varied densities that obscured the contours and created the tenebroso effects the realists so admired in the work of Rembrandt and his Dutch contemporaries. Whistler\u2019s late graphic style, first fully realized in his Venice etchings of 1880, was a development of his realist drawing style as employed in two fireside portraits of Frederick Leyland, Portrait of Frederick R. Leyland (fig. 2 [M 426]) and Portrait Study of Frederick R. Leyland (M 425r; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), in which the sitter is vignetted in keeping with the artist\u2019s striving for the reduction of all but essential detail. The late graphic style is exemplified by the symbolist portrait St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 60) where the linear and tonal elements, consisting of groups of hatched parallel lines, combine to suggest form rather than state it.\n\nTHE THINLY DRAPED FEMALE: A SHARED METAPHOR. The theme of the beautiful woman, thinly draped, was one Whistler shared with Mallarm\u00e9 and other members of the poet\u2019s circle. In 1890 their mutual friend Comte Robert de Montesquiou-Fezensac sent Whistler a poem entitled \u201cLa petite femme\u2014et drap\u00e9e au mieux,\u201d inspired by one of Whistler\u2019s pastels. In 1891 Mallarm\u00e9 sent Whistler a copy of his poem \u201cPages,\u201d on the theme of the beauty of women inspiring the poet. To both Whistler and Mallarm\u00e9, woman symbolized the creative idea and the source of poetic and artistic inspiration.\n\nThe image of the dancer had special meaning for Mallarm\u00e9. In his 1886 essay \u201cBallets,\u201d he wrote about the dancer La Cornalba: \u201c[Elle] danse comme d\u00e9v\u00eatue; c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que sans le semblant d\u2019aide offert \u00e0 un enl\u00e8vement ou \u00e0 la chute par une pr\u00e9sence volante et assoupie de gazes, elle para\u00eet, appel\u00e9e dans l\u2019air, s\u2019y soutenir.\u201d The poet believed that if the viewer allowed himself to enter into a state of reverie, and watched the dancer passively, she would inspire the poetic instinct, and \u201celle te livre \u00e0 travers le voile dernier qui toujours reste, la nudit\u00e9 de tes concepts et silencieusement \u00e9crira ta vision \u00e0 la fa\u00e7on d\u2019 un Signe, qu\u2019elle est.\u201d Whistler, like a number of other artists in Paris during the early 1890s (especially those in Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s circle), was interested in contemporary dance, which was at a transitional phase in its development, becoming increasingly free and expressive. Many of the symbolists knew the work of the American dancer Lo\u00efe Fuller, and, in a variety of media, depicted the famous butterfly dance in which she manipulated her skirt with sticks and was engulfed in swirling silk (see fig. 4). Fuller had performed in London at the Gaiety Theatre, near Thomas Way\u2019s shop, as early as 1890, and in late 1892 made her debut in Paris. In March 1893 Mallarm\u00e9 published a brief essay about the dancer, describing her performance as a \u201cdon avec ing\u00e9nuit\u00e9 et certitude fait par l\u2019\u00e9tranger fant\u00f4me au Ballet ou la forme th\u00e9\u00e2trale de po\u00e9sie par excellence: le reconna\u00eetre, entier, dans ses cons\u00e9quences tard, \u00e0 la faveur du recul.\u201d Mallarm\u00e9 was struck by the minimal stage setting Fuller used\u2014she relied almost solely on her flowing drapery and on lighting, in some instances using mirrors or glass to reflect the light and her movements. Whistler\u2019s 1892 sketch of Fuller\u2019s butterfly dance (fig. 5 [M 1346]) reveals a similar fascination with the ethereal effects of her costume and movement. In developing this theme further in his work, Whistler\u2019s interest shifted from the posed, static figure to thinly draped models who moved freely about the studio. He sought to capture only the essential detail of the active form, creating images of motion and transience rather than stillness and permanence.\n\nWhistler had first employed the thinly draped model as a symbol of ideal beauty devoid of narrative content in the 1860s, while studying with Albert Moore. Both artists saw Greek art, exemplified by the newly unearthed Tanagra terracotta figurines, as the epitome of occidental beauty, and Japanese ukiyo-e prints as the epitome of oriental beauty. In their paintings and drawings of beautiful women clad in Grecian dress and holding oriental fans, Whistler and Moore created a synthesis of these two very different ideals of beauty. Although Whistler left this motif to Moore after 1870, he would return to it later. In his \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture, he provided the key for understanding the metaphor of the thinly draped Grecian figure, with her \u201cmeasured rhyme of lovely limb and draperies flowing in unison.\u201d In the last passage of his lecture, the artist stated: \u201cThe story of the beautiful is already complete\u2014hewn in the marbles of the Parthenon\u2014and broidered with the birds, upon the fan of Hokusai\u2014at the foot of Fusi-yama.\u201d In the 1890s Whistler took up this theme where he had left off, creating new variations in pastel, watercolor, and lithography. His renewed interest may have been triggered in part by the fact that during the 1890s Whistler had in his possession a set of photographs of the Ionides Tanagras (he was assisting with the sale of the collection); he made several sketches based on them.\n\nBetween 1890 and 1895, Whistler made many lithographs showing thinly draped figures that are reminiscent of the Tanagras in both dress and attitude (see cat. 31, cat. 48, cat. 72, cat. 74, cat. 76, cat. 77, cat. 113, and cat. 114). In these images the model wears a translucent undergarment, the \u201cchiton,\u201d and a mantle, the \u201chimation,\u201d which flow about her form, partly revealing and partly concealing her anatomy. To the Greek costume, Whistler sometimes added a Japanese touch\u2014a fan or kimono that recalls the courtesans in ukiyo-e woodcuts, who were themselves symbols of ideal beauty in their cloistered interiors. Groups of two figures, each consisting of a mother and child, are rare and probably symbolize Aphrodite and Eros (see fig. 10). Like the Tanagras, the figures in the lithographs assume several characteristic poses: standing, sitting upright, reclining, or dancing. Many of the Tanagra figures are shown performing the \u201cmantle dance,\u201d in which their draperies swirl around them. Whistler would have known the splendid collection of Tanagra figurines in the Louvre, among them Veiled Dancer.\n\nThe first of the Tanagra lithographs may have been The Dancing Girl (cat. 29). Whistler sent an impression to Mallarm\u00e9 on 3 January 1890; the poet considered it a \u201cmerveille,\u201d commented on its beauty, and hung it on his wall. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s enthusiastic response may have stimulated Whistler to continue his work with this theme. The artist also depicted dancing figures in the lithographs La Danseuse: A Study of the Nude (cat. 49) and Draped Model, Dancing (cat. 50), and he made a number of lithographs of nude or lightly draped models over the next few years. These are personifications of grace, delicacy, gaiety, and charm, the tenets of Whistler\u2019s aesthetic position. Their draperies both display and disguise the moving figure, the beauty of which, like the dance, is transient. Whistler exploited the characteristics inherent in the transfer process, giving the lithographs a more tentative and ephemeral appearance.\n\nWhistler\u2019s The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) of 1893 is the incarnation of Art as Whistler described her in his \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture\u2014shown in classical dress, seated on the sofa in his studio, she is veiled, mysterious, and endlessly fascinating, rearranging herself constantly. In this lithograph Whistler felt that he had finally mastered the stump technique, which he had first used in Brittany earlier that year. Way equated the effects Whistler achieved using stump in lithography to those obtained with drypoint in etching. Stumping enabled Whistler to obtain the sfumato effects that hint at an evolving symbolist aesthetic. His technical facility transformed The Draped Figure, Seated into a Mallarm\u00e9an poem on stone, the visual image rendered more elusive by the soft, blurring effect of the stump. He wrote to Way:\n\nI am getting now a richness with it\u2014a certain velvety daintiness\u2014quite unlike anything I have ever seen. . . . There is a quality about the work now\u2014or beginning to be perhaps\u2014that is quite as fascinating as anything in the etchings\u2014But it is nothing to what I shall get yet!\u2014The little sitting figure in drapery I am immensely pleased with. . . . I am getting to use the stump just like a brush\u2014and the work is beginning to have the mystery in execution of a painting.\n\nWhile certain parts of the model are clearly revealed, others are left to the imagination. The image is ghostly, dreamlike, more like something remembered than something seen. The mysterious figure with her shifting contours floats like a mirage on the surface of the sheet, no more substantial than smoke or images seen in mirrors.\n\nThe thinly draped women allude to symbolist themes as well as symbolist formal treatment. In The Horoscope (cat. 30), reading tea leaves in her cup, she recalls the seer or oracle; in Girl with Bowl (cat. 118), contemplating a piece of pottery, she appears as an aesthete; and in Draped Figure, Standing (cat. 46), where she assumes a provocative pose, she is transformed into a femme fatale. In a number of sketches on transfer paper entitled Mother and Child (cat. 51, cat. 52, cat. 53, cat. 54, cat. 55, cat. 138, and dwg. IV, dwg. V, and dwg. VI), Whistler explored the theme of woman as nurturer, depicting young models cradling an infant. They recall Tanagra figurines of Aphrodite nursing Eros, most notably An Interesting Group (fig. 10) in the Ionides collection. Whistler explored the same theme in the etching Cameo, No. 2 (K 348) of the early 1890s, the pastel Mother and Child: The Pearl (M 1290; The Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C.), and the watercolor Rose and Pink\u2014The Mother\u2019s Sleep (fig. 6 [M 1300]).\n\nIn 1888 Whistler had married Beatrix Godwin, the widow of the architect Edward William Godwin. Her material circumstances enabled Whistler to live more comfortably and securely than ever before. An artist in her own right, she encouraged his interest in lithography, believing him capable of great things. His devotion to her, and the pleasure he took in their domestic existence, is clearly expressed in the lithographs made during their marriage.\n\nTHE MOVE TO PARIS: NEW SUBJECTS AND STRATEGIES. For ten years following his return from Venice, Whistler had tried without success to establish himself in Britain. His wit turned to sarcasm and his sense of humor to bitterness as official recognition continually eluded him: he was never invited to become a Royal Academician, was never offered a knighthood, and remained the brunt of philistine jokes. As president of the Society of British Artists, he may have hoped for a knighthood during the Jubilee year of 1887. While the Society was designated \u201croyal,\u201d neither the etchings he made for the illuminated address to Queen Victoria (K 329, K 331) nor the Naval Review series (K 317\u201328) netted him a decoration. Instead, his brother-in-law and rival, Seymour Haden, founding president of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, was knighted for his leadership in the British etching revival. To add insult to injury, in 1889 Haden received the Grand Prix for etching at the Exposition Universelle in Paris.\n\nAfter a decade of lecturing, writing, and posturing to no avail, Whistler decided to turn his back on \u201cthe Islanders,\u201d and moved his household to Paris in the spring of 1892. Successful at last, happily married, and full of optimism about his future prospects, he found a residence on the rue du Bac in the conservative and aristocratic Faubourg St.-Germain, close to St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Comte Robert de Montesquiou. In France the systematic lobbying of three distinguished friends\u2014the painter Claude Monet, the critic Th\u00e9odore Duret, and the poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2014had brought Whistler the official recognition he had been denied in Britain. In 1889, after his painting Arrangement in Gray and Black: Portrait of the Painter\u2019s Mother (YMSM 101; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris) had been purchased for the Luxembourg, he was made a Chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur; in 1891 he was elevated to the rank of Officier. The artist was understandably gratified by this turn of events.\n\nIronically, his decoration in France led to belated recognition in London. \u201cNocturnes, Marines, and Chevalet Pieces,\u201d a retrospective exhibition that included six of his lithographs, took place at the Goupil Gallery in London in March 1892. It received virtually unanimous praise, and created a market almost overnight for reproductions of Whistler\u2019s once notorious paintings. The printseller Graves, who still retained copyright, sold mezzotints after the artist\u2019s portraits of his mother, Thomas Carlyle, and Rosa Corder, and negotiated an agreement with Thomas Way that would permit the printer to make lithographs after the two paintings. Not surprisingly, the artist was a step ahead of both of them. Whistler, who owned a number of photographs of paintings by artists he admired, realized that photography had rendered reproductive printmaking virtually obsolete, and he decided to take commercial advantage of this mechanical process, which could translate his brushstrokes into halftones. He arranged for a limited edition of twenty-four mounted photographs to be made of paintings in the Goupil exhibition, and signed these with his butterfly, as he would original prints. The photographs could be purchased individually or in a portfolio bearing the title of the exhibition. They must have sold well, for Way complained that the photograph of the Mother undercut the market for his lithograph.\n\nIn Paris Whistler picked up where he had left off with his etchings of 1858, returning to his realist themes and depicting working people in lithography. In 1892\u00ad/93 he made a number of etched and lithographed views of the Luxembourg Gardens, which were near his house and studio. He seems to have been primarily interested in comparing and contrasting the sharp, linear effects he achieved in etching and drypoint with the soft, painterly quality he obtained with lithographic crayon. He explored very similar subjects in The Pantheon, from the Terrace of the Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 70) and Pantheon, Luxembourg Gardens (fig. 8 [K 429]); Nursemaids: \u201cLes Bonnes du Luxembourg\u201d (cat. 81) and B\u00e9b\u00e9s, Luxembourg (K 428); and The Terrace, Luxembourg (cat. 87) and Terrace, Luxembourg Gardens, No. 2 (K 426). A number of lithographs of street scenes in the Faubourg St.-Germain, made during July and August of 1894, show whitesmiths, gardeners, nursemaids, laundresses, and farriers going about their daily tasks. Whistler\u2019s lithographs of this period are subtle, urbane, and casual, providing glimpses of everyday life in Paris in the 1890s: conversations in caf\u00e9s, games of cards, visitors at the Louvre, children playing in the Luxembourg Gardens.\n\nWhen Whistler arrived in Paris, lithography was rapidly growing in popularity, fueled by the first stirrings of excitement over the forthcoming centenary of the medium. Critics, dealers, and publishers in France, Britain, and the United States began to show belated interest in his lithographs. Simultaneously, his enthusiasm for etching abated after he experienced problems with the etching grounds on his Paris plates of 1892\u201393. Within two years of his move to Paris, Whistler\u2019s interest in lithography virtually eclipsed his interest in etching.\n\nIn November 1893 Andr\u00e9 Marty, director of the Journal des artistes, invited Whistler to contribute a lithograph to the fourth album of L\u2019Estampe originale. The artist was thrilled at the prospect of being \u201cin the same box\u201d as Puvis de Chavannes, Bracquemond, Fantin-Latour, and \u201cthe rest,\u201d and after much deliberation contributed the lithograph The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72) of 1893. Although the albums were published in a limited edition, they did much to stimulate interest in lithography in Europe and America. This raised Whistler\u2019s hopes regarding the possibility of further publication. The lavish restoration of his residence and the size of his Paris household (which had grown to include a number of his in-laws) must have placed a severe strain on his finances. For a brief period, he envisioned the possibility of widening the popular market for his lithographs by supplying \u201cdrawings\u201d to London periodicals; he asked T. R. Way to find out how much they were prepared to pay and deputized him to act as agent. Harper\u2019s and the Pall Mall Gazette were soon dismissed, the latter on the grounds that it was \u201cso very vulgar\u201d and too small in size. He settled eventually on the newly formed art periodical The Studio and on the reputable and long-established Art Journal. He decided to charge ten guineas for the use of his lithographs in magazines, and, according to Way, gradually raised the price to twenty guineas. Editions for journals were not to be printed from the original stone; instead Way would retransfer the image to a secondary stone or stones, which would then be used to produce the edition.\n\nIn December 1893, at the height of his enthusiasm, he wrote optimistically to T. R. Way of his aspirations for the future: \u201cI have always been so beastly poor . . . only now I fancy I see fortune looming on the horizon!\u2014and I might really be rich!\u201d Once settled in Paris, Whistler planned \u201cto make lithography a roaring fashion,\u201d and felt himself in the grips of a great creative urge; he continued in his letter to Way: \u201cMy hands are so full\u2014and so is my head\u2014All the endless things I had bottled up for so long in the midst of the hard siege and open war in which I lived over there!\u201d In the spring of 1894, he wrote to the New York dealer Edward Kennedy: \u201cI don\u2019t know about etchings just now\u2014I am greatly interested in the lithographs.\u201d He worked hard to promote his lithographs and conscripted his followers in a complex marketing strategy. In 1894, when Pennell proposed writing an article on the etchings for Scribner\u2019s, Whistler persuaded him that one of the lithographs would be much more interesting; he also encouraged T. R. Way to write a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of his lithographs.\n\nAlthough Whistler continued for several years to publish his lithographs in art periodicals, such as The Studio and The Art Journal, he declared in September 1894 that \u201cwe are altogether too choice for that!\u201d and he also realized that publishing in this way did not result in increased sales to a wider public market. Even when he first began to publish lithographs in Piccadilly, The Whirlwind, and The Albemarle, he had differentiated between hand-printed proofs on fine papers and those appearing in the magazines; and the higher prices he asked for the former reflected this. He always maintained this distinction, treating his lithographs like his etchings, limiting the number of proofs and printing them on \u201cthe same beautiful and rare papers that I use for the etchings,\u201d and he wrote explicitly on the subject to T. R. Way: \u201cAnd this old notion of \u2018popularity\u2019 is all nonsense\u2014I find that only the same old clientelle who collect the etchings, buy the lithographs\u2014and I am not going to give old Dutch paper and Japanese away for nothing\u2014neither am I going to have the proofs on anything inferior.\u201d Consistent with this strategy, he raised his prices.\n\nCOLOR LITHOGRAPHS: \u201cSONGS ON STONE,\u201d 1891\u201395. In 1890 an exhibition of works in black and white took place in Paris in which, according to Joseph Pennell, lithography \u201ctriumphed.\u201d Andr\u00e9 Marty\u2019s publication L\u2019Estampe originale did much to disseminate lithographs by leading international artists. By 1895, when the centenary of the medium\u2019s invention arrived, Henry Hamel was able to pronounce the renaissance complete, declaring confidently that \u201cnous avons remis la lithographie \u00e0 la mode.\u201d\n\nThe lithographic revival in France was characterized by the vogue for color inaugurated by the brilliant posters of Jules Ch\u00e9ret. While Whistler had every intention of making a major contribution in this area, he used color in only seven lithographs. The first, Figure Study in Colors (cat. 39), he made in London in November 1890, assisted by the Ways. In the spring of 1891, Whistler discussed a proposed series of color lithographs, which he titled \u201cSongs on Stone,\u201d with the publisher William Heinemann. Heinemann suggested that an American publisher, Appleton of New York, might take on the job. Whistler must have expressed reservations about Heinemann\u2019s choice (probably because he had already discussed the project with a London publisher), since on May 21 Heinemann reprimanded the artist for referring to Appleton as an \u201cAmerican interloper.\u201d Whistler decided to pursue his color experiments in Paris. Alan Cole, a London acquaintance, recorded the details of a conversation with Whistler on 12 October 1891, in which the artist said that he planned \u201cto make lithographs of his pastels,\u201d but was having problems with the printing. Two and a half weeks later, on Friday, October 30, Whistler began work on color lithographs at Henry Belfond\u2019s firm in Paris.\n\nDraped Figure, Reclining (cat. 56) is arguably Whistler\u2019s most important color lithograph, an image of grace and ideal beauty that becomes the visual correlative of the last sentence in the \u201cTen O\u2019Clock\u201d lecture. Whistler\u2019s aesthetic debt to Japanese prints can be detected in the delicacy of the handling and the asymmetrical balance and placement of the elements of the composition, as well as in the presence of the fan, the heraldic butterfly signature on the wall, and the muted echo of the courtesans of Utamaro. The composition is one Whistler had used twenty years earlier in the drypoints The Model Lying Down (fig. 9 [K 121]) and Nude Girl Reclining (fig. 11 [K 126]), both of around 1873, and echoes two of the most distinctive Tanagras in the Ionides collection, An Interesting Group (fig. 10) and A Group Representing Leda and the Swan (fig. 7). A related watercolor, Rose and Pink\u2014The Mother\u2019s Sleep of 1890/95 (fig. 6 [M 1300]), provides an indication of the effects Whistler was trying to achieve in the lithograph. The colors recall the delicate traces of pigments found on the Tanagra terracottas\u2014red ochre, cinnabar, rose madder, yellow ochre, blue frit, malachite, soot or charcoal, and chalk or gypsum.\n\nThe techniques and aesthetics of color lithography called upon all of Whistler\u2019s fastidiousness and challenged him to daring experimentation. First a drawing on transparent transfer paper would be transferred to stone, thus establishing the keystone. Then Whistler had proofs pulled \u201cin the ordinary way.\u201d Placing sheets of transfer paper over the proofs from the keystone, he made further drawings with reference to the first one that were transferred to subsequent color stones. During printing, the precise registration of each color to the others was effected by means of marks and pinholes in the margins of the images and the sheets. Examining the results of each stage of the printing process, Whistler would sometimes scrape away areas of color from the stones, add new stones and new colors, or change the colors with which the stones were inked. Although Whistler may have been influenced by Hullmandel\u2019s process for color lithography, which was roughly imitative of the effects of watercolor, and by Japanese woodcuts, his own results more closely resemble his pastel drawings in their subtlety and texture. Word began to circulate in London that Whistler had invented a new process of lithography. When asked about this by a journalist, he replied, with uncharacteristic modesty:\n\nNo, scarcely that. There is nothing new under the sun. I am simply busy with some coloured lithographs, which will be seen by-and-bye, and I believe I have arrived at a solution of the uncertainties of colours in lithography . . . but the new system or process, whatever you call it, is merely a return to simplicity.\n\nThe Ways were no doubt disappointed at the prospect of Whistler going to Paris to make color lithographs, and tried to develop a process he could use in London. On 9 April 1892 T. R. Way wrote to Whistler saying that he was \u201cdetermined to succeed with this colour printing,\u201d and that summer he suggested that Whistler should \u201cdo something by the wash process on stone and in colour.\u201d In an effort to encourage the artist, Way made two prints on brown paper reproducing Whistler\u2019s pastels by using stump on stone and sent them to Paris in November. Whistler used the stump on stone and on transfer paper in September 1893 to produce some of his most effective black-and-white images. Had he wanted to achieve color effects on brown paper, he could have used this process; however, he appears to have had very different ideas, and persisted with his work at Belfond\u2019s.\n\nWhistler must have been confident of his ability to complete his series of color lithographs, for a draft agreement with Heinemann for the publication of \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d was drawn up in 1893. The key points covered in this agreement were as follows:\n\n1\\. Heinemann would have publication rights for three years.\n\n2\\. Whistler would provide the lithographs and Heinemann would bear all the expenses of publication.\n\n3\\. Two hundred copies would be published on plate paper and encased in a brown paper wrapper; each part would include four plates and sell for two guineas.\n\n4\\. Fifty copies containing four plates in each, on Japanese paper, signed by the artist, would be sold at five guineas per set; Whistler would receive three guineas in royalties on each copy.\n\n5\\. Royalties would be raised in proportion to any agreed-upon price increase.\n\n6\\. Heinemann would render accounts to Whistler semi-annually, and amounts due would be paid on the Quarter Day following.\n\nWith this publication in mind, Whistler went to Brittany during the summer and made two transfer lithograph \u201cSongs,\u201d Red House, Paimpol (cat. 66) and Yellow House, Lannion (cat. 67). After the drawings had been transferred and printed in color at Belfond\u2019s, he sent Way a proof of Red House on September 20. \u201cYou will see the value of the three colours and that it does not want more,\u201d he noted. No doubt this was intended to show Way the minimal effect he was trying to achieve\u2014the printer\u2019s pastel facsimiles were of Whistler\u2019s earlier pastels on brown paper, which were very different from his new works in lithography.\n\nThese lithographs of picturesque medieval houses recall Whistler\u2019s etching Street at Saverne (fig. 12 [K 19]) of 1858, and the plates of similar subjects that had appeared in the landmark lithographic publication Voyages pittoresques et romantiques dans l\u2019ancienne France published by Baron Taylor in Paris between 1820 and 1828. But the delicate color draws on the British rather than the French tradition, particularly on the work of Thomas Shotter Boys, whose Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Ghent, Antwerp, Rouen, Etc. (London, 1839) stands as a monument in the history of color printing (see fig. 13). Working with the printer and publisher Hullmandel, Boys had achieved near facsimiles of the full chromatic range of watercolor by developing a group of transparent colored inks that could be superimposed using four or five different stones (one for each color) without losing their clarity.\n\nBy early October Whistler was having difficulties with Belfond, and wrote to T. R. Way promising that he would \u201ccome and have another go with colour in Wellington Street.\u201d In November he quarreled with Belfond, bringing work to a halt. The following month, on December 20, he sent two first-state impressions of Yellow House, Lannion to Edward Kennedy, and informed him that there were \u201conly a few printed.\u201d The shipping of stones back and forth across the Channel to Way proved unfeasible, and in the autumn of 1893 Whistler resigned himself to sending drawings on transfer paper. Belfond\u2019s business went bankrupt in 1894 and the stones that Whistler had left in his keeping were lost. Whistler occasionally worked with Alfred Lemercier and, at the end of his lithographic career, Auguste Clot, but he never developed a close working relationship with any other French printer.\n\nIt is difficult to assess Whistler\u2019s achievement in the area of color lithography. Although he promised Way that he would come to London and work in color, he continually postponed the event. In September 1894 he had written to say that once the problems with the transfer paper were resolved, \u201cwe will go into the coloured work!!\u2014and we will wipe up the place!\u201d Obsessed with secrecy, he added: \u201cLet us keep that dark at present!\u201d There was one frustrated attempt at using multiple stones to create versions of some of the Lyme Regis lithographs in October 1895, and \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d never developed beyond \u201csome experimental sketches and proofs.\u201d The subtlety of his work contrasted dramatically with the brilliant cloisonnist sheets of contemporaries such as Ch\u00e9ret and Toulouse-Lautrec. The spontaneity of line and sophisticated palette found in the lithographs of Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard suggest that they became the true heirs to Whistler\u2019s delicate experiments.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">\u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s Etchings,\u201d Standard, 3 March 1887, p. 3.

Those who have known him can believe they hear him speak. Nevertheless the image only exists as a breath. It is built up by the most rapid pencil strokes\u201d; Duret (1904), p. 124 (translated in Duret (1917), p. 84). Cat. 54 is illustrated in Duret (1904), p. 120.\n\n\u201cA man accustomed to dreaming\u201d; \u201cthis portrait that we see as a reflection, that seems to be viewed in a mirror, seen in the water. It is the poet as he lives in our memory, already receding, outside of time, as he will appear in the future. . . . Thus he isolates himself, distances himself from life, belonging completely to the dream life\u201d; Georges Rodenbach, \u201cNotes sur M.

For in an effortless rise and fall, this creature now in flight, now drowsed in veils, is summoned into the air and seems to hang there\u201d; Bradford Cook, ed., Mallarm\u00e9: Selected Prose Poems, Essays, and Letters (Baltimore, 1956), p. 61. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s essay first appeared in the 1 December 1886 issue of La Revue ind\u00e9pendante.\n\nMondor and Jean-Aubry (note 47), p. 307. Cook (note 47), p. 66, has translated this passage: \u201cThrough her always ultimate veil, she will give you back your concepts in all their nakedness, and silently inscribe your vision as would a Symbol\u2014which she is.\u201d\n\nFor images of Lo\u00efe Fuller, as well as an account of her influence on artists and writers of the time, see Margaret Haile Harris, Lo\u00efe Fuller: Magician of Light, exh. cat.

Or cette transition de sonorit\u00e9 aux tissus (y a-t-il, mieux, \u00e0 une gaze ressemblant que la Musique!) est, uniquement, le sortil\u00e8ge qu\u2019op\u00e8re la Lo\u00efe Fuller, par instinct, avec l\u2019exag\u00e9ration, les retraits, de jupe ou d\u2019aile, instituant un lieu. L\u2019enchant-resse fait l\u2019ambiance, la tire de soi et l\u2019y rentre, par un silence palpit\u00e9 de cr\u00eapes de Chine\u201d (\u201cThe set lies dormant in the orchestra, wealth of imagination; to come forth in a burst, with the spectacle the performer creates through her use of the idea of footlights. But this transition of sounds to fabrics [what better resembles Music than thin fabric!] is, solely, the magic that Lo\u00efe Fuller brings about instinctively, by dramatizing, the flapping, of skirt or of wings, defining a space. The enchantress creates the ambiance, draws it from herself and pulls it back through a silence fluttering with silky crepe fabric\u201d); Mondor and Jean-Aubry (note 47), pp. 308\u201309.\n\nTen O\u2019Clock (1888), p. 28.\n\nTen O\u2019Clock (1888), p. 29.\n\nWhistler\u2019s album of photographs of the Ionides Tanagras is preserved at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow.

Whistler knew the Tanagras in the British Museum, the Louvre, and the Ionides collection (Whistler\u2019s brother was married to Helen Ionides). Several of his sketches are illustrated in Curry (1984), p. 108.\n\nSee Lochnan (note 8), p. 135; Lochnan (1984), pp. 152\u201355.\n\nThis terracotta was published by Leon Heuzey, Conservator of Oriental Antiquities at the Louvre (Les figures antiques de terre cuite du Mus\u00e9e du Louvre [Paris, 1878]), and by Marcus Huish (Greek Terracotta Statuettes [London, 1900]), pi.
