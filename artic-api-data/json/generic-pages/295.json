S. Cleveland. He wrote numerous articles and delivered lectures before professional societies, and by 1874 had expanded his interest and expertise to include art reviews, eventually acquiring a national reputation as a lecturer on art subjects. In 1878, Mr. French became Secretary of the Chicago Academy of Design. The Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, founded in 1879 and reorganized as the Art Institute of Chicago in 1882, named French as its Secretary in 1879; soon after, his title was changed to Director. As the first Director of the Art Institute, Mr. French was in charge of daily operations of both the museum and school, working very closely with Board President Charles L. Hutchinson, an influential figure in shaping the museum's collections. French served as an instructor in the school, teaching a course in Artistic Anatomy for many years. In addition, William M. R. French was a founder and charter member of the American Association of Museums, and served as president of the organization during 1907\u20131908.
