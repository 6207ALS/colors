    "description": "<p>The name of 132 5 is indicative of the way the garments in the clothing line are formally developed. Each piece is made from one single sheet of material; when completed, the piece can fold from a three-dimensional form into a two-dimensional form, and, when worn, assumes yet another dimension, indicated by the \u201c5\u201d in the line\u2019s title. The flat geometric shapes, seen here, are stamped with a metal foil, and while these shapes have no formal relationship to the expanded three-dimensional form, traces of the flat two-dimensional form are evident in iridescent patches throughout the garment.</p>\n",
