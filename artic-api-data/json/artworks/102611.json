    "description": "<p>One of four posts sculpted for the palace of the king (<em>ogoga</em>) of Ikere, this evocative image of the Yoruba concept of a divine ruler is a masterwork of Olowe of Ise. The renowned artist\u2019s dynamic style can be distinguished by the interrelationships between figures, their exaggerated proportions, and the use of open space. The sculptor\u2019s diminutive portrayal of the king suggests his dependence on others, and his crown has been emphasized to evoke the spiritual power residing within it.  The towering image of the king\u2019s senior wife standing behind him underscores her superior status as a guardian of her husband\u2019s interests, endowed with keen political understanding and supernatural knowledge. She would have placed the crown on the king\u2019s head during his enthronement ceremony. The smaller figures at the king\u2019s feet represent one of his junior wives and the flute-playing trickster god Eshu.</p>\n",
