I'm Chicago's Youth Poet Laureate with Young Chicago Authors and this is a poem in reaction to Richard Prince's &quot;Girlfriend.&quot;</p>\n<p>Patricia Frazier: &quot;My fleeting body is a vase of flowers. Love is the brass knuckle. He tells me he loves me. He is sorry. He is dirty water. Regardless, I am still alive. I am still alive on borrowed time. Kitchen under the hot comb. My body, a permmed [ph?] attitude, a cracked vase. Love is a second home, a Plan B, a Planned Parenthood. My body is the vase. The vase is a casket for a rose. Even a dead thing needs a home. Love is the rose handled thorn first. The vase is my house, frame for my brief body. I make sure to leave room for fist, their straining knuckles and my body petals into a casket of water. The water is a dirty man. The man is time I borrowed. My body is a rose, fish out of water. Love is the alternative. The rose is living on borrowed time, but a living thing does what it can to survive. My stem escaped and ran away with the sink. A man tried to catch me and drowned.&quot;</p>\n",
