Ryerson Collection, 1933.1164\n\nOver the course of three trips he made to London between autumn 1899 and spring 1901, Claude Monet began a series of works concentrating on a narrow range of the city\u2019s sites: Waterloo Bridge (cats. 38\u201339), Charing Cross Bridge (cat. 40), and the Houses of Parliament (cat. 41). Although he started off this campaign confidently and methodically, it was not long before feelings of frustration overtook him, something that occurred during nearly every painting trip Monet had embarked on since the 1880s. In early March 1901, for example, he wrote to his second wife, Alice, about his trouble making progress on his London canvases: \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, it is not possible to work on the same paintings two days in succession. I\u2019ll have to limit myself to concentrating only on studies and rough sketches so that I make something of them at my leisure in the studio.\u201d Monet further complained, \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to continue work on a painting. I make alterations to paintings and often ones that were passable are worse for the change. No one would ever guess the trouble I\u2019d gone through to end up with so little.\u201d\n\nThis was not the first time that Monet had visited or painted London. He waited out the Franco-Prussian War there from late summer 1870 to the spring of 1871, having fled France to avoid military service. It was during that initial stay\u2014as exemplified in The Thames below Westminster (fig. 1 [W166])\u2014that he tackled the unique effects of mist and fog that were characteristic of the city. Although he visited London a number of times over the ensuing years, it is difficult to pinpoint Monet\u2019s motivation, after three decades, to return to the city for subject matter.\n\nArt historians typically suggest that these paintings allowed Monet to satisfy a long-postponed desire to paint London\u2019s fog, or that at this specific point in his life and career, it was \u201chis recurrent wish to return to sites that he had painted many years before, as if to test out his art and his eye against his previous paintings and memories.\u201d Indeed, in the 1890s Monet was interested in painting serially the effects of weather conditions, and he revisited a number of motifs and sites that he had painted earlier in his career, including the stacks of wheat (e.g., cats. 28\u201333) and locations along the Channel coast (e.g., The Customs House at Varengeville [cat. 35]) and the banks of the Seine (e.g., Branch of the Seine near Giverny [Mist] [cat. 36]). Art historian Paul Tucker agrees that these paintings reveal the aging Monet\u2019s impulse to reinvent himself with a nod to his own past; he has further suggested that Monet\u2019s return to London was partially instigated by the artist\u2019s frustration toward his homeland in the wake of the Dreyfus Affair and by his ambition to secure a place in art historical memory for himself and the Impressionist agenda.\n\nTucker suggests that Monet, having witnessed at last the delayed acceptance of Impressionism in France, at this precise moment felt compelled to overcome his rivals elsewhere. England was the most important breeding ground for landscape painters in the nineteenth century, as embodied by artists such as John Constable and the more contemporaneous James McNeill Whistler, who was a friend of Monet\u2019s. But above all it was J. M. W. Turner\u2014whose Rain, Steam, and Speed\u2014The Great Western Railway (fig. 2) Monet particularly admired\u2014that Monet contended with. As noted by Tucker, Monet \u201cwas doing battle not just with nature but also with one of the finest painters to have confronted that fickle subject and successfully wrestled it into paint.\u201d\n\nIn terms of volume, Monet\u2019s London project surpassed all his previous series. In total, Monet produced nearly one hundred canvases and more than twenty-five pastels during the campaign. Each time he visited London over the course of the three-year period, Monet stayed at the Savoy, one of the finest hotels in the city located on the north bank of the Thames (see fig. 3). During the first campaign, from September through October 1899, Monet focused on Charing Cross Bridge, which he could see looking to the right from his hotel window. At this time, he may also have begun work on his depictions of Waterloo Bridge, visible to the left. It was only in the course of his second trip, from February 9 to April 5, 1900\u2014upon obtaining permission to paint from the terrace of St. Thomas\u2019s Hospital on the other side of the Thames\u2014that he began painting Westminster Palace, which featured the Houses of Parliament with its imposing towers. Monet continued working on all three motifs during his third visit from late January to March 1901.\n\nAlthough Monet selected a limited number of views for his London series, each work is differentiated by slight yet notable variations. In some depictions of Charing Cross Bridge, Monet included\u2014as in the Art Institute\u2019s canvas\u2014a sliver of the Victoria Embankment at the bottom right. In other versions, such as one in the Baltimore Museum of Art (fig. 4 [W1532]), Monet shifted his gaze further to the left, eliminating the embankment altogether. When depicting the Houses of Parliament, Monet always included the distinctively square-shaped Victoria Tower, but by either zooming in or out or by looking left or right, Monet chose which parts of the Westminster towers appeared along the right edge of the canvas (see fig. 5 [W1609]). Monet was perhaps most experimental in his depictions of Waterloo Bridge\u2014the subject that Monet painted the most (forty-one times in total). In both of the Art Institute\u2019s two versions of the structure, Monet chose to include a varying number of arches and smokestacks. In other views, he tested out more extreme vantage points by changing the location of the bridge on his canvas (fig. 6 [W1584]).\n\nOn his second trip, Monet worked from his room at the Savoy for the first part of the day, and in late afternoon, he would go across the river to the hospital to paint the Houses of Parliament at sunset. Limited by the fleeting weather effects at different times of day, Monet began \u201cstudies and rough sketches\u201d that he intended to rework in his Giverny studio rather than aiming for executing fully developed compositions on the spot. Nearing the end of his second trip, he described his frenzied working method to his wife Alice, and he expressed regret about the time he felt he had wasted: \u201cJust imagine, I\u2019m bringing back eight full crates, that\u2019s eighty canvases, isn\u2019t it frightening? And if I\u2019d had the right idea in the first place and had started afresh each time the effect changed, I would have made more progress, instead of which I dabbled around and altered paintings that were giving me trouble.\u201d\n\nBringing the canvases back to his Giverny studio, however, would not prove to be an antidote; two years later, Monet was still struggling with them. Writing in late March 1903 to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, about the plans for an upcoming exhibition, Monet anxiously described his predicament: \u201cI can\u2019t send you a single London painting since for this kind of work I need to be able to see them all, and quite honestly none of them are completely finished. I\u2019m working on them all, or on a number of them anyway, and don\u2019t yet know how many I\u2019ll be able to exhibit, since what I\u2019m doing is very delicate.\u201d Just a few days later, he confessed to long-time supporter the art critic Gustave Geffroy that \u201cmy mistake has been to want to retouch them; one so quickly loses a good impression . . . those attempts and lay-ins could have been shown; but now that I have retouched all of them, I must at all costs go through to the end.\u201d\n\nUnwilling to part with his London paintings, Monet was forced to delay exhibiting them until spring 1904. Indeed, hints of his battle with these canvases are evident throughout the Art Institute\u2019s four London canvases. To varying degrees, the pictures all reveal signs of being worked and reworked, for the surfaces of each include texture from brushstrokes that Monet applied in earlier painting sessions and subsequently painted over. It is impossible to determine precisely when he made these changes, however, for the dates that Monet assigned to his London paintings range from 1899 to 1905. And, as revealed by the Art Institute\u2019s Houses of Parliament and Charing Cross Bridge, there is evidence that Monet presumably changed his mind about when he considered these paintings finished. In Houses of Parliament, Monet signed the painting at lower right, but subsequently reworked the water in that area, covering the signature, which required him to re-sign the painting virtually on top of where it originally appeared (fig. 7). Charing Cross Bridge reveals a more significant change; it was once signed at bottom left (fig. 8), but Monet later obliterated his autograph and re-signed and dated it at bottom right, the location where he consistently inscribed most of the Charing Cross Bridge paintings that included part of Victoria Embankment at bottom right (see Signature in the technical report).\n\nAside from changing the placement of his signature, Monet made major compositional changes to Charing Cross Bridge. Transmitted-light imaging reveals that the main vertical elements in the painting\u2014the bridge supports, the Houses of Parliament, and the embankment\u2014were moved further to the right in the final composition (see Paint Layer in the technical report). It also suggests that the Art Institute\u2019s version may have originally been laid in much more like the Baltimore painting (fig. 4), which is the clearest, most complete view of Charing Cross Bridge in the series, and includes Westminster Bridge and the Lambeth suspension bridge in the background. In the Chicago picture, the faint presence of Westminster Bridge is indicated, but technical images suggest that the bridge was initially more pronounced and expansive, suggesting Monet began this painting as a wider and more precise panoramic vista that he then reworked and obscured as he developed the enveloppe of fog.\n\nTechnical imaging also indicates that significant changes appear in the Art Institute\u2019s Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather, in which Monet dramatically altered the angle of the bridge and the number of arches, in addition to varying the position of the smokestacks (fig. 9). The Art Institute\u2019s other Waterloo Bridge picture, Waterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect, on the other hand, does not show evidence of pentimenti (fig. 10), although this is perhaps due to densely applied paint, making it difficult to see if Monet made changes. What is particularly unique about Sunlight Effect is that the canvas Monet used was not one of the ones he brought with him and was probably one that he purchased there. The artist was running out of supplies; in March 1900, he wrote to his wife that \u201cthe only shortage I have is of canvases, since it\u2019s the only way to achieve something, get a picture going for every kind of weather, every colour harmony, it\u2019s the only way . . . I\u2019m not lacking for enthusiasm as you can see, given that I have something like 65 canvases covered with paint and I\u2019ll be needing more since the place is quite out of the ordinary; so I\u2019m going to order some more canvases.\u201d Indeed, as has been identified in recent technical examinations, this canvas\u2014bearing traces of the stamp of Lechertier Barbe Ltd., a French canvas supplier with a branch in London at the time\u2014is the coarsest of all thirty-three paintings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (see Support in the technical report).\n\nWhen Monet eventually exhibited thirty-seven works from his London series at Durand-Ruel\u2019s Paris gallery in 1906, they were a great success, both financially and critically. Durand-Ruel alone purchased eighteen of the works at the outset of the exhibition; the show was extended for three additional days; and there was discussion of staging a similar exhibition in London, although it never materialized. Critics, too, were hugely enthusiastic, and Monet was certainly pleased that a number of them mentioned the connection between his works and those of Turner. As described by critic Gustave Kahn, for example, \u201cone might place certain Monets beside certain Turners. One would thereby compare two branches . . . of Impressionism, or rather . . . it would integrate two moments in the history of visual sensitivity.\u201d But as evidenced in the Art Institute\u2019s paintings from the London series, this acclaim was hard won. Monet labored intensively over these compositions and struggled to balance his direct, firsthand observations of the motifs with his desire to finalize his compositions and meticulously harmonize color effects in the studio setting.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather (W1557) corresponds to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 676\u201377, cat. 1557 (ill.).

See Grace Seiberling, Monet in London, exh. cat. (High Museum of Art, 1988), p. 86. Daniel Wildenstein mentions this about a number of London paintings, including Charing Cross Bridge (1902; National Museum Wales, Cardiff [W1529]), Waterloo Bridge, Sunlight Effect in the Fog (1903; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa [W1573]), Houses of Parliament, Symphony in Rose (1900/01; private collection, Japan [W1599]), Houses of Parliament, Symphony in Blue (1903; High Museum of Art, Atlanta [W1601]), and Houses of Parliament, Fog Effect (1903; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W1609]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nIn addition to the Art Institute\u2019s painting, the paintings of Charing Cross Bridge that included part of Victoria Embankment at bottom right and that were also dated at bottom right include Charing Cross Bridge, London (1899; Shelburne [Vt.] Museum [W1521]), Charing Cross Bridge (1899; Santa Barbara Museum of Art [W1522]), Charing Cross Bridge (1899; Murauchi Art Museum, Hachioji, Japan [1523]), Charing Cross Bridge (1899; bought Sotheby\u2019s, London, Nov. 28, 1989, lot 28 [1524]), Charing Cross Bridge (Overcast Day) (1900; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston [W1526]), Charing Cross Bridge (1903; sold, Christie\u2019s, New York, Nov. 7, 1995, lot 27 [W1528]), Charing Cross Bridge (1902; National Museum Wales, Cardiff [W1529]), and Cleopatra\u2019s Needle and Charing Cross Bridge (1899\u20131901; Monsieur and Mme Mohammed Mahmoud Khalil Museum, Cairo [W1543]). The anomalies to this rule are Charing Cross Bridge in London (c. 1902; National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo [W1525]), which is signed at lower left and undated, Charing Cross Bridge (c. 1900; Indianapolis Museum of Art [W1530]), which is unsigned, and Cleopatra\u2019s Needle and Charing Cross Bridge (1899\u20131901; bought Sotheby\u2019s, London, June 26, 1990, lot 25 [W1544]), which has an estate stamp; these all have an unfinished quality. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nTransmitted-light imaging suggests that the embankment originally protruded even further into the space that is now occupied by the Thames. Wildenstein suggests that Monet must have begun the canvases that include the embankment in autumn 1899, for it was Monet\u2019s only visit that occurred at a time of year when trees would have been in leaf; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 653. Its inclusion creates a form similar to those jutted lobes of land that captivated Monet\u2019s attention in his paintings of the Channel coast (see Cliff Walk at Pourville [cat. 19] and The Customs House at Varengeville [cat. 35]).\n\nDaniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 661.\n\nMonet to Alice Monet, Mar. 18, 1900, translated in Richard Kendall, Monet by Himself: Paintings, Drawings, Pastels, Letters (Macdonald Orbis, 1989), p. 189; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 4, Peintures, 1899\u20131926 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1985), p. 345, letter 1532.\n\nFor more on Lechertier Ltd., see Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 30\u201332, 104; and the National Portrait Gallery, London, \u201cBritish Artists\u2019 Suppliers, 1650\u20131950,\u201d http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/directory-of-suppliers.php.
