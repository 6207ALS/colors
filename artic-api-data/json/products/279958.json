    "description": "<p>In ancient China (2000\u2013221 b.c.) elaborate bronze vessels were used for rituals involving cooking, drinking, and serving food.</p><p>This fascinating book\u00a0not only examines the cultural practices surrounding these objects in their original context, but it also provides the first in-depth study tracing the\u00a0tradition of collecting these bronzes in China. Essays by international experts delve into the concerns of the specialized culture that developed\u00a0 around the vessels and the significant influence this culture, with its emphasis on the concept of antiquity, had on broader Chinese society.</p><p>While\u00a0focusing especially on bronze collections of the 18th and 19th centuries, this wide-ranging catalogue also touches on the ways in which contemporary\u00a0 artists continue to respond to the complex legacy of these objects. Packed with stunning photographs of exquisitely crafted vessels,\u00a0<em>Mirroring China\u2019s\u00a0Past</em>\u00a0is an enlightening investigation into how the role of ancient bronzes has evolved throughout Chinese history.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>296 pages with 260 colored illustrations.</p><p><span>9 1/2\" x 12\" x 2\".</span></p>",
