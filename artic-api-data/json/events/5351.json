    "description": "<p>Join Senju\u2014a contemporary proponent of Nihonga, traditional Japanese painting\u2014as he discusses his signature<em> Waterfall </em>works.</p><p>Senju created the enchanting painted panels <a href=\"/exhibitions/9824/senju-s-waterfalls-for-chicago\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on view at the Art Institute</a> specifically for the museum\u2019s Gallery 109, the space designed by architect And\u014d Tadao. Thinking of the exhibition as a collaboration between himself and the architect across time, Senju tailored the scale and lighting to best suit this distinctive space. Variable lighting in this installation reveals this painting's two dramatically different \"faces,\" as Senju calls them. Under regular incandescent lighting, the work accentuates express the force and motion of falling water. Under black light, the painted waterfalls glow a bright, ethereal blue that activates the entire gallery.</p><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.
