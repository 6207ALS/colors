    "description": "<p>This remarkable relief embroidery once decorated the back of a chasuble, the sleeveless overgarment worn by the priest celebrating Mass. The chasuble itself would have been made from a rich silk. The congregation saw this lifelike Crucifixion when the preist consecrated the bread and wine of the Eucharist; at that moment the preist faced the altar with his back to the congregation. The Virgin and saint John the Evangelist are prepresented at the foot of the cross, Saint Peter with his key and Saint Paul with his sword fill its arms, while the top of the embroidery forms an image of the Trinity.</p>\n",
