Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897 (see Technical Overview). So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. Gauguin hoped to use the mimeograph machine to print images and text simultaneously (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text of the August, September, and October 1899 issues were rendered partially illegible due to the broken lines and uneven printing. In this and later issues of the journal, he integrated wood-block prints, such as the headpiece, to improve the clarity of his illustrations. In another copy of the November 1899 issue of Le sourire in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, he used A Pig, a Dwarf, Flowers, and Leaves (cat. 109 [Kornfeld 60 B]) as the headpiece.\n\nFor this vignette Gauguin used the back of the same block on which he carved Mahana atua (cat. 80) four years earlier. On the same side, he also carved a second vignette, Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available woodblock was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers onto his prints. The block is extant, in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 110.2).\n\nAn impression of Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird adorns the front page of this issue. The irregularity of the impression appears to be a result of selective adhesion of the ink to the block. An excess of linseed oil is indicated by the reticulated pattern of ink deposition and the strike-through of oil on the verso of the sheet as well as onto the sheet facing it. Here the artist\u2019s signature, carved into the matrix, is faintly legible in the lower left.\n\nThe monogram and title block below it on the last page were printed in a thick layer of black ink that contained a significant amount of linseed oil as well. This is evidenced by the golden-brown halos present around the printed lines as well as a significant amount of oil strike-through on the verso and onto the facing the page. The rest of the issue was printed in brownish-black ink applied through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself was responsible for the grainy appearance of the text (see Technical Overview).\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n397 \u00d7 513 mm (full sheet); 397 \u00d7 256 mm (folded sheet); 32 mm (diameter of printed monogram); 24 \u00d7 94 mm (title block); 105 \u00d7 187 mm (headpiece)\n\nThere is no conservation documentation in the Art Institute\u2019s files, nor any record of previous conservation treatment.\n\nThe issue is in fair condition. It was mended along the edges and central folds but it cannot be determined when this was done.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
