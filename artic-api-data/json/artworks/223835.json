    "description": "<p>Art Shay is one of Chicago\u2019s great photojournalists. With more than 25,000 published photographs\u2014including more than 1,000 magazine covers\u2014Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.</p>\n<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs\u2014of an American military air disaster\u2014were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay\u2019s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.</p>\n",
