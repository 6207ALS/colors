    "copy": " In a world that\u2019s been overwhelmed by sadness and stress, I find an instant energy boost whenever I work with students and emerging museum professionals. As project manager for the museum\u2019s internship and fellowship programs, I\u2019ve had the privilege of meeting and learning from so many new voices in the art museum field. A lot of our intern cohort is too humble to admit it, but I\u2019m positive that the future of the art world is in better hands because of them. To share this sense of joy in getting to know our interns, I interviewed Gabriela Maria Trinidad-Perez who is interning with the Youth and Family Programs team, JB Fry who is with Exhibition Design, Aliv\u00e9 Piliado with Modern and Contemporary, Mimosa Shah with Photography and Media, and Doyun Kim with Arts of Asia. I hope that they inspire you as much as they inspire me. \u2014 Rachel Joy Echiverri Rowland, project manager for interns and fellows, Academic Engagement and Research   Rachel: Thank you all for letting me interview you today! To start off, could you please share what first inspired you to apply for this internship? Aliv\u00e9: I first visited the museum 10 years ago back when I hadn\u2019t really discovered the museum world. I remember thinking to myself, \u201cWow, it would be so great just to be working here.\u201d JB: I'm an installation artist and seeing the H\u00e9lio Oiticica exhibition was a pivotal moment for me. Rachel: That was such a good show! JB: I loved it. The flow of the exhibition and all of its design qualities first inspired me to seek an internship at the museum. Mimosa: Unlike Aliv\u00e9 and JB, I didn\u2019t have an art background before coming to the museum, but I absolutely love photography and wanted to learn more about the field in general.   Rachel: There\u2019s a misconception that internships at the museum largely consist of meaningless errands. Could you talk more about what your roles at the museum actually entail? Gabriela: I\u2019m both a mentor for the Teen Council and work collaboratively with educators to create programs for teens and the public. I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s not just about creating programming, but understanding how community work can be involved in museum educational spaces. Doyun: I\u2019m conducting research specifically about the Korean art collection. It's really interesting to learn about its provenance, to see how it is represented and how international audiences engage with it. Mimosa: I\u2019m also conducting research, but on Pan-Africanism for the Photography and Media department. I\u2019ve been involved in what feels like a global effort to create what will ultimately become an exhibition on Pan-African art. I\u2019ve also been writing a lot of blog articles on what interests me \u2014 my latest one was about postcards ! Rachel: You\u2019re a great writer, Mimosa! I\u2019m so happy you\u2019re able to share your talent.   JB: My internship in Exhibition Design consists a lot of picking out paint colors, though I\u2019ve been designing the flow of gallery spaces, working with art on display, collaborating with curators . . . Gabriela: You\u2019re really creating an environment! Doyun: I think it\u2019s really cool to understand the behind-the-scenes aspect of creating exhibitions. Aliv\u00e9: I helped with installing Ray Johnson c/o , and I witnessed how much work was put into designing the space firsthand. Mimosa: I literally saw how people designed and built up walls for our photography galleries to create spaces to hold art. They had to adjust so much! JB: There\u2019s really a lot of thought and detail that goes into exhibition design. I thought I was a perfectionist, but when I started this internship I realized that there were others who were more meticulous.   Rachel: Speaking of teamwork, a few of you talked about how collaborative your work has been at the museum. What is it like to work with your departments? Aliv\u00e9: I had a very kind welcome and immediately felt part of the team. Often there is this misconception in the art world that curators have this unattainable aura, but in my experience, they have been very communicative, kind, and open to sharing and exchanging knowledge. Gabriela: I agree with you, Aliv\u00e9. I always feel included. My mentors take my opinion very seriously, and I have an active role in all the work our department does. When I work on a project, I feel like I\u2019m coming into this and I\u2019m not just grabbing coffee for people.   Rachel: Is there anything else that surprised you about working at the museum? JB: It's so interdepartmental and interdisciplinary. I didn\u2019t think that I would work with many people outside of Exhibition Design, but it\u2019s wonderful because we\u2019re all able to share and learn from each other\u2019s niche knowledge. Right now I\u2019m working with Arts of the Americas curators and the museum\u2019s director in their gallery refresh. Doyun: My view of curators changed. The Arts of Asia curators work hard to balance the needs of their department with their own research and also carefully strategize how to best represent the cultures that they\u2019re in charge of. I did not expect the role of diplomat to be so pronounced. Gabriela: I went to a Brave Space meeting last summer that focused on queer identity, where people across the museum got to meet and support each other. As a queer person, I only meet other queer people who emphasize only doing queer-related things, so it\u2019s nice to hear from queer folks whose work is not siloed based on identity. It was also great to meet older LGBQT-identifying people who\u2019ve worked at the Art Institute for a while and to speak from my own perspective as someone new to the museum. Aliv\u00e9: Everyone at the museum is amazing. It\u2019s fun to get to know our cohort as well because we have a lot of knowledge to share amongst ourselves. JB: I really enjoy seeing how excited we all get when we share our projects. M imosa: I love learning about what all of us are working on when we meet.   Rachel: If you could give one piece of advice to a future intern at the Art Institute, what would it be? Aliv\u00e9: Keep asking questions and be very open to hearing feedback. You\u2019ll be amazed at how much you get to learn from each other. Gabriela: Say \u201chi\u201d to everyone. It\u2019s such a collaborative work environment, and I\u2019ve learned how to engage with so many different people already. JB: Don\u2019t feel intimidated. It\u2019s hard to be young in a museum, but everyone is so friendly and genuinely want to meet and work with you. Mimosa: Stay curious. As an older person, I can easily be cynical and jaded but I think there\u2019s a lot to be said about being open and curious, especially when a field is still new to you. Doyun: Focus on what you want to do rather than what you can do. When I first came to the museum, I had this pressure that I had to do well right away. But after one month, I realized that there\u2019s so much yet to learn. I feel comfortable asking questions and requesting information on anything new I want to learn in my internship. Rachel: This is all such important advice. Thank you so much for sharing and spending time with me today. As we close our interview, I\u2019m wondering if you have any suggestions of artwork for visitors to check out. Gabriela: In this internship I\u2019ve learned to really love American decorative arts, particularly works by Frank Lloyd Wright and of course the Hartwell Memorial Window . I didn\u2019t know much about this part of the collection before working with Youth and Families. Doyun: I love the Ando Gallery because the space itself feels like an artwork. When you\u2019re in the space and look at the objects or screens on display, you can see shadows of people walking behind you and their reflections while looking at the same artwork. It\u2019s self-reflective in so many ways. Aliv\u00e9: It\u2019s hard to pick a favorite, but there\u2019s an artwork in the Modern Wing that I\u2019m always drawn to: Alice Rahon\u2019s Self-Portrait and Autobiography . Rahon has always been an artist I admire.   Mimosa: I am so jazzed by the Ray Johnson c/o exhibition and learning about what that collection meant to so many after all of these years. Aliv\u00e9: I worked on that exhibition! It\u2019s really an incredible collection. JB: I am absolutely obsessed with the Subscribe: Artists and Alternative Magazines, 1970-1995 exhibit. There is so much archival material on subject matter that I love. One of my favorite pieces by Vaginal Davis is on display in that exhibition and I helped design the pedestal for it. I mean, how cool is that, right?   We recognize the need to rejuvenate and better support the ever-changing art museum world \u2014 a large part of this work comes from encouraging emerging voices in the field.
