    "description": "<p>Narasimha was one of the <em>avatars</em> of Vishnu, a man-lion form that he assumed in order to help his beloved devotee Prahad, the son of the demon king Hiranyakashipu. He had outlawed worship of Vishnu and tormented the prince for his faith. The king\u2019s devotions were dedicated to the god Brahma, who rewarded him by granting that he could not be killed by man or beast, inside or outside, by day or night. Here, Vishnu is shown in his Narasimha incarnation (neither man nor beast), emerging from a pillar (neither inside nor outside) at twilight (neither day nor night) to disembowel Hiranyakashipu. The story had particular resonance among the kings and warriors of Pala eastern India.</p>\n",
