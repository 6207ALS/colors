A.D. 96\u201398) is known as the first of the \u201cfive good emperors.\u201d The obverse inscription solemnly declares the titles and powers voted to Nerva by the Senate: Imperator, Caesar, Augustus, pontifex maximus, holder of tribunician power, consul for the third time, and pater patriae. He focused his paternal attention mainly on Italy, though the restoration of some foreign colonies and a successful military campaign in Pannonia show his interest in matters outside the Italian heartland. His genuine efforts to sustain the urban poor were later institutionalized by his successor Trajan as the alimenta. Nerva worked to reduce the cost of living and help farming and industry, and supported social welfare and education. Already in his midsixties when he became emperor, Nerva called upon the Spanish general M. Ulpius Trajan to keep the troops in line. To balance the dangerous and restive power of the Praetorian Guard, Nerva subsequently adopted Trajan as his heir, a move that was so successful that several future \u201cgood\u201d emperors chose their successors in similar fashion, looking for competence and experience rather than family ties.\n\nThe reverse of this coin presents the goddess Liberty with an inscription that refers to the \u201cliberty of the people.\u201d Liberty holds a scepter and from her hand dangles a pileus, a cap associated with the manumission of slaves. The image is carried over from the coinage of Vespasian, who had borrowed it from Galba (d. A.D. 69), who in turn chose it to contrast with Nero\u2019s tyrannical rule. This image thus may advertise Nerva\u2019s willingness to work with a \u201cliberated\u201d Senate. But the type may also be related to Nerva\u2019s concern for the poor and orphaned children of Rome, since \u201cliberty,\u201d \u201csecurity,\u201d and the distribution of food in the annona and alimenta are associated types on some coins of Nerva\u2019s successors Trajan and Hadrian. Liberty may therefore be construed as the right of the people of Rome to be free from the \u201cterror of poverty.\u201d  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">On the development of the alimenta, see Rawson, \u201cChildren as Cultural Symbols.\u201d\n\nBoruch, \u201cGalba\u2019s Propaganda Motifs,\u201d p. 74.\n\nUnder the Republic, annona was the supply of grain to Rome. Once subject to free market prices, by the second century B.C. (after the dramatic changes initiated by the Punic Wars) the price of grain was controlled so that the poor could afford it; under Pompey and Caesar free grain was also distributed to fixed numbers of poor Romans (the cura annona). Under Augustus the cura annona was extended to 200,000 Romans. Annona can also refer to the tax raised specifically to supply the armies with grain. The goddess Annona is the personification of the grain supply. The alimenta were funds for the feeding of poor children in Rome. There were privately funded alimentae, but those set up by men and (especially) women of the imperial family became state institutions. The funds usually came from the interest on land mortgages.\n\nRawson, \u201cChildren as Cultural Symbols,\u201d p. 34.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 46 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Nerva, A.D. 97\n\n</section>",
