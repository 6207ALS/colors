Drawn with black and white chalks on a somewhat faded blue paper, this sheet was undoubtedly a preparatory study for one of the 18 known paintings of the Supper at Emmaus produced by this Genoese-born artist and his workshop, probably during his later years working in Venice. For a Capuchin monk like Strozzi, the story of Christ\u2019s appearance to two strangers on the road to Emmaus offered a chance to portray his divinity in very human terms.</p>\n",
