    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value='\"{\"' data-sheets-userformat='\"{\"'>The Tripod Dishy Earrings are hand carved in wax and cast in recycled sterling silver. Each piece is heated to a bright white sterling, with a high polished edge. This is the first piece of jewelry created by Sarah Richardson in the Pod Collection, over 20 years ago. It is still a timeless classic today. Inspired by nature and botanicals, Sarah\u2019s collection ranges from everyday simple to extraordinary. The organic nature of her jewelry finds balance and symmetry through repetition. Each piece is finely crafted in California using traditional metalsmithing techniques in precious metals. </span></p><p><span data-sheets-value='\"{\"' data-sheets-userformat='\"{\"'>Size:\u00a0 0.75 in.
