    "description": "<p>>Colson Whitehead\u2019s <em>The Underground Railroad</em> tells the story of Cora, who like so many slaves before her, runs toward freedom. In this telling, however, the \u201cunderground railroad\u201d is not a metaphor, but an actual subterranean train. Whitehead topped <em>The New York Times</em> bestseller list and won the National Book Award and the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for how he brilliantly re-creates the unique terrors of black people before the Civil War, a narrative that weaves the saga of America from the brutal importation of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of today. Pulitzer Prize-winning <em>Chicago Tribune</em> columnist Mary Schmich joins Whitehead in conversation.</p><p>>A book signing will follow this program.</p><p>><em>This program is presented in partnership </em><em>with </em><em >the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Humanities Festival. </em></p><p>>*Ticketholders for this event may enter the museum with their event ticket beginning at 2:30.
