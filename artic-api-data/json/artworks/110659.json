    "inscriptions": "A Note on the Inscriptions: (Notes by Muheb Esmat, 7/2016)\n\nThere are two different sets of inscriptions in this silk piece, one is written horizontally on the yellow/gold background adjoined to the red and the second set is positioned vertically on the blue background. The text looks to be Arabic writing but really hard to read because of the age of the fabric and how some colors look to have diminished over time. Comparing this piece for the AIC collection to the picture from Abegg-Stiftung collection, I strongly believe that this might be part of the work they have since all the patterns match perfectly across both works. \n\nThe words \u201cbaraka\u201d and \u201cmalik\u201d appear on the inscription but not much else can be read. There also seems to a Spanish name (transliterated into Arabic). Perhaps this name could have referred to the original owner of this silk.",
