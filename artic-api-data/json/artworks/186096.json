    "description": "<p>While this watercolor may initially appear completely abstract, upon closer inspection a figure emerges from the layered forms. A body has been shaped from parallel lines, which give the appearance of exposed musculature. The figure appears trapped by the approaching darkness on all sides, and a single drop of blood falls from his mouth as another threatens to fall from above. The pain of the subject is palpable: the cross on the left, a symbol of the Crucifixion, enhances this sense of suffering.</p>\n",
