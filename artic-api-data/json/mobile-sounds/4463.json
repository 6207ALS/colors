    "transcript": "<p>&lt;narrator&gt;</p>\n<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: Well I love this sculpture from Eastern India that shows the Buddha standing. Around the central figure, you'll see other very important seminal events in his life.</p>\n<p>&lt;narrator&gt;</p>\n<p>Rob Linroth: The most important one is the enlightenment that happened at Bodh Gaya and that's right next to his upper right him. You see Buddha who's reaching down to touch the earth. If we just cross over and look at the paired standing Buddha on the viewers' right side, you see that there's a tiny little elephant and that is an indicator that this is the miracle where a mad elephant goes raging through the streets. As soon as the mad elephant saw the Buddha, it was immediately tamed and it sort of sat down and offered reverence to the Buddha. And directly above that, is a seated Buddha who is actually holding a bowl in the two hands of his lap and if you look very, very closely just to the lower right of the Buddha is a tiny monkey and this is the.. a miracle where a monkey offered the Buddha honey and interestingly enough, the monkey.. once the Buddha accepts his offering, he immediately dives into a well to commit suicide because he knew that his karma would be such that he would be reborn as a human in his next life.</p>\n<p>Madhuvanti Ghose: So each of these images of the Buddha will have a little clue that a Buddhist layperson will be able to read and understand the significance of that episode within the Buddha's life.</p>\n",
