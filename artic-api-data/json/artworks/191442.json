    "description": "<p>Trained as an architect, Gordon Matta-Clark gave spaces affected by blight or gentrification a second life as sculptures by cutting geometric voids into condemned buildings with a chainsaw. For <em>Circus (Caribbean Orange)</em>, commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA), Matta-Clark carved three spherical volumes (like a three-ring circus) from a three-story townhouse adjacent to the MCA\u2019s former location, before the building was transformed into additional gallery space. Matta-Clark printed slides of the resulting space and then cut into the photographs to produce collages like this one. He explains that these photocollages \u201ctry and capture the \u2018all around\u2019 experience of the piece\u201d and are \u201can approximation of this kind of ambulatory \u2018getting to know\u2019 what the space is about.\u201d</p>\n",
