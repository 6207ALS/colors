    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Northern Italian artist Moroni painted this splendid portrait in about 1552. It emphasizes the high status of a young Italian nobleman, Gian Lodovico Madruzzo. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: He's shown in a rich interior with a dramatically patterned tile floor and a wonderfully articulated marble background and a draped green velvet cloth which set off the scale of his figure wonderfully. The patterning of columns in the marble background both suggests a kind of palace setting, and it also serves to isolate the head of the sitter in a wonderful and powerful way.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Gian Lodovico's family were leading figures in the Counter Reformation movement, an effort to reform and reinvigorate the Catholic church in response to the challenge of the Protestant Reformation. He himself would later become Prince Bishop of Trent in Northern Italy. When this portrait was painted, he was only 20 years-old.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: It's fascinating to think that this is such a young man who's being presented in this role of authority with his standing figure, the commanding gesture of the hand that seems to control the large hunting dog, the elegant gloves that he holds in the other hand, and his long, elegant somber clerical robes.</p>\n",
