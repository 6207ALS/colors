Aiming to reform the contemporary taste for historicized revival styles, the Aesthetic Movement embraced new sources of inspiration such as Japanese design, which provided an exemplary vehicle for fusing aesthetics deemed exotic in the Western world with realistic depictions of nature. Four silver bowls by the Gorham Manufacturing Company, marked with the company\u2019s date letter B, for 1869, are arguably the earliest known works by an American silver firm decorated with Japanese-influenced motifs. The fans, butterflies, bamboo, and Aesthetic-style borders engraved on those bowls would reappear in Gorham\u2019s Japanese flatware pattern, which was introduced in 1871. An 1876 Gorham publication lauds the virtues of Japanese aesthetics:\n\nThe Japanesque style of decoration is justly popular, for it is the outcome of a careful study of Nature. The ordinary Japanese forms for design are not great in number, yet they constantly recur in great and endless variety, and always with fresh and pleasing novelty of combination. Coming straight from Nature, the fountain head of all good design, it is perhaps one of the chief reasons why it impresses us with a freshness which gives great effect with few lines.\n\nWhat was seen and appreciated as the naturalistic character of Japanese art was adopted and promoted by American silver companies to the extent that a source did not actually need to derive from another hemisphere, but instead could be found in a company\u2019s environs. For Gorham that was Rhode Island, nicknamed the \u201cOcean State,\u201d because it is surrounded by over four hundred miles of coastline between Narragansett and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1884 the firm launched a line of silver and gilded flatware known as Narragansett, which took its name from one of the Native American tribes living along the Rhode Island coast, which, in turn, lent its name to the state\u2019s Atlantic inlet on the north side of Rhode Island Sound, known as Narragansett Bay. Looking as if they were plucked from the ocean itself, examples of Narragansett silverware are encrusted with shells, sand, crabs, and strands of seaweed tangled with fish. Indeed, the casts\u2014often taken from living specimens\u2014are no mere embellishment but rather the elements that make up the objects themselves. To date, thirteen types of Narragansett flatware\u2014from salad servers to berry spoons\u2014have been identified, all covered in ornament that the 1884 Gorham catalogue describes as \u201ctaking its cue in matter of design from the relics of the seashore.\u201d\n\nThe scallop, bivalve, cockle, oyster, quahog, mussel, and clam shells that appear in many of the Narragansett objects also inspired a related line of smallwares, which include salts and serving dishes for olives and nuts. The Art Institute\u2019s dishes are among these works. Although their particular form does not appear in the Gorham catalogues, a model identified as \u201cSalted Almond Dish 765,\u201dfeaturing a similar design and identical dimensions, was first shown in the 1888 Gorham catalogue. Like those of the servers, the body and feet of the almond dish are seemingly caked with sand, the main difference being that the almond dish features two shell feet versus these dishes\u2019 single shell foot. Another model, which is approximately half the size yet closely related in form\u2014it has a single foot\u2014initially appeared in the 1889 Gorham catalogue as no. 1990. This pair of dishes exemplifies silver purely inspired by marine imagery, its naturalistic appearance reflective of the Japanesque design influence that characterized the American Aesthetic Movement.  \nElizabeth A.
