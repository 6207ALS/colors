    "description": "<p>Eve Sonneman became known for works that combine straight photography with a more conceptual practice. From around 1969 to 1974, she produced black-and-white diptychs, searching her film rolls to find two adjacent frames marked by a shift in gesture or evidence of the passage of time and then printing them together. The doubled images undermine the predatory idea of the perfect \u201cshot\u201d as well as the argument that truth is located in any single moment. Hugh Edwards purchased three photographs from Sonneman in 1969, the year she completed her BFA from the University of New Mexico and before she had begun exhibiting internationally.</p>\n",
