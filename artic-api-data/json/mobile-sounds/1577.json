    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This expansive, verdant landscape was painted by the French artist \u00c9douard Vuillard in 1899. It was one of a pair of paintings intended to decorate the interior of a Parisian apartment. The owner, Vuillard\u2019s patron, also collected old tapestries. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And I think this painting very much fits into that aesthetic of tapestry. It has a kind of woven quality. It\u2019s made with zones of color, big broad horizontal bands. He\u2019s also adding this garland on three of the sides so that you sense a kind of a swag effect like this is tapestry, this is a fabric that is hanging down and has a kind of a give to it. But then he\u2019s done something very clever at the bottom and the painting is called \u201cWindow Overlooking the Woods\u201d. He\u2019s created a kind of a faux windowsill. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re looking out on the undulating hills that go right up to the top where there\u2019s just a little band of the horizon.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Vuillard based his decorative arrangement of abstract pattern forms on a landscape he knew well: the valley outside Paris where his sister lived.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And he\u2019s painting as if he\u2019s looking out the window, maybe even from her house, or looking onto her. There\u2019s a woman in the window, framed by the window with red geraniums, and the geraniums catch your eye on the left-hand side of the painting. And you wonder is that his sister? Who is that? Does he know her? It\u2019s kind of an intimist\u2019s view on this grand panoramic scale.</p>\n",
