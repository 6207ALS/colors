    "description": "<p>Beginning in 1885, John Singer Sargent increasingly spent time painting outside, exploring the techniques and subjects of Impressionism, inspired by a growing friendship with Claude Monet. Executing this work in rural England (or possibly Nice in southern France), Sargent experimented with distinctly broken brushwork and a high-keyed palette. <em>Thistles</em> captures the tangled movement of the windblown plants in light and shadow. This landscape composition is remarkably abstract: the dynamic patterning of the thistles asserts the flatness of the picture plane more so than any sense of depth. Sargent continued painting en plein air throughout his life, a practice that provided needed respite from his busy schedule as an acclaimed portraitist.</p>\n",
