    "description": "<p>Cesar Oiticica Filho\u2019s first film is a visually striking found-footage documentary about the filmmaker\u2019s uncle, the Brazilian artist H\u00e9lio Oiticica (1937\u20131980). Through rare archival audio and visual material, the documentary allows Oiticica himself to narrate his life and expound upon his art in his own words. The artist\u2019s commentary guides us through his artistic development and expansive political and aesthetic interests, from his modernist paintings and sculptures in the 1960s to his expanded cinema installations and slide show environments of the 1970s, and from the favelas and the lively street life of Rio, New York and London to samba schools and the Tropic\u00e1lia cultural movement. </p><p>Oiticica Filho introduces the screening, which is presented in association with the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibition/h-lio-oiticica-organize-delirium\"><em>H\u00e9lio Oiticica: To Organize Delirium</em></a>.</p>",
