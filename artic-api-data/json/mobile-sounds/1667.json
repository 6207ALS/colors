    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: The first thing you may notice about this early 16th century manger scene is how crowded it is.  Besides the holy family and the adoring shepherds, a multitude of half-naked, music-making angels have gathered to celebrate the miraculous birth of Christ, as related in the Gospel according to St. Luke.  This lively panel comes from the Amsterdam workshop of Jacob von Oostsanen.  It actually depicts two different moments in the Biblical narrative.  In the background, an angel in red hovers in the sky to announce the birth of Jesus to shepherds watching their flocks.  On the left, the shepherds are congregated around the Christ Child.  The setting shows both a humble wooden stable and what looks like the ruins of an elaborate palace.  The palace is probably a reference to the Gospel's tracing of Christ's ancestry back to the Old Testament's King David.  Throughout the panel there is evidence of subtle reworking by someone's hand, perhaps the artist himself.  What began as a linear, late Gothic-style picture was revised to bring a softer elegance to the holy figures.  One particularly charming detail that the x-ray studies have revealed is that that eyes of both mother and child were repainted.  They now appear to gaze directly at each other, a still center of intimacy amid the joyous celebration.</p>\n",
