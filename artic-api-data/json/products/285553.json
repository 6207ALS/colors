    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>The Keychain Clip is made from industrial grade steel and premium U.S. vegetable tanned leather, handmade in Portland, Oregon. Woolly Made was founded in 2017 by two designers who share high standards for quality and simplicity. Developing a technique of using a laser to pre-cut the stitch holes into every piece, then building a team of independent sewers who do the assembly by hand, the duo ensures that each piece is sewn together perfectly.</span></p><p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Measurements:&nbsp; 1 in.
