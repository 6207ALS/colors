The block is extant and today resides in a private collection in Tahiti (fig. 103.4.1). The most recent printing was carried out in 1995 to commemorate the centenary of Gauguin\u2019s final return to Tahiti in 1885. The edition was limited to 120 copies, twenty of which were hors commerce (\u201cnot for sale\u201d); the Art Institute\u2019s copy is the seventh of twenty. It was published by the Association des Amis du Mus\u00e9e Gauguin (Association of the Friends of the Gauguin Museum) in Tahiti and printed by Luc Gu\u00e9rin at Atelier Lacouri\u00e8re in Montmartre in Paris. Each posthumous impression was presented in a hardbound, cloth-covered portfolio with a Mylar enclosure to protect the print (fig. 103.4.2).\n\nTwo additional posthumous printings of the Te atua wood block were informally carried out earlier in the century, the first between 1920 and 1922 and the second in 1961. Both were modest printings not intended for publication. The former was printed by George Biddle, an American traveling in Tahiti, who was afforded the opportunity \u201cto pull about 20 prints\u201d from the block. The Art Institute does not own a Biddle impression, but those studied outside of the collection are heavily inked in black on white wove paper. The latter printing was carried out by the Swiss artist Otto Tschumi (1904\u20131985), under the auspices of Galerie Kornfeld before the block was sold in the gallery\u2019s June 1961 auction (as lot no. 30). According to the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints, \u201cabout 15 impressions\u201d were pulled \u201con different Japanese papers.\u201d There are two impressions in the Art Institute's collection (fig. 103.4.3 and fig. 103.4.4), which are heavily inked in black.\n\nThe Association\u2019s posthumous impression was richly printed in black over brown ink. The underlying brown ink layer was created using a modern tone block to simulate the appearance of a first-state impression as it was used by Gauguin to fashion multilayered impressions.\n\nA single black inking characterizes the impressions pulled from the block by Tschumi in 1961.\n\nThe Association\u2019s impression is printed on a large, sturdy sheet of cream Japanese paper with pronounced cream fibrous inclusions throughout. The paper is moderately thick, and the long, cream paper fibers add a textural quality to the surface. It is not possible to remove the print from its portfolio without destroying the portfolio. Therefore, examination was limited to what could be seen through the Mylar window. Tschumi printed one of the Art Institute\u2019s impressions on a large, sturdy sheet of cream laid Japanese paper with pronounced cream fibrous inclusions throughout. The paper is moderately thick, and the coarse cream paper fibers add a textured quality to the sheet. The sheet is smooth on the recto. A pattern of brushstrokes from the brush used to smooth the sheet of paper in the drying process during manufacture is visible on the verso. Along the top edge to the right there are several dark fibrous inclusions. The chain lines run vertically, and the width of the chain line intervals varies significantly from 30 mm to 9 mm. The second Tschumi impression was printed on an ivory wove Japanese paper with pronounced white fibrous inclusions throughout. The paper is quite thick, and the white paper fibers add a lustrous quality to the sheet. The recto of the sheet is smooth, and the verso has a textured surface.\n\nIt is possible that the printer of the Association\u2019s 1995 edition was aware of the papers selected by Tschumi, since the paper he chose is remarkably similar in appearance although much larger in size and, judging by its fine quality and deckled edge, was made by hand rather than by machine.\n\n244 \u00d7 227 mm (image); 500 \u00d7 335 mm (sheet, sight)  \nTschumi impression (object no. 137962): 240 \u00d7 226 mm (image); 435 \u00d7 329 mm (sheet)  \nTschumi impression (object no. 152061) : 242 \u00d7 226 mm (image); 387 \u00d7 272 mm (sheet)\n\nThe Association\u2019s impression is in pristine condition. The Tschumi impression (object no. 137962) printed on cream laid Japanese paper is in excellent condition. There is a black ink smudge in the upper left that likely happened when the block was printed. The paper around the printed image is slightly undulated, and there is a pronounced crease along the left edge toward the center. The impression on ivory wove Japanese paper (object no. 152061) is in excellent condition overall.  \nHarriet K.
