R. Way, Memories of James McNeill Whistler (London and New York: John Lane, 1912), opp. p. 104; image size: 154 \u00d7 130 mm; full sheet size: 226 \u00d7 170 mm  \nPosthumous edition: see published edition, above  \nPosthumous watermarks: 326  \nStone: probably erased in 1912  \nSelected Literature: Way (1912), pp. viii, xi, ill. opp. p. 104; Way (1913), pp. 282\u201383\n\nThese two small drawings were not transferred to stone until the year after Whistler\u2019s death. Both their date and place of execution are uncertain. T. R. Way dated the sketches to 1891 in his revised catalogue (1905), but annotated an impression he gave to Frederick Keppel about 1879 / transferred to stone 1904 (now in the New York Public Library). If the street scene was indeed made in Dieppe, as Way\u2019s publications state, then both sketches may have been drawn in the harbor city on one of Whistler\u2019s Channel crossings. The artist made at least two trips to Paris during 1891 (see cat. 41), and this seems the most likely date for these subjects.\n\nThe two sketches were transferred to a single stone in 1904. The printing of the single-image impressions may then have been done by laying smaller sheets of paper over one drawing at a time. T. R. Way thought the vignettes of sufficient interest to include them in his book Memories of James McNeill Whistler (1912), where he made it clear that the images are original lithographs rather than photo-mechanical reproductions.\n\nA: Grand Rue, Dieppe and B: Interior.

For the published edition, the images seem to have been retransferred to another stone, where they were repositioned to appear one above the other. They were printed on cream wove paper, which has often darkened and become brittle with age. The street scene (a) is centered below the small interior (b). Each is printed within its own area of printed tan undertone. Toned areas measure 52 \u00d7 54 mm (b) and 87 \u00d7 130 mm (a).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (226 \u00d7 170 mm), bound.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
