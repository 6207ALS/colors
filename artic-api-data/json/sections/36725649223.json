Ryerson Collection, 1933.1152\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">In late November 1879, young Marthe Hosched\u00e9, the future stepdaughter of Claude Monet, mentioned that the artist was making progress on a \u201cpainting of fruits\u201d and noted that he was \u201cworking hard at his still lifes, which are very pretty.\u201d Monet had several reasons for returning to still-life painting in 1879\u201380. The twenty-nine works he showed at the fourth Impressionist exhibition in 1879, mostly of V\u00e9theuil, a suburb northwest of Paris, had received overall negative reviews, and he may have wanted to engage with a subject that was less fraught, more accessible, and more commercially viable. He was also mourning his wife, Camille, who had died on September 5, 1879, in V\u00e9theuil, where the Monets lived with the family of the artist\u2019s patron, Ernest Hosched\u00e9, who had declared bankruptcy and moved abroad. Monet\u2019s interlude with still-life painting, which occurred in the months following Camille\u2019s death, allowed him to disassociate himself temporarily from working out of doors, which had been an integral part of his life during his years with her. With the added financial responsibilities the artist faced as the breadwinner for his two sons, as well as for the Hosched\u00e9s, painting nature mortes, in which Monet could control the subjects, light, and atmosphere, and which proved surprisingly lucrative, was probably as appealing as it was necessary.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s Apples and Grapes is one of a group of related compositions of comparable scale that Monet produced in 1879\u201380. The Art Institute picture, along with Pears and Grapes (fig. 17.1 [W631]) in the Kunsthalle, Hamburg, and Basket of Apples (fig. 17.2 [W630]), are signed and dated 1880. The date, in addition to the increasingly radical cropping and surface treatment of the works, likely make them the last in the group. Among those thought to be executed earlier, in 1879, are the horizontal Apples and Grapes (fig. 17.3 [W545]), and the vertical Still Life with a Honeydew Melon (fig. 17.4 [W544]), both of which depict a basket overflowing with apples and grapes on a tabletop that is set at an angle and partially covered with a tablecloth. Both these and the Art Institute\u2019s painting bear close similarity to a still life by Monet\u2019s friend the artist Alfred Sisley, Apples and Grapes in a Basket at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute (fig. 17.5). Sisley\u2019s still life is signed but not dated, so it is difficult to know exactly the link between the two artists\u2019 chosen subjects. Indeed, Sisley\u2019s still life, with its exaggeratedly tilted tabletop and patterned cloth, may be a nod to Monet\u2019s treatments of the subject, especially in the case of the Chicago picture. The success Monet had with his still-life compositions of 1879\u201380\u2014which, upon completion, were exhibited and quickly sold\u2014may also have been influential to Sisley.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s still life presents a radical variation on the tabletop still-life theme. The cloth, which covers the entirety of the slanting table, pitched forward, is noticeably similar to that in the Hamburg Pears and Grapes (fig. 17.1); the table in both works fills more than three-fourths of the space, thus eliminating any sense of interior setting or surroundings. In the Hamburg version, Monet omits the basket, resting the fruit instead on a blanket of evergreen branches, which, combined with the addition of walnuts, may refer to the season in which the work was completed. The long, sweeping, blue-and-white brushstrokes used to define the cloth in the Hamburg picture are also seen in the Chicago still life, in which the cloth is in dramatic contrast to the darker background. Moreover, infrared reflectography of the Chicago painting reveals two diagonal lines on the right side of the basket (fig. 17.6), suggesting that at an early state in the composition, Monet may have drawn the table edge closer in so that the basket would be farther back on the table, echoing its placement in the Metropolitan Museum and Hamburger Kunsthalle versions (fig. 17.3 and fig. 17.5).\n\nThe Chicago version displays both bold compositional organization as well as complex painterly technique. The grapes and apples are especially built up, and their varieties are indicated not only by color and shape but also by the way the paint is handled. The larger apples in particular are made up of textural daubs and strokes of low-to-medium impasto; Monet seems to have pushed further the idea of building up their density and separating them out. Not only did he make use of strong outlining strokes\u2014for example, the deep-blue stroke used to indicate the edge of the fruit in shadow (fig. 17.7)\u2014he also incised outlines using a fine-pointed instrument. For the topmost red-and-green apple at right in the basket, Monet scraped into the paint, so that the apple\u2019s contours are defined not only by the circle of pigment but also by the cream-colored ground layer that shows through (fig. 17.8 and fig. 17.9; see Technical Report). A similar technique, whereby heavy outlines of impastoed shapes are carved with a pointed instrument, is seen also in Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s The Plate of Apples (fig. 17.10). Both artists manifested a related approach to their subjects, evident in the tilt of the tabletop; its indeterminate spatial relationship to the wall; the balance between firmly anchored forms (the larger green cooking apples in Monet\u2019s work, for example) and smaller, more randomly placed ones (such as other apples in Monet\u2019s composition that seem ready to roll off the table at lower right); and the emphasis on contour, whether in pigment or in its excision.\n\nAfter the initial wet-on-wet lay-in of compositional elements, such as the tablecloth and fruit, Monet later added wet-on-dry touches. This suggests that he returned to this painting to build up highlights and add the uppermost apple on the right side, which X-ray imaging confirms was painted on top of the tablecloth (fig. 17.11), and the signature. The evidence of paint applied over an already-dry layer may indicate that the work was begun earlier, during the autumn of 1879 when he had supplies on hand. If so, then the canvas may have been picked up again in April 1880 when Monet was preparing for a June one-man exhibition at the offices of La Vie Moderne. For Monet, who was hoping to expand his market after yet another Salon jury rejection, the exhibition was a godsend and, as some scholars have argued, a critical turning point in his career.\n\nThe Art Institute painting is thought to correspond to what the exhibition\u2019s catalogue lists as \u201cCorbeille de fruits,\u201d one of two still lifes (the other listed as \u201cGibier\u201d [possibly W551]), in a well-received exhibition. Several paintings were purchased, including Floating Ice (1880; Shelburne (Vt.) Museum [W568]), which the Salon jury had refused a few months earlier. The owners were not listed in the catalogue, but Apples and Grapes was likely lent by the artist to the show and possibly sold soon after, along with two other works, to a collector known only as Cahuzac.\n\nAlthough the June exhibition took place in an elegant shopping district on the fashionable boulevard des Italiens, with the approval of his patron-friends, Monet took particular care with his self-presentation. The interview he crafted with \u00c9mile Tabareux, as well as the introduction written by Th\u00e9odore Duret for the catalogue, emphasized Monet\u2019s work en plein air and his mission to capture the sensation of nature. As examples of this view of his art, Monet included \u201cCorbeille de fruits,\u201d which has been tentatively identified as the Chicago painting, the most technically and compositionally daring of the 1879\u201380 output.\n\nMonet painted still lifes throughout his life, yet the fruit compositions from 1879\u201380 represent his most concentrated effort in the genre. It was also the last time he would pair apples and grapes, the bounty of the local harvest. Perhaps, as the art historian John House has posited, Monet\u2019s decision to rework and retouch canvases in the studio occupied his indoor activity to the extent that, instead of setting up still lifes to paint when forced indoors, he was using his studio time to advance works already in progress.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Apples and Grapes was painted on a pre-primed, no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. The cream-colored ground consists of two layers. A warp-thread match was determined with Monet\u2019s Cliff Walk at Pourville ( (cat. 19 [W758]), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. Traces of charcoal underdrawing were observed at the edges of the table, the basket, and some of the fruit. In the process of painting, the artist appears to have changed the position of the back right edge of the table. Much of the foreground consists of rich, brush-marked impasto, especially the apples and grapes, which are often composed of a complex buildup of multicolored strokes. In contrast, the background, especially on the right side of the painting, contains washes of thinned reddish-brown paint. One of the apples on the right side was a late addition to the painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 17.12).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1880 (upper left, in reddish-purple paint) (fig. 17.13). The signature and date were applied when the underlying paint layers were already dry (fig. 17.14).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 81 cm. This corresponds to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas, turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 19.3V (0.4) \u00d7 19.9H (0.7) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match with Monet\u2019s Cliff Walk at Pourville (1882; 1933.443 [W758]) (cat. 19) was determined.\n\nThere is mild, relatively even cusping around all four edges.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1973 treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced 5\u201310 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes, spaced approximately 5\u20137 cm apart, correspond to cusping in the canvas (fig. 17.15). Additional holes are probably related to subsequent tacks used to reinforce attachment where the original tacks holes were deteriorated.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher; dates to 1973 lining (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretcher: The pre-1973-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. In an undated report, it is described as five-membered with a vertical crossbar, mitered corners, mortise and tenon joints, ten keys, and beveled front and back. The report gives the following stretcher dimensions: overall, 65 \u00d7 81 cm; outside depth, 0.8 cm; width, 6 cm; inside depth, 0.8 cm; and distance from canvas position, 0.2 cm.\n\nThe pre-1973-treatment stretcher (discarded) had a stamp on the vertical crossbar: 25w [encircled]. (fig. 17.16)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground ranges from approximately 100 to 150 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 17.17). Cross-sectional examination indicates that the ground consists of a double application. The backscattered electron (BSE) image shows the lower region to be slightly more compact and richer in lead white, as evidenced by its brighter white appearance (fig. 17.18). Particles and clusters of lead white and chalk are present in a wide range of sizes.\n\nThe ground is a warm cream tone (fig. 17.19).\n\nAnalysis indicates that both layers contain primarily lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of iron oxide yellow, silicate minerals, alumina, and silica; microscopically, a few black and reddish-brown pigment particles were observed.\n\nInfrared reflectography (IRR) detected two, roughly parallel, drawn lines extending from the upper right grapes in the basket at a slight angle down to the right edge of the painting (fig. 17.20). Microscopic examination further revealed the presence of black particles sparsely dispersed in this area (fig. 17.21) and intermittently around the front and back left table edges (fig. 17.22), the grapes on the table (fig. 17.23), and the basket (fig. 17.24). The underdrawing material is present only as traces where observed.\n\nCharcoal.\n\nThe two parallel lines at the upper right edge do not correlate with forms in the final composition but are likely related to the back edge of the table, which was pushed further back in the painting stage. The other areas of underdrawing seem to correspond closely with the edges of the forms as painted.\n\nThe paint application is mostly wet-on-wet, with only some of the final touches applied over set-up paint. The composition was built up as a whole, with the basket and fruit incorporated into the picture from early on; these elements all appear to be painted directly over the ground with the tablecloth built up around them. The only exception to this is the uppermost apple on the right side. The X-ray shows that this apple was painted on top of the tablecloth and, therefore, was a later addition to the composition (fig. 17.25). Blue paint from the tablecloth is visible in small areas through breaks in the red paint of this apple, which appears to have been applied when the tablecloth was already dry (fig. 17.26).\n\nThe cream-colored ground layer remains exposed at breaks in the brushwork throughout the composition, often at the junctures of forms (fig. 17.27). Around the dark-purple grapes, for example, the ground can be seen in areas where the brush has been dragged lightly across the surface (fig. 17.28). This serves to break up the solidity of the forms, to create space between individual grapes, and to give a sense of their three-dimensionality. The paint application ranges from relatively flat, opaque brushstrokes to textural daubs and strokes of low-to-medium impasto, which occur especially in the lead white\u2013rich passages, such as the light areas of the tablecloth and the highlights of the fruit (fig. 17.29). The background is rather thinly and sketchily painted, particularly the dark reddish-brown area on the right side, which is applied in thin washes of color (fig. 17.30). In general, there is very little blending or mixing of colors on the canvas, only some incidental mixing resulting from the wet-on-wet paint application (fig. 17.31). Rather, the brushwork consists of discrete strokes and touches of color that are juxtaposed and superimposed in rather complex buildups (fig. 17.32). For example, upon closer examination, one can see that the dark, shadowed stem region of one of the apples at lower right actually consists of short, superimposed touches of bright green over deep blue and red (fig. 17.33). The light-colored grapes on the table are constructed from multiple touches using a rather large variety of paint colors (fig. 17.34). The paint application is thicker in the center of each grape, with exposed ground or lightly dragged paint visible around the edges. Many of the apples have a relatively rough surface texture caused by the layering of strokes and especially by the low peaks of paint created when the brush, loaded with relatively stiff paint, was pressed onto and then pulled away from the surface (fig. 17.35). At the upper border of the red and green apple on the right side in the basket, the artist has scraped into the paint with a fine-pointed instrument to expose the cream-colored ground layer (fig. 17.36, fig. 17.37). This appears to have been done before the adjacent blue and yellow paints were applied. The artist often makes use of strong outlining strokes, for example, the deep blue used to suggest the edge of the fruit passing into shadow (fig. 17.38) or, in the case of the dark-purple grapes in the right side of the basket, a contrasting bright orange-red that helps to delineate some of the individual forms.\n\nBased on the presence of two charcoal lines running parallel to the back right edge of the table (as mentioned above; see Underdrawing), it seems that the artist changed his mind about the position of this edge (fig. 17.39). The edge would originally have been closer to the basket, about 6 cm lower than its current position. The change was made early in the painting process, as the brown background is painted only to the current edge of the table and does not continue underneath it. A horizontal impression made in the paint when it was still soft is visible intermittently along the bottom edge, about 1 cm inside of the original foldover. This could be related to a frame rebate or to some type of transport method used before the painting was completely dry (fig. 17.40). There are smears of red paint at the right edge, in the area of the apple that was added later to the composition (fig. 17.41). Again, this may be related to framing or transport when the paint from the apple was still wet. Some traces of anomalous paint are also visible along the left edge.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, emerald green, viridian, vermilion, red lake, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, and bone black. Different UV fluorescence characteristics were observed both macroscopically and microscopically, suggesting that more than one red lake was used. Only one type was analyzed by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and identified as carmine lake. Chalk particles in the form of coccoliths were found associated with the carmine lake particles. Aluminum and phosphorus were detected in association with other red lake particles, thus supporting the hypothesis that two different red lake pigments were used.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished. In 1973, a yellowed varnish was removed and replaced with synthetic varnish. The synthetic varnish was removed in 2011 (see Conservation History). A 1957 examination report indicates that the painting was already varnished by that date.\n\nIn 1973, discolored surface films were removed. The painting was wax-resin lined and re-stretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA. The pretreatment report mentions that, at an earlier date, glue may have been ironed into the back of the canvas due to the presence of slightly crushed impasto.\n\nIn 2011\u201312, the synthetic varnish applied in 1973 was removed, and the painting was left unvarnished. Losses at the edges were filled. Minor retouching was limited to the edges and some of the wider cracks in the compositional area.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. The paint layer is in good condition, with only tiny losses of paint and ground at the original foldovers. Several of these tiny flakes of ground and paint became adhered to the paint surface during lining. There is minor retouching around the edges and in some of the wider-aperture drying cracks within the composition. Remnants of older retouching observed microscopically throughout the paint surface suggest that the work was broadly retouched in a previous treatment. This seems to have included retouching some original areas of exposed ground. There is an overall network of light craquelure, as well as localized drying cracks that occur mainly in the deep reds and in the more translucent, medium-rich areas. There are starch-paste residues from the 1973 facing visible microscopically over the surface. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberely Muir\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), late nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate center and corner cartouches and an independent liner. The frame has both water and oil gilding over bole on cast plaster and gesso. Two different shades of gold were used: one alloy on the outer frame and another on the liner. The bole color is also varied. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the cast foliate on the ogee and sight molding, the scotia sides, and the liner. Red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and bordering fillets. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The liner was burnished; at a later date, the gilding was scraped off the sight edge. The frame has an overall bronze tone, with casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes. The frame has a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back. All back and interior surfaces have been overpainted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with cast, stylized, running undulating bands with rhomboid center punches; scotia side; ogee face with a cast crosshatched bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and an independent fillet liner with a cove sight (fig. 17.42, fig. 17.43).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Cahuzac, Paris, Nov. 1880, in addition to two other paintings (Fleurs, pommes; and Les Saules), for 1,000 francs.\n\nPossibly acquired by Durand-Ruel, Paris, c. 1883.\n\nAcquired by Catholina Lambert, Paterson, N.J., by May 16, 1895.\n\nSold by Catholina Lambert, Paterson, New Jersey, to Durand-Ruel, New York, May 16, 1895.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

For Gedo, the \u201cdeliberateness [of the still lifes], their heavily coated surfaces, also reflect the artist\u2019s meditations about Camille.\u201d The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein,Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nBasket of Apples was bought from Monet by Th. Delius in October 1880. See Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 2, Nos. 1\u2013968 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 240, cat. 630 (ill.). Christie\u2019s, New York, Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale, sale cat. (Nov. 1, 2005), lot 1, states that Frederic Delius acquired the painting from Monet in 1883.

It may be that Petit\u2019s interest in the still life motivated Monet to make multiples in this genre, including the slightly later Chicago painting. For more on Petit\u2019s December 1879 purchase, see Annette Dixon, \u201cThe Marketing of Monet: The Exhibition at La Vie Moderne,\u201d in Annette Dixon, Carole McNamara, and Charles Stuckey, Monet at V\u00e9theuil: The Turning Point, exh. cat.

Sisley sat for the portrait Pierre-Auguste Renoir made of him (1876; Art Institute of Chicago) while at Monet\u2019s house in Argenteuil. See Colin B. Bailey, with the assistance of John B. Collins, Renoir\u2019s Portraits: Impressions of an Age, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Canada/Yale University Press, 1997), p. 149, citing a 1926 letter from Monet to Durand-Ruel; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 4, Peintures, 1899\u20131926 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1985), p. 421, letter 2623. Sylvie Patin discusses Monet and Sisley generally, mentioning Fran\u00e7ois Depeaux and Count Isaac de Camondo, collectors whom the artists had in common; see Patin, \u201cVeneux-Nadon and Moret-sur-Loing: 1880\u20131899,\u201d in Alfred Sisley, ed. Mary Anne Stevens, exh. cat. (Royal Academy of Arts, London/Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay/Walters Art Gallery/Yale University Press, 1992), pp. 184\u201385.

Godfroy discusses in detail the purchases made by Durand-Ruel and the dealer\u2019s involvement in Sisley\u2019s career through the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nPreviously dated 1876, Sisley\u2019s Apples and Grapes in a Basket has recently been redated to c. 1880\u201381. See Richard Kendall, \u201cApples and Grapes in a Basket,\u201d 19th-Century European Paintings at the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, ed. Sarah Lees (Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute/Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 736\u2013738, cat. 305. Kendall suggests that, given Monet\u2019s recent success with his still lifes of 1879\u201380, it seems likely that Sisley painted Apples and Grapes in a Basket in response to Monet\u2019s compositions, possibly soon after Monet\u2019s 1880 exhibition at La vie moderne. Kendall also points to the still lifes included by C\u00e9zanne in the 1877 Impressionist exhibition as possibly an inspiration for Sisley.\n\nMicroscopic examination further revealed the presence of sparsely dispersed charcoal particles in this area, see Technical Report.\n\nSee Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 210.\n\nSee Technical Report, in particular, the description of the signature and date, which were applied when the underlying paint layers were already dry.\n\nA trendy magazine chronicling cultural happenings about town, La vie moderne was founded in 1879 by Monet\u2019s collector-friends Georges Charpentier and Ernest Hosched\u00e9, and it may have been Hosched\u00e9 who arranged for Monet\u2019s first solo exhibition. It may also have been Renoir, \u00c9douard Manet, or Th\u00e9odore Duret; on this, and for more on Monet\u2019s 1880 exhibition the offices of La Vie Moderne, see Annette Dixon, \u201cThe Marketing of Monet: The Exhibition at La Vie Moderne,\u201d in Annette Dixon, Carole McNamara, and Charles Stuckey, Monet at V\u00e9theuil: The Turning Point, exh. cat.

Only one of the two paintings Monet submitted was accepted to the Salon of 1880, Lavacourt (1880; Dallas Museum of Arts [W578]); the other, Floating Ice (1880; Shelburne [Vt.] Museum, [W568]), was rejected.

Charles Ephrussi and another collector, known only as Ratisbonne, had also expressed interest while it was on exhibition.

Other candidates for no. 2 \u201cCorbeille de fruits\u201d at the exhibition at Le Vie Moderne are Still Life with a Honeydew Melon, possibly purchased by Theulier from Monet in December 1879; and the Metropolitan Museum still life, possibly bought by Georges Petit from Monet, also in 1879. Le panier de pommes, signed and dated 1880, although compositionally quite different, is also a candidate, because it was purchased from Monet by Theodore Delius in October 1880.\n\n\u201cA work listed as no. 2 in the exhibition, Corbeille de fruits, may have been one of the three that Cahuzac bought for 1000 francs from the artist in November; possibly this was Nature morte: pommes et raisin (Still Life: Apples and Grapes), now at the Art Institute of Chicago.\u201d Annette Dixon, \u201cThe Marketing of Monet: The Exhibition at La Vie Moderne,\u201d in Annette Dixon, Carole McNamara, and Charles Stuckey, Monet at V\u00e9theuil: The Turning Point, exh. cat.

Several scholars have likened Monet\u2019s radical viewpoint, looking down at the tabletop from a high, steep angle, to the high vantage point and radical cropping he would use for his later views of the cliffs of Normandy (see, e.g., Cliff Walk at Pourville[cat. 19]). Interestingly, the warp-weave of Cliff Walk at Pourville has been found to match that of Apples and Grapes, suggesting that the canvases (both of which were commercially prepared) came from the same bolt of canvas. See Technical Report\n\nLater fruit still lifes include Paul Durand-Ruel\u2019s 1882\u201385 commission to have Monet decorate six doors of his Paris apartment\u2019s drawing room, incorporating thirty-six paintings of fruits and flowers that included Panier de pommes (1885; private collection [W936]); Panier de raisins, coings et poires (1883; Columbus Museum of Art [W954]), and Prunes et abricots (1882/85; private collection [W955]), among many others. Monet also produced a pair of still lifes during a spell of bad weather in Bordighera in 1884: Oranges sur une branche (1884; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston [W887]), and Citrons sur une branche (1884; private collection [W888]).

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture for the signature contains lead white, vermilion, cobalt blue, and red lake. Other pigments may also be present.

The number is probably a reference to the stretcher format, indicating that it was a no. 25 standard size.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatment, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThis is very similar to what was observed in the ground layer of Cliff Walk at Pourville (cat. 19), which was found to have a weave match with this painting. It should be noted, however, that the identification of single versus multiple layers of a single ground formulation from cross-sectional analysis can be difficult due to changes that occur in the materials with drying and aging. For a discussion of the challenges and caveats of interpreting ground layers in cross sections, see Leslie Carlyle, Jaap J. Boon, Ralph Haswell, and Martje Stols-Witlox, \u201cHistorically Accurate Ground Reconstructions for Oil Paintings,\u201d in Preparation for Painting: The Artist\u2019s Choice and Its Consequences, ed.

One large, isolated, black particle was identified as carbon black (SEM/EDX). Traces of sodium, magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground scraping taken in 1974/75 was reexamined by PLM in 2013. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 22, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 16, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Apples\\_33\\_1152\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 2, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nResearch on the collection of Impressionist paintings at the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum and associated Fondation Corboud in Cologne has detected similar traces of charcoal underdrawing in works by Monet and some of his contemporaries. It is noted that the \u201clines were easy to blow or brush away during the painting process. For this reason, the extent of the sketch (which can often only be demonstrated under a microscope) is in many cases practically imperceptible.\u201d Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), p. 102.\n\nThe material was analyzed using PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 22, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Traces of charcoal were also observed in several of the paint scraping samples, suggesting that the charcoal was sometimes incorporated into the paint when it was painted over; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 16, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAnother possible explanation comes from Anthea Callen,The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 201, where she suggests that artists may have used \u201cpainting frames\u201d in the studio for reworking and finishing a painting: \u201cDuring the last stages of studio re-touching, adjustments were made while the picture was isolated by its painting frame; thus the picture could be finally resolved, made to work within the confines of the frame as it would be seen when exhibited. . . . Some painters kept plain painting frames, in a number of standard sizes on which they commonly worked, specifically for the final touches to a painting; others simply made their retouches when the work was in its definitive frame and ready for exhibition.\u201d\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: cobalt blue (PLM, SEM/EDX, XRF, electron microprobe); lead white, emerald green, vermilion, and cadmium yellow (PLM, SEM/EDX, XRF); viridian, ultramarine blue, chrome yellow (PLM, SEM/EDX); red lake, bone black (PLM); carmine lake (SERS). XRF detected traces of iron throughout the painting; however, further analysis would be required to determine the source. Paint scrapings taken in 1974/75 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Some of the samples taken in 1974/75 were analyzed by electron microprobe in 1978. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 22, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1152\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 16, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Apples\\_33\\_1152\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 2, 2011; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cMon\\_Apples&amp;Grapes\\_1933\\_1152\\_SERS\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.
