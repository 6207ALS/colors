    "description": "<p>This man\u2019s garment was woven like a Chim\u00fa textile made on the north coast of Peru, but its feline motifs are similar to those created by Ica or Chincha artists of the south coast. It may have been produced when these cultures were subjugated by the Inca Empire. Unfortunately, few similar brown-and-white feathered tunics are currently known, making comparative studies difficult. The Art Institute of Chicago stewards this one as well as a second example, and the Linden Museum in Stuttgart preserves a third. All three were collected around 1900 by a German doctor living in Lima named Eduard Gaffron.</p>\n",
