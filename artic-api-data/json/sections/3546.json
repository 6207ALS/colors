Indeed, his very first pictures were two related still-life paintings made while convalescing from an illness at his parents\u2019 home in Bohain-en-Vermandois. Later, as a student in the atelier of Gustave Moreau, the artist built on this experience, making copies of Old Master paintings in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre as part of his artistic instruction. Over a ten-year period, he produced works after many artists, among them La desserte (after Jan Davidsz. de Heem) (1893; fig. 24.1), Copy of Chardin\u2019s \u201cThe Ray\u201d (1897\u20131903; Mus\u00e9e Matisse, Le Cateau Cambr\u00e9sis), and Copy of Fragonard\u2019s \u201cThe Music Lesson\u201d (date and location unknown). The practice encouraged students to avoid direct invention and to follow instead the elements of composing and painting a picture devised by older masters. As Matisse recalled to art historian Pierre Courthion in 1941, \u201cWe looked to see how it was painted: the objects, the glazing, the passages from light to shadow. We studied it with a magnifying glass.\u201d Such exactitude prevented personal interpretation; Matisse and his friends worked \u201caccording to the letter and not the spirit.\u201d The approach was required, especially if they hoped that the French government would acquire their copies.\n\nWhen it came to his own works, Matisse continued to find artistic inspiration in repeated motifs, whether remaking a figure from one medium in another (see cat. 36 and cat. 37) or returning to a particular subject, such as a studio still life, in the same one (see cat. 21 and cat. 22). Reworking an already familiar subject\u2014like the scene in Bathers by a River (1909/10, May\u2013Nov. 1913, and early spring 1916\u2013c. Oct. 1917; cat. 25)\u2014in which the initial invention of the figures and their poses was already complete could free him to focus on other issues: to continue to pursue the essence of a form, to search for still simpler means of making, or to move the piece as a whole in a new direction. The challenge in revisiting a motif was the preservation of the original feeling or \u201cexpression,\u201d as Matisse termed it.\n\nThe Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s canvas, known today as Apples, is an example of a particular kind of reworking that became increasingly important to the artist during the period of 1913 to 1917: the practice of producing two versions of the very same subject with the same dimensions and format. Apples and its counterpart, Bowl of Apples on a Table (1916; fig. 24.2), were purchased together by Matisse\u2019s dealer, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, on November 13, 1916, and photographed that same month. Considered one of Matisse\u2019s \u201cpainted pairs,\u201d they were once even more closely titled: the dealer\u2019s stock book records them as \u201cNature morte aux pommes sur fond vert\u201d (no. 20775) and \u201cNature morte aux pommes sur fond noir et jaune\u201d (no. 20776). Over the years and in translation, however, the titles have changed, perhaps reflecting the impression of their production as the artist progressively engaged in a process of greater simplification and radical abstraction.\n\nIndeed, the dramatic shift represented by these works parallels some of Matisse\u2019s other, earlier painted pairs, such as the two 1914 views of Notre Dame (fig. 24.3 and fig. 24.4), one of which is more detailed and naturalistically rendered, the other is more summary and abstract. In this instance, the related paintings recall the nineteenth-century academic tradition of the esquisse (a freely painted, preparatory sketch) and tableau (a more finished painting) of the same subject. Although Matisse would challenge this approach in his early career, devising various additional relationships between pairs of painted pictures, he would also return to the esquisse-tableau concept; it is likely that he did so in the case of Apples and Bowl of Apples on a Table since the stock book numbers, while not exact confirmation of production order, may reflect the sequence in which the artist presented the works to his dealer. However, without further historical documentation to confirm the precise chronology and relationship of the works, we must look to the context of the studio to better understand Matisse\u2019s process in producing this particular painted pair. The two canvases reveal significant technical differences that underscore the artist\u2019s continued struggle to find painted equivalents for the effects of light on atmosphere, mass, and matter in these years and perhaps even challenge our assumptions about their order of production.\n\nThough often seen as a pair, Bowl of Apples on a Table and Apples are also part of a group of still lifes and interior scenes that Matisse took up in the late spring and summer 1916. In April or May of that year, the Danish painter and critic Axel Salto visited the artist\u2019s studio and witnessed not only The Moroccans (1915/16; Museum of Modern Art, New York) underway but also \u201csome supernatural interiors. Stronger, more pure in style and in touch with Cubist theories . . . larger and larger \u2018displays of force.\u2019\u201d We can identify three of these from Matisse\u2019s June 1 letter to the dealer L\u00e9once Rosenberg in which he announced the completion of The Window (late Apr.\u2013May 1916; fig. 24.5), Bowl of Oranges (May 1916; fig. 24.6), and The Ivy Branch (May 1916; Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich), a composition he planned \u201cto work again on another canvas.\u201d In late July, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune confirmed the purchase of another 1916 interior that Salto likely saw in process, Still Life with Plaster Bust (July 1916; Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia). Bowl of Apples on a Table and Apples were surely part of this group, for in late July, the painter Albert Huyot visited Matisse\u2019s studio and later asked about the progress of one of them, writing, \u201cthe still life of apples impressed me with its beauty.\u201d\n\nIn each of these works Matisse explored the material effects of light and space, translating optical depth into built-up layers of paint on canvas. Such effects were markedly different from the monotypes he made in those same years, images in which the artist suggested illumination by removing black ink from the plate and leaving lines of unprinted white paper in the final print. Between 1914 and 1916, Matisse made several sets of still-life compositions that relate to his pair of apple paintings, some of closely studied apples (see fig. 24.7) or the fruit with other still-life elements (see fig. 24.8 and fig. 24.9) and some of apples as part of a larger scene. Two monotypes made in 1914/15 (fig. 24.10 and fig. 24.11) most closely resemble the apple paintings, with their numerous, simplified pieces of fruit resting upon a decorative Moroccan plate. For these works, Matisse varied his removal of ink in the contour lines of the apples, which especially contrast to the thinner lines used to describe the dish, and produced a sense of depth and brilliance in his dark, shallow vessel.\n\nInversely, in such paintings as The Window (fig. 24.5), Matisse rendered the areas of the most brilliant light, translucency, and atmosphere in a material way\u2014with a thick band of white. Similarly, in Bowl of Oranges (fig. 24.6), he investigated the dematerializing nature of light, describing the space around the fruit bowl and glass itself, and areas between each orange, with white paint that was applied heavily with a palette knife. These canvases demonstrate a change in Matisse\u2019s approach and his interest in bringing an almost sculptural quality to paint application, one that is inherently reversed. In Bowl of Oranges the areas of illumination\u2014those that embody the greatest physical immateriality\u2014are the thickest passages on the canvas; in contrast, the shady depths of the composition are described in the thinnest layers of dark-black paint.\n\nSimilar differences can also be seen in the two apple compositions: Bowl of Apples on a Table is thickly painted, with broad passages covering earlier colors, the materiality of which stands in for the atmosphere of the room. But it is at the left edge of the canvas that we see Matisse\u2019s greatest invention: here, he described the source of illumination by building up the surface with a thick impasto of white paint over which he added green and black. Using a heavily bristled brush, he then scraped at the green surface, revealing some of the white below. The effect is one of dematerialized, intense light made through the matter of paint itself.\n\nIn contrast, Apples is a thinly and quickly painted work with freely moving short brushstrokes and long, smooth arcs. While it has a similar arrangement to Bowl of Apples, the viewpoint is a step closer into the composition and slightly higher. The painting\u2019s warm palette contrasts with the overwhelming black on the top and left side, to which Matisse added a natural varnish; this serves to intensify the compression and elision of space in the canvas. Like its companion, Apples too is about light and reminds us of the artist\u2019s comments on the far smaller Gourds (1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York), a painting in which he used \u201cpure black as a color of light and not as a color of darkness.\u201d But while Apples describes the effect of light, its shallow surface recalls the many monotypes of related images, and it seems a surprising return at a moment when Matisse was exploring the connections between optical and constructed depth in both his small-scale interiors and his monumental works, such as Bathers by a River and The Piano Lesson (1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York). In this regard, it is worth considering the possibility that Apples preceded Bowl of Apples on a Table; this might better reflect the artist\u2019s move toward greater explorations of constructed depth, his transformation of shallow black surfaces into ones of more nuance, and his increasing experimentation with the left edge of a number of canvases (Bathers by a River, the most extreme example) in which he incised into the paint and layered or banded colors to suggest not only a potential source of light but also a transition from the viewer\u2019s space into that of the composition.\n\nWhile this idea may be tempting, it is without historical documentation. Perhaps far more important is to recall Matisse\u2019s stated interest in what he would term \u201chygiene,\u201d a desire after having explored possible variations of a theme to go on to \u201csomething new.\u201d With this in mind, we might consider his adoption of the more traditional esquisse-tableau model for Bowl of Apples on a Table and Apples as perhaps less a compositional device than a vehicle for a different approach, construction, and sensory effect. In returning to an earlier mode of painting, he might explore something he had previously overlooked. And as exemplified in all of his painted pairs, there was the promise for Matisse to refresh and revive his work.\n\nApples was previously owned by the great New York collector John Quinn, who by the time of his death had amassed a collection of over 2,500 works of modern (mostly European) and African art. In 1919 Quinn formulated the unprecedented goal of acquiring only modern \u201cworks of museum rank\u201d by a small number of artists, including Matisse, Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i, and Pablo Picasso, and focused his activities there. As he explained later to his friend Marcel Duchamp: \u201cI have come to the time in my modest career of collector when I desire to add works of first-rate importance and not more sketches or tentative work. This is a point that every collector, I imagine, arrives at sooner or later.\u201d In May 1919 Quinn purchased Apples and another canvas by Matisse from the New York modern art dealer Marius de Zayas, who featured the work in a group exhibition. Soon after his acquisition, Quinn enthusiastically reported to the Irish artist John Butler Yeats, \u201cI have just got two wonderful paintings by Matisse, one the painting of a woman [The Italian Woman, 1916; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York], and the other a large still life, a great bowl of apples. They fairly flash and sing and are wonderful things.\u201d Apples would be one of at least seventeen works by Matisse in Quinn\u2019s impressive collection.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse painted Apple on a no. 50 portrait (figure) standard-size pre-primed linen canvas. He applied the paint layers thinly and directly, following a simple painted sketch of various shades of dilute brown that partially outlined the round table, the bowl, and most of the fruit. However, it is possible that Matisse began even more directly, laying in the first three apples in red paint before sketching the other apples behind them, since no preliminary sketch lines for three of the apples are apparent. The picture appears to have been painted quickly, with assurance and ease, and Matisse made no changes.\n\nA warm golden glow is conveyed by the predominantly warm palette (even the black hue is warm) and by the bright yellow at the right side that shifts down into pale, luminous brown toward the center, as if emanating from a strong light source beyond the right edge. The artist loosely applied a very thin surface coating, which maintains the dark saturation of the blacks. The picture has remained unlined, still on its original stretcher, and retains the artist\u2019s original coating.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images, (fig. 24.12).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in reddish brown paint) (fig. 24.13 and fig. 24.14).The signature is underneath the varnish.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nMatisse painted Apples on a no. 50 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. The present size is 0.5 cm larger in both length and width (approximately 0.25 cm on all sides) than the dimensions after the original stretching. The canvas has not been restretched, and the increase in size is the result of keying out to address slack.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 20.4V (0.4) \u00d715.3H (0.5) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. Apples has the same thread count as Matisse\u2019s Bowl of Apples on a Table (1916; fig. 24.15) and The Rose Marble Table (spring\u2013summer 1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York). No weave matches were found among the paintings, although they still may have been cut from the same larger piece of canvas.\n\nThe canvas is finely woven for a picture this size, but Matisse often used still finer canvases for even larger pictures. The selvage edge is extant on the left side of the painting (fig. 24.16). This side shows strong regular cusping every 10 cm, which corresponds to stretching the canvas for priming (fig. 24.17). The other three sides were cut through the priming. The slight cusping on these sides occurred when the primed canvas was mounted on the current stretcher (see Stretching).\n\nCurrent stretching: This appears to be the original stretching, though extra tacks were added at some point to reduce slack and some old tacks were rehammered. The original tacks were placed irregularly from 5 to 12 cm apart, suggesting it was stretched in the studio.\n\nThe left tacking margin is 5.5\u20136.5 cm in width, of which 1.2 cm is raw canvas, including the selvage. The width of the other tacking margins is 3\u20135.5 cm; these sides show only slight cusping, from stretching the primed canvas onto the present stretcher. This cusping corresponds to the placement of the original tacks.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The present stretcher is original, since the canvas has not been restretched. It is six-membered, including a vertical and a horizontal crossbar, with half-lap corner construction. Stretcher-bar dimensions: width, 5.5 cm; depth, 2.0 cm (fig. 24.18).\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nCross-sectional analysis reveals the presence of a fairly thick, brownish organic layer between the ground and the canvas that is probably a glue layer. The layer has a blue fluorescence under ultraviolet light (fig. 24.19).\n\nPre-primed. Diagonal marks from a knife used to spread out the ground are visible in the X-ray, particularly on the left side (fig. 24.20). Brush marks that created an even edge, 1.2 cm short of the selvage, are also evident. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of a single layer ranging in thickness from 26 to 71 \u03bcm.\n\nWhite (fig. 24.21). There are trace amounts of pigment particles in the ground (fig. 24.22).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white (basic lead carbonate) and calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of various silicates and silica, and possibly with trace amounts of iron oxide\u2013containing pigments, in an oil binder (fig. 24.23).\n\nMatisse drew simple outlines in brown shades to place the table, bowl, and most of the apples. The sketch does not stand out when examined under infrared light because it is not black; parts are visible with the naked eye and under stereomicroscopic examination in places where the sketch is not heavily covered by paint. Only the lower three quarters of the tabletop were indicated in the sketch. No sketch lines are apparent for the two red apples at the very front and a centered scarlet apple in the row behind, and it is possible that Matisse laid these three in directly with red paint and only then sketched the other apples behind them (fig. 24.24).\n\nMatisse painted the preliminary sketch of basic contour lines in dilute shades of brown: purple-brown for the apples and their navels and also for the concentric arcs under the green center of the bowl (fig. 24.25 and fig. 24.26); a more yellow-brown for the outer edge of the bowl that then spirals inward around the apples (fig. 24.27), and a darker brown for the table edge. Red lake and bone black in a purple-brown sketch line were identified by PLM.\n\nNone apparent.\n\nApples was painted thinly and directly and was apparently completed quickly without changes. The paint is often very dilute, and in many areas extra medium was added, which allowed for quick, fluid strokes that were also more transparent, pooling in the interstices of the canvas weave (fig. 24.28 and fig. 24.29). Most apples were first blocked in thinly with a single color, often a subtly mixed shade like dark red rather than a color straight from the tube. Matisse shaded most of the apples, sometimes using a more opaque layer of the same color used for the translucent lay-in and sometimes a contrasting hue (fig. 24.30). Some pieces of fruit were highlighted with a second color, such as a pink blush over yellow body color, or more subtly, a slight greenish tinge over yellow (fig. 24.31). On another apple, the local red blush was painted before the overall yellow, the two mixing wet-in-wet (fig. 24.32). These examples illustrate the artist\u2019s free, unmethodical approach.\n\nFor the bowl, Matisse filled in the spaces between the concentric yellow-brown spiraling line of the preliminary sketch with a pink tone, applying long, sweeping strokes near the outside and shorter ones farther in (fig. 24.33). He painted the center of the bowl green with short, concentric, arced strokes that follow the preliminary sketch. The brushwork for the bowl, with the exception of the green at center, was applied in a circular direction that give the sense that the bowl is spinning. The diagonal, dark green sets of lines indicating the bowl\u2019s rim contribute to the sense of spin.\n\nA golden light enfolds the table from the lower right. The black background also appears illuminated from the right, where the paint is first diluted to form a transparent black, and then applied in separated strokes, as if double-clutching from black to yellow (fig. 24.34). After shifting to yellow on the right, the background paint was brushed out vigorously in transparent strokes, creating bands of color that blend from intense yellow through several shades of golden brown, into the darker brown of the table\u2019s central post (fig. 24.35). The post, without a base, functions as much as a color band as it does a structural element, and the tabletop is supported visually as much by the cupped shapes of the background spaces below it as by this thin post.\n\nMatisse added final black contour lines to the apples, bowl, and table, and then a stronger black shadow under the front edge of the bowl and around the apples at front. The black lines reinforce the individual shapes but also string the apples together (fig. 24.36).\n\nBrushes (various sizes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white; zinc white; iron oxide\u2013containing pigments including red-brown, yellow, and burnt sienna, strontium/chrome\u2013containing pigments such as strontium yellow, chrome yellow, and/or viridian; vermilion, bone black and red lake.\n\nMatisse used a limited palette of primarily warm colors: dark red, red, orange-red, reddish brown, light brown, warm ocher, and the pink tint of reddish brown. These colors are set off by the black surround and by the green tint, red\u2019s complement, in the center of the bowl. The black was also made warmer with small additions of iron oxide pigments. The outside edge of the bowl was decorated with several groups of parallel strokes in gray-green. Matisse created an optical green with parallel strokes of black over yellow on the right side and also mixed a little black into his yellow at the lower right, bringing it toward olive green and keeping it within the tonal range of the other colors. The bright scarlet apple in front is primarily colored by vermilion. However, many of the red apples, such as the three at left in the front row, do not contain vermilion and are colored instead by pigments such as iron oxides and/or red lake.\n\nOil (estimated). Extra medium was added to the paint to increase fluidity, suggested by the drips of pink near the right edge (fig. 24.37) that probably occurred when the bowl was painted. Paint diluted with extra medium becomes smoother and more fluid, facilitating quicker and longer unbroken brushstrokes. This paint can be used more transparently for greater luminosity without sacrificing its cohesive body and insolublity. The effect created by paint that is primarily diluted with turpentine, rather than medium, is illustrated by the more diffuse black drips next to the pink ones.\n\nA final thin transparent coating was applied to the paint surface. The entire surface, including exposed ground, has a soft sheen from this coating. He likely also applied extra layers of the coating over the blacks. When the paining is examined under ultraviolet light, the brushstrokes from the coating application are most easily discerned over the blacks, where their fluorescence contrasts strongly with the dark color, while in other areas the fluorescence is less easily distinguished (fig. 24.38). The coating is thickest at upper right, where the unevenly applied strokes have left islands of gloss and impart a slight texture. In the large expanse of black below the bowl of apples, the application appears more dilute. The artist pulled long strokes down from the top of this area, which resulted in less gloss toward the bottom.\n\nSince the painting was pristine and untreated when acquired in 1948, this coating was likely applied by Matisse. The thin application, soft sheen, and relative insolubility of the coating are similar to coatings on other Matisse paintings.\n\nWhen the painting was acquired in 1948, there was no additional varnish, and the stretching may have been original. At some point, paper tape had been added around the edges, but it was later removed. A few tacks were added, and some old tacks were rehammered.\n\nIn 1957 a synthetic varnish was applied to the surface.\n\nIn 2008 the synthetic varnish was removed from the surface of the painting, but the original varnish was left in place (see Varnish layer/media). After cleaning, inconsistencies in saturation in the black in the lower left lent a patchy appearance to some passages. A dilute solution of Acryloid B-72 was rubbed into these areas of black paint to achieve a more consistent saturation. This was also rubbed into the dark-brown table post below the bowl of apples. Every attempt was made to retain the variability of the original surface gloss. Areas of cracking and a few very small areas of loss were consolidated, and the losses and cracks inpainted.\n\nIn 2011 the worn canvas at the bottom corners was reinforced.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition, particularly since it is unlined and remains on its original stretcher with only the original layer of varnish. The glossy synthetic varnish was recently removed, though a slight amount of varnish was rubbed into some black and dark-brown areas of patchy saturation. There are areas of thin cracks, and some cracks in the ground have raised the canvas in slight distortions. There is a water stain on the reverse, but no ill consequences from it are found on the front.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, twenty-first-century, L-shaped, molding frame. The frame has a dark-red-brown-stained and varnished finish over a mahogany molding. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight outer side and fillet face (fig. 24.39).\n\nPrevious frame (removed 2009): The painting was previously housed in a mid-twentieth-century, American, gilded, torus-profile molding frame. The frame had water gilding on a yellow-ocher bole over gesso. The gilding was highly burnished and toned with a light coat of varnish. The basswood moldings were mitered and nailed with a lapped back frame applied at a later date. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was straight side and torus face (fig. 24.40).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1922; removed mid-twentieth century): While in the collection of John Quinn and the Quinn estate, who owned the painting from December 26, 1919, until 1924, the painting was exhibited in a different frame at the Exhibition: Contemporary French Art, March\u2013April 1922, at the Sculptors\u2019 Gallery, New York (fig. 24.41). The frame appears to be a gilded molding frame with a steep bolection profile with a gilded fillet at the sight edge (for a similar outer frame molding of the same time period minus the liner element see fig. 24.42).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Nov. 13, 1916\u2013Jan. 15, 1917.\n\nSold to Henry Bernstein, Jan. 15, 1917\u2013Dec. 13, 1917.\n\nSold to Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, from Dec. 13, 1917.\n\nMarius de Zayas, New York, by May 1919\u2013after Dec. 26, 1919.\n\nSold to John Quinn (Apr. 24, 1870\u2013July 28, 1924), New York, after Dec. 26, 1919\u2013July 28, 1924.\n\nBy descent to John Quinn Estate, New York, July 28, 1924\u2013Feb. 9, 1927.\n\nSold to F.

T\u00e9riade, \u201cMatisse Speaks,\u201d Art News Annual 21 (1951), pp. 41\u201342. For its lack of originality, Matisse ranked this kind of copying as a low form of artistic achievement: \u201cThe works most successful with the purchasing commission were those done by the mothers, wives, and daughters of museum guards. Our copies were only accepted out of charity, or sometimes when [art critic] Roger-Marx pleaded our case. I would have liked to be literal, like the mothers, wives and daughters of the guards, but couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAmong the notable examples of earlier artists Matisse possibly looked to for working in series or variations (Gustave Caillebotte, Edgar Degas, Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, Georges Seurat), he was surely influenced in this regard by C\u00e9zanne, and his own small Three Bathers (summer 1907) was inspired by the artist. For more on C\u00e9zanne\u2019s exploration of this theme, see Mary Louise Krumrine, Paul C\u00e9zanne: The Bathers (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston/Eidolon/Abrams, 1990).\n\nIn a 1907 interview with Guillaume Apollinaire, Matisse described his process of finding a voice, looking first to ancient and then modern masters and then back to his own works. He commented that while this at first seemed \u201cto be monotonous repetition,\u201d it was instead the manifestation of his intent, his \u201cpersonality, that appeared the same no matter what different states of mind I passed through.\u201d He discussed this desire to \u201cexpress\u201d himself through his artistic materials \u201cwith purity,\u201d developing this idea of expression the following year in his seminal \u201cNotes of a Painter.\u201d See Apollinaire, \u201cHenri Matisse.\u201d La phalange 11, no. 18 (Dec. 1907), p. 482.\n\nFor images of these photographs, see Dauberville and Dauberville, Henri Matisse, vol. 1, pp. 557\u201359, figs. 159, 160.\n\nBernheim-Jeune\u2019s photographs also follow this order: \u201cNature morte aux pomme sur fond vert\u201d was assigned no. 1531 and \u201cNature morte aux pommes sur fond noir et jaune,\u201d no. 1532.\n\nBy 1919 \u201cNature morte aux pommes sur fond noir et jaune\u201d had already changed to \u201cApples\u201d for its New York debut. For more on the 1913\u201317 period, see D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse.\n\nThere are, for example, no references to the paintings in Alfred C. Barr\u2019s questionnaires to the artist or in Pierre Courthion\u2019s interviews with him. While Matisse occasionally used numbers to record the order of his experimentation with a theme, the way we know many numbered pairs today originated with Barr; see Barr, Matisse: His Art and His Public (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1951). In the case of the present paintings, Barr did not number them but wrote that Bowl of Apples on a Table was the second of the pair.\n\nAxel Salto, \"Henri Matisse,\" Klingen 1, no. 7 (Apr. 1918), n.pag.\n\nHenri Matisse to L\u00e9once Rosenberg, June 1, 1916, manuscript department, Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Paris.\n\nF\u00e9lix F\u00e9n\u00e9on to Henri Matisse, July 26, 1916; and Albert Huyot to Matisse, undated [probably late July], Archives Henri Matisse, Paris.

It is possible that his work on Gourds (1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York) and its relationship to these later monotypes may have spurred him to revive a related composition on canvas.\n\nMatisse used this dark enveloping shadow for a related composition in the fall of 1916 with a different resulting effect; see his Fruit Dish with Nutcracker in the collection of the Statens Museum for Kunst, Collection J.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image.

Apples has the same dimensions as the related Chrysler Bowl of Apples on a Table and was painted at more or less the same time. Rose Marble Table was painted on a larger size canvas.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and C.

Rose Marble Table is slightly larger and was begun slightly later.\n\nMatisse\u2019s Woman on a Highstool (1914; Museum of Modern Art, New York), Yvonne Landsberg (1914; Philadelphia Museum of Art), Goldfish and Palette (1914\u201315; Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Studio, Quai Saint-Michel (1916; Phillips Collection, Washington, DC) are all larger paintings and all were painted on finer-woven canvas. The Moroccans (late 1915 and fall 1916; Museum of Modern Art, New York), though much larger, is also on a finer canvas.

This is corroborated by the fact that the edge of the ground is straight despite the cusping of the canvas at that edge.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1948\\_563\\_Matisse\\_Apples\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 22, 2017, on file in the Conservation and Science Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1948\\_563\\_Matisse\\_Apples\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 22, 2017, on file in the Conservation and Science Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed by FTIR, PLM), XRF, and SEM/EDX. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1948\\_563\\_Matisse\\_Apples\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 22, 2017; Gw\u00e9na\u00eblle Gautier, \u201c Matisse\\_FTIR results summary\\_2011,\u201d June 13, 2011; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cMatisse\\_Apples\\_1948.563\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 11, 2013, all on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe three-quarters contour in the sketch is the same portion depicted in Bowl of Apples on a Table. Although the apples cover the same area in both paintings, the size of the bowl in Apples is larger than the one in Bowl of Apples on a Table; in fact, it is the same size as the table in the latter picture. In Apples, the larger area of the bowl around the apples was filled in with the long line, spiraling inward from the outside of the bowl.\n\nThese three apples cannot be a later addition after the sketch, since the sketch lines for the apples behind take account of the front apples.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1948\\_563\\_Matisse\\_Apples\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 22, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pink is most likely a tint of the same iron oxide pigment used for the table, made by simply adding white.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMatisse\\_Apples\\_1948\\_563\\_XRF\\_Results\u201d Apr. 11, 2013, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. PLM analysis identified lead white, bone black, iron oxides red-brown, yellow, burnt sienna, and red lake.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination as well as knowledge of Matisse\u2019s technique.\n\nDilution also extends the paint farther, if cost and availability are a concern.\n\nThe varnish was not analyzed.\n\nOther paintings by Matisse in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection that have overall varnishes likely applied by the artist are Woman on a Rose Divan (1921; cat. 33), Woman before an Aquarium (1921\u201323; cat. 34), Lemons on a Pewter Plate (1926; cat. 39), and Girl in Yellow and Blue with a Guitar (1939; cat. 46); and ones with partial varnishes likely applied by the artist are Laurette with Cup of Coffee (1916/17; cat. 26) and Daisies (1939; cat 47).\n\nSee Allison Langley, treatment report, 2008, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe reframing was part of a campaign corresponding with the opening of the Renzo Piano\u2013designed Modern Wing addition to the Art Institute in 2009.\n\nThis is the earliest documented frame for Matisse\u2019s Apples.\n\nMichel Dauberville and Guy-Patrice Dauberville, Matisse: Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune (\u00c9ditions Bernheim-Jeune, 1995), vol. 1, p. 558; and Centre Georges Pompidou, Henri Matisse 1904\u20131917, exh. cat.

Between Mar.\u2013June 1927, the gallery had multiple group exhibitions that overlapped in date and theme. In Art News, the exhibitions were called either \u201cExhibition of modern French and American paintings\u201d or \u201cGroup exhibition [of] modern French painters.\u201d The title of this exhibition is based on the one published in the Mar. 26, 1927, issue of Art News, under \u201cNew York Exhibition Calendar\u201d (p. 14). The same issue includes a review that mentions the presence of Apples in the current exhibition at F. Valentine Dudensing Galleries (p. 9). However, the review states that the exhibition includes \u201cpaintings by American and French modernists\u201d and thus conflicts somewhat with the title that only refers to French painters (p. 9). Opening date of the exhibition based on an F. Valentine Dudensing advertisement reproduced in Pierre Schneider, Pierre Matisse: Passeur Passionn\u00e9 (Hazan/Mona Bismarck Foundation, 2005), p. 176.
