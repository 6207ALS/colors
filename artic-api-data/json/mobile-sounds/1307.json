    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This English chair was made around 1810 after a design by Thomas Hope.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: He was not a cabinet maker himself but in fact a wealthy connoisseur and collector who designed the furnishings for his own house.  The chair takes its form from classical furniture, in particular, the Klismos chair.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The Klismos chair which it curving splayed legs and concave backrest often appears in Ancient Greek imagery, its form was revived in the late 18th Century when archeological discoveries in Italy and Greece fueled the Neoclassical movement in art, architecture and interior design.  The Hope Chair was originally designed to stand in a room displaying classical vases, so its outline may have echoed that of Klismos chairs illustrated on the vases exhibited around it.  Its inlaid decorations are also Greek in inspiration, a lyre appears on the chair back, the Greek key design adorns the seat base and palmettes representing the palms' fan-shaped leaves decorate the legs.  Hope's furniture designs were extremely influential, they were reinterpreted by architects and connoisseurs who visited his splendid London house and copied by cabinet from Hope's publication of his designs which appeared in 1807.</p>\n",
