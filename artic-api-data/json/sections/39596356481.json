Among them, eight intact blocks are from Gauguin\u2019s famed Noa Noa series of wood-block prints. The artist, before departing on his second journey to Tahiti, left these in Paris with his close friends and neighbors at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, William and Ida Molard; he returned to Tahiti with the two other blocks. These either broke or were deliberately disassembled along individual segments for reuse by the artist. Although it cannot be ascertained if this happened while the artist was in Paris or once back in Tahiti, he clearly used the smaller segments to create a series of smaller wood-block prints (see cat. 81, cat. 82, cat. 83, cat. 84, cat. 87, cat. 88, and cat. 89).\n\nThe present block, as well as nine others, were acquired by the artist\u2019s son Pola Gauguin in 1919 and were printed and published in 1921 in collaboration with the printing house of Christian Cato in Copenhagen. By the time this block was printed by Pola, superficial scratches had formed on its surface, which are visible in the posthumous impressions. The most pronounced of these is a diagonal scratch that extends from the top of the head of the central figure to the landscape articulated behind her, a vertical scratch through the body of the idol, and smaller nicks and dents that appear throughout the background.\n\nAfter the block was acquired for the Art Institute by the Print and Drawing Club (a museum support group), well-known artist and printmaker Max Kahn printed an edition that was made available to members of that group (see cat. 55.6). He also printed a group of seven impressions inked \u00e0 la poupee, seemingly for didactic purposes in emulation of Gauguin\u2019s methods. The current inking adds additional brushstrokes that detract from an accurate reading of the composition carved into the block. Instead, upon completion of Kahn\u2019s experimental printings of the block, it should have been coated with an opaque, visually contrasting water-soluble material, then inked in black to accurately articulate the appearance of the lines Gauguin carved and incised into his block (see cat. 60.1).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 55.1.1).\n\nBlack printing ink was selectively applied to the block after Max Kahn printed it in 1941. The ink was applied in such a way as to favor certain passages in the composition and to embellish others. Traces of orange media are present in the deepest interstices of the block; they are a mixture of chrome yellow and vermilion, perhaps orange ink residues left from Gauguin\u2019s printing of the block in one of his favored pigment combinations (see, for example, cat. 54.3).\n\nThe end-grain boxwood block is composed of seven individual segments of boxwood glued together and coated with a gray ground (see fig. 55.1.2). X-radiography was used to obtain an accurate count of the number of segments that were adhered together. The ground, applied in a later stage of the manufacturing process, was identified as zinc white (see fig. 55.1.3). Commercially produced blocks such as this one were often coated to provide a smooth, homogenous surface. The ground also provided visual contrast so that when the artist carved into the dark wood block, the incised and gouged lines would be readily visible against the light ground.\n\n204 \u00d7 353 \u00d7 23 mm\n\nWhile it is impossible to determine with complete certainty how Gauguin\u2019s composition evolved on the wood block, it is likely that the artist began by drawing with a sharp needle to lightly incise the block with all of the major forms. Thereafter, he used a series of gouges of various shapes and sizes to carve more deeply into the block. The most deeply gouged areas appear in the sky in the distant background, in the mango tree that surrounds the statue that is the focus of the composition, and in the vegetal forms in the foreground. Surface shape studies of a number of Gauguin\u2019s prints, monotypes, and transfer drawings in addition to this block were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light (see fig. 55.1.1). Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the various tool marks made by the artist using needles and a variety of gouges. The depth of these marks was also quantified to create an accurate three-dimensional surface reconstruction of the block to add in identifying the artist\u2019s tools. Gauguin used a combination of wood-engraving and woodcutting techniques on a block that was clearly manufactured for wood engraving. The hardness of the block precluded extremely deep carving, although it did afford him the opportunity to incise lines of varied depths throughout the working process. In fact, incised lines appear over gouged forms in several areas, among them the mango tree that follows the contour of the idol\u2019s profile.\n\nThere are two small holes in the back of the block that do not extend all the way through to the front. They are located at either end of the block at the centers of the vertical sides. Gauguin may have used them to secure the block to a solid surface to assure that it would not move during the printing process (fig. 55.1.4). Similarly placed holes can be found in other blocks of his as well. However, in the block used for Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her), also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (cat. 60.1), they are located toward the top rather than in the center of the block. By positioning the block onto nails or screws that protruded from a work surface, Gauguin could prevent it from shifting as he carved and printed it and therefore have greater control over the registration. Although these holes are not level with each other, they may have also been used for hanging purposes.\n\nWhen Gauguin printed this block, the ink rarely filled the interstices formed by his carving tools, and most often the carved lines appear as white passages in the prints. However, among the more experimentally printed impressions, some of the deeply carved lines instead appear as tonal passages. This resulted when the artist used a soft roller to partially deposit ink into gouged passages and then printed the block on a more supple paper that conformed to its contours to lift the ink from within them. In impressions where a single hard roller was used to deposit ink only on the highest points of the block, there is a greater contrast of light and dark, and some of the finest needle-incised lines fill with ink and are rendered unreadable.\n\nAmong all of the extant wood blocks manufactured by Kiessling and used by Gauguin for his Noa Noa Suite, this block remains the most structurally sound. The other blocks exhibit some degree of cracking along section joins as well as minimal deformation overall. This block is the only one that has a band of wood visible through the center of the block along all of the edges (fig. 55.1.5). Although undocumented, it appears that after the block was acquired, a spline of wood was inserted by cutting a channel one-eighth inch high by one-eighth inch deep along the center of the block and running the spline along all sides. Splines are commonly used to prevent cupping or cracking in larger pieces of wood, particularly those that are constructed from glued-together segments, and although the addition of a spline to an original Gauguin wood block is unusual and not something that would be done today, it ultimately did preserve the block\u2019s structural integrity.\n\nThe block is in sound, stable condition. The upper left corner is chipped along its depth with the exception of the thinner center spline. Small scratches in the gray ground reveal the darker wood underneath.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nElizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 49.\n\nTwo segments of the original wood block for Te faruru (Here We Make Love) are now in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague; the remaining segments are lost. Gauguin used the back of one fragment for Young Maoris (Kornfeld 39 [see cat. 87]). The wood block for Te atua is now lost but it has been suggested in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s prints and by others that the segments were used for Oviri (cat. 84) and Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (cat. 85); see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E.

There are traces of zinc white on the block for Noa Noa in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. At the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, analysis revealed the presence of stearic acid on two blocks, that for Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) and Auti te pape (Women at the River). We are grateful to Richard Newman and Annette Manick for providing this information from Newman\u2019s 2002 analytical report, via March 2015 email correspondence.

Residues of this pink paint can be found on the back of the block used for Maruru. Only one block, that for Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1), remains completely coated, although the coating is unstable and has partially flaked away from the wood surface. This may explain why the coating was removed from the remaining blocks. All of the known blocks were reinked in black, sometimes with additions of brown.\n\nC\u00e9line Daher, XRF and FTIR analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe reflectance transformation imaging (RTI)/photometric stereo research project was undertaken at the Northwestern University/Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts (NU-ACCESS), generously funded through a grant from the Andrew W.

Maurice Malingue, trans. Henry J. Stenning (World, 1949), p. 201, n. 1. Although this does not specifically mention the wood blocks from the Noa Noa Suite, it is probable that Gauguin possibly left the wood blocks with his neighbors, William and Ida Molard; see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E. Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 49.\n\nDruet lent eleven blocks (the eight left in Paris and another three sent back from Tahiti) to a 1918 exhibition in Stockholm. In 1919, they were sold to Pola Gauguin; see Elizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E.
