    "description": "<p>Salvador Dal\u00ed created <em>Anthropomorphic Tower</em> at a time in his career when he aligned himself with the Surrealists and began to produce dreamlike images charged with sexual desires and anxieties. This pastel relates to a painting of the same year called <em>The Great Masturbator</em> (now in the Museo nacional centro de arte Reina Sofia, Madrid). While in the painting the torso is clearly male and the head female, the pastel obfuscates each form\u2019s sexual identity. Here the palette on the right is more subdued, in contrast with the color of the tower-penis in the upper left, which is so bright as to appear almost spot lit. Dal\u00ed used the motif several times during this period. Could the figure with closed eyes on the right be dreaming or hallucinating the image of the <em>Anthropomorphic Tower&lt;.em&gt;? Dal\u00ed\u2019s image is open to interpretation, which is at the heart of Surrealist art.</p>\n",
