Inscribed above the mask is the name Dodeman, which could be the name of either the artist or the owner of the cannon. Skillfully chased and sculpted on a stippled ground are relief figures\u2014a warrior in classical armor holding a shield and wielding a sword, a figure of Fame standing on a helmet and breastplate under a canopy, and a figure of Victory. A rare feature of this finely cast and chased bronze cannon is the field carriage with old nails that appears to be original.</p>\n",
