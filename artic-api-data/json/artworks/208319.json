    "description": "<p>Milton Avery was an American artist known for his study and usage of color, often referred to as a precursor to Color Field painters. His work frequently bridged the gap between realist and abstract art. The four figures in <em>Conversation in the Studio</em> have not been identified; however, meetings like these were a common occurrence in both Avery\u2019s New York apartment and art studio. American artists such as Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb among others would often stop by to see and discuss Avery\u2019s work, while Avery in turn would sketch the gatherings and conversations taking place around him. The artist himself addressed this tendency, asking \u201cwhy talk when you can paint?\u201d The flat color fields and textured application of thin paint layers give shape and structure to the elegantly dressed figures and their surroundings. By the 1940s, Avery was increasingly using a nonnaturalistic palette to create mood in his paintings, as the bright-blue and green faces of the men demonstrate.</p>\n",
