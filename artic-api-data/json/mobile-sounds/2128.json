    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: To discuss this painting we have Sarah Kelly, a curator in the American Arts Department of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>SARAH KELLY: We're looking at the Study for the Hall of Medical Sciences Mural, that Ilya Bolotowsky created for the 1939 World's Fair, in New York City. We have one of the final studies for it. In 1939, the idea of doing abstract murals was completely new. And it's sort of amazing to consider that you would have on a national stage, a mural that wasn\u2019t representational, that didn\u2019t somehow highlight some sense of say, American progress or medical progress. But that you would have a completely abstract mural serving as artistic decoration. Bolotowsky was an initial member of a group called, &quot;The American Abstract Artists.&quot; In the 1930s American art is still very much characterized by figuration, by paintings like, for example, American Gothic. And suddenly these artists were looking at trends coming in from Europe of abstract art, and saying that they wanted to promote it as well in America. Bolotowsky at this time was working in abstraction that was both biomorphic, and as well geometric. So you see all these very sort of wonderful squiggly shapes, offset by squares and rectangles. I think very much the painting is supposed to represent nothing other than a form.</p>\n",
