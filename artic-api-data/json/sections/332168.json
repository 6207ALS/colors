The artist\u2019s wife, Beatrix Whistler, tends the flowers in a familiar plant stand that appears in many of the lithographs of their Paris garden as well as in The Garden (cat. 40), an 1891 image of friends gathered outdoors at their house on Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. In the background of the present image, Whistler sketched the tall casement windows of the house and, to the right, briefly indicated a fragment of the latticed portico that is seen more fully in The Garden Porch (cat. 88) and Man with a Sickle (cat. 89).\n\nWhistler drew La Belle Jardini\u00e8re on a sheet of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, mounted on a heavier secondary support, which he had obtained earlier in August from Lemercier and which he also used for La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99) and Confidences in the Garden (cat. 100). The rigid backing afforded Whistler the opportunity to use both the stump and the scraper on the surface of the fragile sheet, which would otherwise have been likely to tear. With stumping, he softened some of his drawn lines and added rich blacks to Beatrix\u2019s hat and dress. He also used a pointed stump to add soft gray tones to the figure, windowpanes, and foliage. A scraper was employed to lighten some of the hatched shadows, such as those on the ground to the left of the planter and in the casement windows and foliage at upper left.\n\nThe transfer drawing for this lithograph was probably sent to the Ways in London with The Duet (cat. 104) on or about 26 August 1894. T. R. Way wrote to Whistler on August 28 about returning proofs of two new, unnamed drawings, which he had received the previous day (letter 113). Letters that follow between artist and printer establish the identity of the two images (letter 114 and letter 116). Both Whistler and the Ways were delighted by La Belle Jardini\u00e8re and thought it technically successful; Whistler declared, \u201cThe result is excellent\u2014not too much stump\u201d (letter 118).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (314 \u00d7 200 mm), signed.
