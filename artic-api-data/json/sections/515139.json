A.D. 98\u2013117) was neither the first nor the last military man to rise to the imperial throne, but he was one of the most admirable. Called in from Upper Germany to protect the current emperor Nerva from the Praetorian Guard, who had become used to calling the tune in Rome, M. Ulpius Traianus fulfilled his duty and in return was adopted by Nerva as his heir. His success at governing Rome and the far-flung empire earned him a spontaneous acclamation by the Senate and the people of Rome as optimus princeps, the best prince, shortly after his initial conquest of Dacia (roughly Romania today) in A.D. 102. The Senate\u2019s gratitude may also have been due in part to Trajan\u2019s sensitive negotiation of the relationship between his vast powers as imperator and the Senate\u2019s traditional role in government. On this coin, a conquered Dacian slumps dejectedly at the foot of a trophy; around, the legend proclaims \u201cThe Senate and the people of Rome, to the best prince.\u201d The honorific dative suggests that this coin was being dedicated to Trajan in thanks for his expansion of the Roman Empire\u2014much like the inscription on Trajan\u2019s Column in Rome, which the Senatus populusque romanus also dedicated to the emperor (fig. 47.1). This coin probably was, like the column, inspired by the final conquest of Dacia in A.D. 105\u201306.\n\nThe obverse inscription too is in the dative case; in fact this can be read as a single legend, spilling over from obverse to reverse: \u201cTo Emperor Trajan: Augustus, Germanicus, Dacicus, pontifex maximus, [holder of] tribunician power, consul for the fifth time, pater patriae: the Senate and the people of Rome [dedicate this] to the best prince.\u201d The agnomen or nickname optimus, normally associated with Jupiter, was eventually conferred on Trajan as a formal title by the Senate in A.D. 114. This title appears on cat. 48, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Trajan.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">There may have been more to his accession than his reputation as a good general, as discussed in Eck, \u201cAn Emperor Is Made\u201d; and Bennett, Trajan, pp. 107\u201308.\n\nThe formula optimo princ[ipi] first appeared on the coinage in A.D. 103, after Trajan made it clear that he accepted the Senate as the legal source of imperial power: Bennett, Trajan, pp. 107\u201308. The Senate conferred the honor \u201cDacicus\u201d on Trajan in 102, though the military campaigns continued.\n\nThe column was dedicated in A.D. 113. At the time, Trajan was both imperator and consul for the sixth time, as the column\u2019s dedicatory inscription indicates (he became imperator for the sixth time in 106, consul for the sixth time in 112).\n\nTrajan was given a triumph for his pacification of Germany in A.D. 97. He was made consul for the fifth time in October 103 and was not consul for the sixth time until 112. This coin, which records him as consul for the fifth time (COS V), must therefore date to between these years.\n\nBennett, Trajan, p. 212.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 47 Denarius (Coin) Portraying Emperor Trajan, A.D. 103/11\n\nfig. 47.1 Decebalus (Braveheart) or King Diurapneus, Chief of the Dacians, Gathering His Men in a Fortress, from Trajan\u2019s column, A.D. 106/13.
