    "description": "<p>How can performance expand our understanding of art? Philippe Parreno\u2019s installation<em> My Room Is Another Fish Bowl</em> turns viewers into performers at the center of an ever-unfolding narrative\u2014one that that they script through their engagement with the installation. Join us for this talk, where scholar-producer Aymar Jean Christian argues that performance deepens art's connection to community and culture. Responding to the exhibition, he discusses how local, digital, community-based video production transforms viewers\u2019 relationship to art by inviting them inside it. </p><p>For three years Christian has explored the possibilities of television as a medium through OTV | Open Television, a research-based platform dedicated to developing Chicago artists and distributing their works online and across the city. The initiative has been recognized by HBO, the Emmy Awards, and the Tribeca Film Festival, and it has been exhibited at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, Brooklyn Museum, Frameline Film Festival, and New York Television Festival, among many others. </p><p>After a reading an excerpt from his book <em>Open TV</em>, which argues that the internet transformed television by opening it to new producers, viewers, and patrons, Christian will screen three experimental video works, each of which explores the performance of race, gender, and sexuality using different narrative techniques. </p><p><strong>About Artists Connect</strong></p><p>Artists Connect is a new series of in-gallery programs that highlight the creative process.
