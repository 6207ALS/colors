    "transcript": "<p>JAMES RONDEAU: The Penetrable is one of the great innovations of the first half of Helio\u2019s career, we\u2019re in 1960 and we\u2019re really at a halfway point here in this really important narrative arc. From taking color, geometry and surface from the wall into three-dimensional space.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: For Oiticica, the Penetrable, also called PN-1, with it\u2019s vibrant colors and sliding doors, was where the larger ideas of geometry, interactivity and - most importantly in this example - color, left the world of the visual and became manifested physically.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: What\u2019s maybe most important here about PN-1 is not so much the idea of participation, which we can trace almost everywhere in Helio\u2019s work, but here the idea of color, and the idea of immersion in color.</p>\n<p>So these yellows and oranges that you have here, they\u2019re intended not just to be colors on the wall, they\u2019re intended to do at least two things: they\u2019re intended to be color in motion as those plane\u2019s slide; they\u2019re intended then to be color that contains the body totally. So this is not being in a room with an orange or yellow wall, this is being in orange, this is being with yellow. He\u2019s thinking even from 1960 about color in a very, very poetic, complicated and fully bodily way.</p>\n",
