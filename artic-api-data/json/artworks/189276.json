    "description": "<p>Text printed on reverse of stereocard:<br></br></p>\n<p>The young ladies shown in this picture are employes of the accounting division of the cashier's office.  The Cashier's Department is one of the busiest departments in the house. All our patronage comes to us by mail in cash or its equivalent, and every penny of our great volume of business must be accounted for in the Cashier's Department.  We handle an average of 25,000 Post Office Money Orders, 3,300 Express Money Orders, and 5,000 checks, in addition to thousands of dollars in currency which our customers send us in registered mail, every day in this department.  It is here that the money is sorted, and checks, money orders and drafts listed and prepared for deposit in the several institutions which handle our banking deposits; and in this particular division shown in this view eighteen adding machines are in constant use preparing this work for banks.  In addition to handling cash received from our customers, the cashier's office makes all allowances to customers when it is necessary to return the customer's money because of our inability to fill his order if the goods are out of stock or have been damaged in transit, or for any other reason have failed to reach him.  It also handles the pay roll for more than 9,000 employes, and it keeps the accounts of the Employes' Savings Bank, conducted in the interest of the employes, paying 5 per cent interest compounded quarterly on the sums left on deposit by workers in the institution.  The cashier's office also handles the finances of the Seroco Mutual Benefit Association, deducting the monthly dues from each member's salary from month to month.  It would be very difficult indeed to itemize the many different accounts handled in the cashier's office, but in an institution employing 9,000 people and handling between $50,000,000.00 and $60,000,000.00 business in the course of a year, there are hundreds of employes who find their time fully occupied every hour of the day.</p>\n",
