While Tiffany &amp; Co. is the firm most celebrated for its Asian-inspired silver wares stemming from its gold-medal success at the 1878 Paris Exposition Universelle, Gorham is known to have been the first major American silver company to introduce Japanese designs into its product line; the earliest example of these is a series of four bowls executed in 1869, showing Westernized Japanese motifs of butterflies, bamboo, and Japanese screens.\n\nGorham\u2019s interpretation of Japanese compositions quickly evolved from straightforward adaptations of decorative motifs to more creative expressions unifying form and ornament. Writing in 1886, one critic suggested that the influence of Japan \u201ccan be traced very distinctly in many of the Gorham Company\u2019s patterns, but there is nothing slavish in the ready adoption of an idea.\u201d The Art Institute\u2019s tureen shows this transformation. Unlike the firm\u2019s early bowls, in which Japanese designs are legibly engraved on a standard object, this example comprises a fusion of wild elements that shape and adorn the vessel. Giant carp and a turtle thrash in violent waters, the turbulent scene rendered in deep repouss\u00e9. The undulating body articulates the movement of the sea, which is further enhanced by the cresting waves chased into the surface. This skillful manipulation of metal continues in the form of rippling water rushing over the bodies of the fish and turtle, obscuring the geometric patterns of skin and shell to emphasize the multidimensionality of the scene. The rim of the tureen ripples organically, supporting a raised lid that holds a cast-gilt crayfish, while other cast crustaceans also emerge from the churning waters. Gorham would continue to make elaborate and unique marine-themed objects into the late 1880s, including its Narragansett line, introduced the year after this tureen, featuring flatware encrusted with naturalistic cast and chased shells, seaweed, and other marine life.\n\nSilver designers were often inspired by printed sources, and those employed by Gorham were no exception. The firm maintained an extensive reference library for its staff. The library housed an array of Japanese books that were acquired as early as the 1860s; these included publications containing design patterns and photographs of the natural world, not to mention a number of illustrated volumes by the famed printmaker Katsushika Hokusai. While the exact source for the exuberant imagery on this tureen is not known, the diagonal orientation of the major decorative elements, the graphic delineation of the imagery, and the exaggerated features of the animals resonate with the inventive interpretation of the natural world found in a multivolume book of Hokusai\u2019s wood-block sketches represented in the Gorham library (see fig. 62.2).  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On base (fig. 62.3)\n\nEngraved on rim: Ida Macdonald October 24th 1883 (fig. 62.4)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">With Sotheby\u2019s (2016), lot 1209.\n\nSold to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2016.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">C.
