    "description": "<p>Frederic Remington crafted this scene of bloody confrontation for his white eastern audiences, who understood the West as a place of both danger and opportunity. An unseen Sioux warrior has shot a cavalry scout, who slumps over his horse while the troops behind him flee the ambush. A sculptor and illustrator as well as a painter, Remington was famous for his dynamic compositions of frontier life, which presented mythic, romanticized views of the American West in tantalizing color and detail. Although he traveled to western locations to sketch or gather material on assignment, he executed most of his work in his New York studio, including <em>The Advance-Guard</em>, which was later reproduced in <em>Harper\u2019s Weekly</em> alongside an article authored by the artist.</p>\n",
