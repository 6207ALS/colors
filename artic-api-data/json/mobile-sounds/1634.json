    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  This painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Correggio was made as a private devotional image.  It depicts the Madonna, who tenderly encircles the Christ Child on her lap, and the young St. John the Baptist with her arms.  Notice how Correggio paints her face.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:<br>Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:  There's a softness in the modeling, in the contours of the face, that's incredibly subtle and beautiful and really just captures a mood that's very peaceful and loving and gentle, and it's a meditative image, because when you look at her lids, she's looking down.  She's not looking at the viewer.  She's really thinking about the relationship to the Christ Child and to John the Baptist.<br />\nNarrator:  Mary's downward gaze suggests her knowledge of her son's fate.  Christ himself looks towards the other child, who holds a slender cross made of reeds, a visual reminder of the cross on which Christ will eventually die.  Meanwhile, the trellis behind Mary deepens the painting's symbolism.  Its citrus fruits are sometimes seen as emblems of faithfulness and love, but in their bitterness, they may also allude to Christ's future death and his mother's grief.&quot;</p>\n",
