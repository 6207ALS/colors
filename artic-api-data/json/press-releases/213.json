    "copy": " Tuesday, August 16, 2016   > CHICAGO\u2014 The Art Institute of Chicago is proud to announce a new digital interactive that empowers families to create their own one-of-a-kind journeys of the museum. Produced by the departments of Museum Education and Digital Experience and funded by the Woman\u2019s Board, JourneyMaker turns the process of planning\u2014and taking\u2014a family visit to the museum into a fun adventure.   >Available in the refreshed David and Marilyn Fatt Vitale Family Room of the Ryan Learning Center, and also accessible online, JourneyMaker presents eight possible story lines from which families can choose. For instance, they can imagine flying through the galleries like a superhero, traveling backward or forward in time, or discovering wondrous and wild beasts. With the aid of playful prompts, visitors pick works of art in the museum\u2019s collection and print their personalized tour. Each unique booklet is filled with creative ideas\u2014from drawing and writing prompts to acting games and conversation starters\u2014giving families ideas for looking at and responding to artworks together as a family in the physical space of the galleries.   > Jacqueline Terrassa , Woman\u2019s Board Endowed Chair of Museum Education, shared \u201cBy making the Art Institute feel welcoming, accessible, and playful, we wanted to empower families to make the museum their own and discover art in the galleries, together. Parents often see art museums as places filled with beautiful things that children can\u2019t touch. JourneyMaker allows families to connect with art in open-ended ways with a unique blend of digital and physical interaction.\u201d   >With 260,000 possible journey combinations, the museum is never the same place twice. Whether families are first time visitors or frequent museum-goers, they discover the Art Institute afresh each time with JourneyMaker.   >The Family Room is open daily from 10:30-5:00, with the exception of a few holiday dates.
