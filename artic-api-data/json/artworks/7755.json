    "description": "<p>An artist with an adventurous spirit, Rockwell Kent traveled widely, gravitating to such harsh and snowy locales as Alaska, Greenland, Newfoundland, and New England for his painted landscapes. Kent set up a small shack to use as a studio in remote Vermont, which he described as a \u201chandy refuge for a frozen realist.\u201d It was there that he captured this view of Mount Equinox in winter, one of a group of paintings that he executed of the peak at different seasons. Although grounded in realism, Kent\u2019s landscapes are not straightforward transcriptions of the natural world; rather, they are harmonious compositions featuring simplified forms, vivid colors, sharp contrasts, and astute design.</p>\n",
