    "description": "<p>In 1872, James McNeill Whistler began a large-scale portrait of Scottish historian and philosopher Thomas Carlyle, who lived near the artist in London. Whistler executed several studies, including this one, which strongly resembles the finished painting. Carlyle endured numerous sittings, as Whistler labored over the portrait with particular emphasis on the aesthetics of the sitter\u2019s black coat. Concerned with harmonious arrangements of color and form, the artist was less interested in depicting the details of Carlyle\u2019s face. The composition is strikingly similar to Whistler\u2019s <em>Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Artist\u2019s Mother</em> (1871; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay), also known as <em>Whistler\u2019s Mother</em>.</p>\n",
