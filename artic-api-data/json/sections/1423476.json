Glasgow: HAG, RBP lifetime stamp.  \nSheets of same paper found with signature.  \nIvory laid paper, avg. sheet size 327 \u00d7 207 mm. Removed from book; some sheets with gray cast from accumulated surface dirt; sew holes visible in untrimmed bound edge. Used by Way for 1895\u201396 Fine Art Society printing. Ref.: Heawood 3466.  \nWatermark 320\n\nLifetime  \nCat. 117. Chicago: AIC, 1917.609, signed.  \nIvory laid paper, avg. sheet size 384 \u00d7 250 mm. Removed from book; often cut in half through part of watermark; accumulated surface dirt; sew holes visible in untrimmed bound edge; 3 edges deckled. Similar variant of watermark in sheets of visually identical paper probably removed from same book: not ill. (chain lines spaced differently and position of mark along those chain lines differs).  \nWatermark 321\n\nPosthumous  \nCat. 69. Glasgow: HAG.  \nSheets of same paper found with RBP posthumous stamp.  \nIvory to cream laid paper, avg. sheet size 181 \u00d7 246 mm, full sheet size approx. 360 mm in the vertical direction. Removed from book; all known sheets cut in half through center of watermark and countermark; blue ink along 3 edges.  \nWatermark 322\n\nProbably posthumous  \nCat. 126. Glasgow: HAG.  \nIvory laid paper, sheet size 290 \u00d7 203 mm (only example known). Removed from book; fibrous; unusual chain-line pattern; edges slightly discolored; red ink along top edge. Possible related paper: no. 328.  \nWatermark 323\n\nProbably posthumous  \nCat. 155. Glasgow: HAG.  \nLight brown laid paper, sheet size 181 \u00d7 304 mm (only example known). Loose sheet (contemporary); perhaps cut into thirds.  \nWatermark 324\n\nLifetime  \nCat. 26. Chicago: MWC, 54.1984.  \nTan laid paper, avg. sheet size 311 \u00d7 227 mm. Loose sheets; cut into quarters; 2 edges deckled, discolored. Also used for etchings in 1879 (for example, Chicago: AIC, K I79).  \nWatermark 325\n\nPosthumous  \nCat. 44. Chicago: AIC, 1917.670, only printed posthumously.  \nIvory wove paper, sheet size 246 \u00d7 166 mm (only example known). Loose sheets; one side smoother than the other and used for printing. Used by Way in 1904 for cat. 44, which was only printed posthumously (similar to proofing papers used years earlier, during Whistler\u2019s lifetime, although this sheet is heavier and with a coarser surface texture).  \nWatermark 326\n\nPosthumous  \nCat. 164. Washington: NGA, 1943.3.8773, RBP posthumous stamp.  \nCream Japanese paper, avg. sheet size 360 \u00d7 228 mm. Loose sheets; medium weight, heavily sized; distinctive mold pattern in which fine lines run in only one direction. Used by Goulding; probably chosen for its visual similarity to the \u201cwove\u201d Japanese vellum used during Whistler\u2019s lifetime, although it is yellower and of inferior quality.  \nWatermark 327\n\nPosthumous  \nCat. 30. Cleveland: CMA, 1941.626, RBP posthumous stamp.  \nIvory laid paper, avg. sheet size 230 \u00d7 204 mm. Loose sheets; cut in halves and quarters; distinctive mold pattern in which chain-line intervals regularly alternate from 5\u20136 mm in length to 12\u201313 mm in length. Used by Goulding. Possible related paper: no. 323.  \nWatermark 328\n\nLifetime  \nCat. 61. Chicago: AIC, 1917.658, signed.  \nIvory wove proofing paper, avg. sheet size 319 \u00d7 257 mm. Distinctive mold flaw in which a series of parallel lines run along the width of the sheet, where wires crossed the mesh mold to sew 2 sections together. This flaw readily identifies papers in which it is found as lifetime. Used by Way.  \nWatermark 329\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\"> Watermark 166 HN countermark to Basle crozier surrounded by shields of the twelve cantons of the Helvetian Confederation (nos. 41, no. 42) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 167 Hodgki [?] (partial) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 168 C &amp; I Honig countermark to fleur de lys (no. 127) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 169 C &amp; I Honig countermark (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 170 [C &amp; I Hon]ig (partial) countermark (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 171 J Honig &amp; Zoon with hunting horn in shield (partial; bottom) with HR countermark (partial; top) (no. 177) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 172 Horn in oval (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 173 Horse, rearing (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 174 Horse, rearing (partial), with G countermark (no. 153) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 175 HP in shield (partial; bottom) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 178 HS countermark to arms of Amsterdam (no. 13) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 179 Hunting horn in shield (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 180 Hunting horn in shield (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 181 Hunting horn in shield/HG (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 182 Hunting horn in shield (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 183 Hunting horn in shield (partial; top) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 184 Hunting horn in shield (partial; top) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 185 Hunting horn in shield (partial; bottom) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 186 Hunting horn in shield, Vander Ley (partial; bottom) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 187 IHS with cross in circle (partial; top) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 188 IMC countermark (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 189 IT countermark (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 190 IV countermark to Seven Provinces (no. 272) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 191 IV countermark to Seven Provinces (no. 273, no. 274) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 192 IV countermark (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 193 IV countermark (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 194 IV countermark to arms of Amsterdam (no. 14) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 195 IV countermark to Pro Patria (no. 238) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 196 IV countermark to Strasbourg lily/LVG (no. 289, no. 290) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 197 IV countermark to Strasbourg lily/LVG (no. 289, no. 290) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 198 IVDL countermark to Pro Patria (no. 232, no. 233, no. 234, no. 235, no. 236) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 199 Ivhledary countermark to Strasbourg lily/WR/GVH (no. 300) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 200 IW with flower countermark to tree/AB in elaborated shield (no. 305, no. 306) (lifetime and posthumous)\n\nWatermark 201 W King/Alton Mill; 190 mm in length, chain-line interval: 26 mm (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 202 Kloppenburg countermark (partial) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 203 Landi countermark (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 204 Lion countermark to arms of Bollo Reale Toscano (no. 27, no. 28) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 205 Lion countermark to arms of Bollo Reale Toscano (no. 27, no. 28) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 206 Lion countermark to arms of Bollo Reale Toscano (no. 27, no. 28) (lifetime)\n\nWatermark 207 L VI<sup>E</sup> (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 208 LVG countermark (partial; top) to foolscap, 7-pointed collar (no. 150) (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 209 MBM (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 210 M/BM with clover (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 211 M and C flanking lion in shield (posthumous)\n\nWatermark 212 FF.
