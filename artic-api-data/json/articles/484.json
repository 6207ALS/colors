    "title": "French Anteroom of the Empire Period",
    "copy": " This Thorne Miniature Room was designed in the haute Empire style, reflecting the lavish and elaborate Neoclassical tastes of Napoleon, the reigning emperor. The green Roman columns on the walls, the use of materials like marble and simulated gilded bronze, and the stately severity of the lines were all hallmarks of this architectural and decorative style. And there are Napoleonic references everywhere. Emblems related to the emperor\u2014like eagles, bees, laurel wreaths, and the letter \u201cN\u201d\u2014 were often included in rooms like this one. In this case, check out the laurel wreaths in the ornamentation above each set of doors. A bust of Napoleon also watches over the room from the mantle and as you look down the fireplace in the detail below, you\u2019ll see images of the sphinx, which also pop up on chairs and tables throughout the room. According to Mrs. Thorne (who conceived of the rooms) herself, Napoleon\u2019s campaign in Egypt resulted in \u201ca perfect orgy of Egyptian design.\u201d The bold colors also reflect the prevailing style of the early 19th century. Color schemes that included gold, black, and crimson were popular and in this room, the niche is painted in Pompeiian red and the chairs and curtains in a shade of green called \u201cEmpire.\u201d The rug was also copied for a portfolio of designs for rugs that Napoleon commissioned for the palace of Fontainebleau. But style often comes at a price. As Mrs. Thorne said, \u201cIt lacks [a] livable quality, but it is 100 percent Napoleonic, and that is what I was striving for.\u201d \u2014Katie Rahn ",
