This is generally considered to be a reference to Dorothy Seton, a young woman who is documented as having modeled for Whistler in London in the period 1902\u201303. The drawing was never transferred to stone during the artist\u2019s lifetime. It was processed for the first time in 1903 when Birnie Philip had Goulding print a posthumous edition.\n\nThe sitter in this portrait bears some resemblance to the young woman depicted in Whistler\u2019s 1903 painting Dorothy Seton\u2014A Daughter of Eve (YMSM 552). Nevertheless, there are several reasons to question the identity of the subject of this lithograph as the young red-haired Irish woman whom the Pennells first encountered in Whistler\u2019s studio in October 1902. First, there is the question of dating; there is absolutely no evidence that Whistler made any lithographs after the end of 1897, nor does he seem to have used Dorothy Seton as a model before 1902. Second, there is the matter of technique and materials. The drawing was made on thin French papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. After his break with the Ways, Whistler\u2019s lithographic activity centered in Paris, where he could obtain this transfer paper easily and could rely upon the expertise of printers like Lemercier and Auguste Clot to process the transfer drawings made upon it correctly. The artist\u2019s use of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal strongly suggests that he drew the image in Paris. Even if Whistler had known Dorothy Seton as early as 1897, it is unlikely that she modeled for him anywhere but in London.\n\nThe portrait is rendered in a technique that is uncommon among Whistler\u2019s lithographs. Stumping has been used extensively to create a soft gray underlayer over which further drawing and stumping have been added. This elaborate layering technique resulted in a sfumato effect that finds its closest comparison in The Shoemaker (cat. 169), a lithograph that is firmly documented as having been drawn in France in early January 1897. If, as is suggested above, this portrait of a seated young woman was drawn in Paris at about the same time, it becomes far more likely that the sitter is one of the Birnie Philip sisters or a friend who visited the family at their residence on the rue du Bac. Indeed, the image is much closer in character to the intimate portraits Whistler drew of his late wife\u2019s family during 1897 than to works he created in the studio using professional models, raising the possibility that the \u201cMiss Seton\u201d identified by Rosalind Birnie Philip was a social acquaintance.\n\nWhistler was in Paris with the Birnie Philips for the first two weeks of January 1897. During that stay he made transfer drawings for The Shoemaker (cat. 169) and The Medici Collar (cat. 170), which he turned over to the Lemercier firm for processing and printing on January 6. The artist was back in London by January 14, when he wrote to Rosalind Birnie Philip in Paris asking her to send him the proofs immediately. When he still had received nothing two days later, he wrote again asking: \u201cWhy do you keep me waiting for my lithographs? It is very unkind of you! I think I shall make you no more little drawings!\u201d His reference to \u201cno more little drawings\u201d would seem to suggest that during his last sojourn in Paris Whistler had made several sketches of Rosalind or other members of the family in addition to The Medici Collar. The two drawings formerly thought to depict Dorothy Seton (cat. 171, cat. 172) may have been among those \u201clittle drawings\u201d created in January 1897 and set aside upon Whistler\u2019s departure for England.\n\nChicago: SC, cream laid paper (249 \u00d7 187 mm).

Joseph Pennell first encountered Dorothy Seton in Whistler\u2019s studio on 20 October 1902. Pennell recalled that Dorothy Seton\u2014Daughter of Eve (YMSM 552; Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow) was painted one afternoon in May 1903. The circumstances surrounding Whistler\u2019s creation of this portrait, which the Pennells described as \u201cthe last important picture he painted,\u201d are also recounted in Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, p. 291.\n\nMargaret MacDonald suggested that Dorothy Seton may be the subject of a small portrait sketch drawn on the back of a letter written to Whistler by the secretary of the Chelsea Arts Club on 13 August 1895; MacDonald (1995), p. 516, no. 1435. If this identification is correct, it would indicate that Whistler knew Seton a good seven years earlier than the Pennells\u2019 account suggests. Because the woman in the sketch of 1895 looks more mature than Dorothy Seton appears to be in the portrait of 1903, however, it is difficult to accept the identification.\n\nRatier to Lawson, 10 March 1904, GUL BP II 12/34.

Cat. 171 and cat. 172 were almost certainly drawn in the same period; areas within both images reveal a pattern of 5 parallel vertical lines spaced almost 5 mm apart, indicating that Whistler utilized the same drawing surface when sketching the two portraits. Papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal is known for its thin, textureless surface; artists often placed it over cloth book covers or textured papers in order to \u201cgive some tooth\u201d to their transfer drawings. See cat. 58, cat. 59, cat. 60, and cat. 121 for further discussion of Whistler\u2019s exploitation of the effect.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 171, only state.
