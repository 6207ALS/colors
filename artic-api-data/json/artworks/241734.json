    "description": "<p>In ancient Roman legend, during the war between Rome and the city of Alba Longa, two groups of three brothers were chosen to fight to the death for each side. The Horatii family fought for the Romans, the Curiatii for the Albans. The Horatii defeated the Curiatii, although only one of the Horatii survived. Upon discovering that his sister Camilla was secretly betrothed to one of the dead Curiatii, the surviving brother angrily killed her for placing personal love above patriotism.<br>Garnier\u2019s ambitious drawing depicts the execution of Camilla, emphasizing the event\u2019s tragedy. Though her brother stands on an elevated platform, the dying Camilla has pride of place, spotlit and surrounded by mourners. In its strong line, lack of color, and shallow space, the drawing reflects the impact ancient Roman sculptural reliefs had  on Garnier.</p>\n",
