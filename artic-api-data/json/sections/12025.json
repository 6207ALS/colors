He left London armed with a commission from the Fine Art Society to produce twelve etchings of Venetian scenes, a \u00a3150 advance to cover living expenses, and an array of art materials. However, shortly after his arrival the city suffered its worst winter in thirty years; Whistler wrote to his sister-in-law Nellie, \u201cIt is of a cold you have no idea\u2014cold way beyond anything I know in London.\u201d The copperplates he worked on were \u201clike ice,\u201d making progress on the etchings difficult. Partly out of necessity, he turned to pastel, a medium more conducive to the challenging working conditions. Like the etching needles and plates, the materials he used for his pastel drawings were portable, enabling him to continue to work outdoors. Fellow artist Otto Henry Bacher, who became closely acquainted with Whistler that winter, recalled, \u201cHe always carried two boxes of pastels, an older one for instant use, filled with little bits of strange, broken colors of which he was very fond, and a newer box with which he did his principal work.\u201d Whistler\u2019s poverty and the need to live frugally may help explain this curious practice of carrying around an extra, older box of pastel fragments, but Bacher\u2019s anecdote also testifies to the artist\u2019s almost sentimental attachment to his materials. He drew with these on brown paper he had brought with him from London, as well as on other colored papers obtained in Venice.\n\nWhistler struggled at first to find inspiration for his art among the city\u2019s seemingly endless sources of material. Depictions of Venice\u2019s historic sights were enormously popular in Victorian England, and many noted artists and writers, including Whistler\u2019s adversary John Ruskin, had turned to the subject. Their portraits of the city in turn drew upon iconic images from the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by artists such as Antonio Canaletto (1697\u20131768), whose views of Venice\u2019s monuments were especially admired by British audiences. Rather than revisiting these well-worn motifs, Whistler instead looked to the city\u2019s backstreets, quiet canals, and unusual architectural features. Writing to the director of the Fine Art Society in January 1880, he excitedly pronounced, \u201cnow I have learned to know a Venice in Venice that the others never seem to have perceived.\u201d\n\nHis use of pastels for these subjects was unorthodox. In the nineteenth century pastels were popular\u2013\u2013particularly in France\u2013\u2013for portraiture, but not necessarily for finished landscapes or cityscapes. Prior to Venice, Whistler had mainly confined his use of the medium to sketches of figures and studies for portraits. His technique also flew in the face of convention. Instead of following the usual practice of covering the paper in thick, blended layers of the powdery medium, Whistler\u2019s approach was remarkably subtle, using color sparingly and leaving much of the paper visible. In fact, the paper becomes a color of equal importance to the composition as the pastels themselves. Though Whistler\u2019s technique in the Venice pastels is in some respects very similar to his chalk-and-pastel figure drawings (see Study for \u201cArrangement in Black, No. 2: Portrait of Mrs. Louis Huth,\u201d cat. 14; and A Nude Figure, cat. 18), the ambition of the Venice works far exceeds that of those earlier efforts. He was well aware of his pastels\u2019 radical novelty, declaring them \u201csomething so new in Art that every body\u2019s mouth will I feel pretty soon water.\u201d Even after the weather turned warmer and he could resume work on his etchings, Whistler continued to make new pastel pictures, often switching between the two mediums over the course of a day.\n\nCorte del Paradiso exemplifies the Venice pastels in both its subject and its application of materials. The setting is a small, ordinary courtyard off the Ruga Giuffa in the Castello district that is still in existence (fig. 22.1). Alastair Grieve describes it as a narrow, dark court surrounded by four- and five-story houses, and Margaret MacDonald notes that the area was decidedly working-class in Whistler\u2019s day. It is therefore far from the type of scenic view of Venice to which Victorians were most accustomed. Whistler\u2019s drawing captures the vantage point of a person standing at one end of the courtyard and looking down toward the facing facade at the far end, with the heaviest treatment concentrated on this most physically distant area of the composition. It renders many of the space\u2019s architectural features, focusing attention on the repeating geometric patterns created by doorways, windows, and shutters. The vertical sweep of the tall buildings and the narrowness of the courtyard are further accentuated by the narrow dimensions of the paper. He balanced his emphasis on architecture with human details\u2014the two children walking toward the viewer at left, the woman holding a baby in a doorway at right, and the colorful clothes hanging from various windows to dry\u2013\u2013that define this as an inhabited space. This combined interest in architectural geometry and everyday humanity places Whistler\u2019s Venice works in dialogue with genre subjects by other artists, particularly those of Dutch school painters such as Johannes Vermeer (1632\u20131675) and Pieter de Hooch (1629\u20131684) (see fig. 22.2 and fig. 22.3).\n\nIn his memoir, With Whistler in Venice, Bacher recounts Whistler\u2019s drawing methods for the Venice pastels in detail: \u201cIn beginning a pastel he drew his subject crisply and carefully in outline with black crayon upon one of these sheets of tinted paper which fitted the general color of the motive. . . . He was never in a hurry in his work, always careful, and accomplished much. Some motives were finished at one sitting, but more often he made only the crayon outline, charming in its effect, leaving the unfinished sketch for days at its most fascinating point, to be filled in later with pastels. Many times these outlines needed very little color to complete them.\u201d Whistler drew Corte del Paradiso on one of the sheets of brown paper from his original supply, brought over from London. The customary black-crayon outlines are readily apparent here, and, as Bacher observes, the colored pastels are employed to describe the spaces between these lines, enlivening without effacing them. Whistler\u2019s unusually delicate handling of the colored pastels is especially notable in the broad sweep of white that covers the building at the center of the composition. The pastel skims lightly across the surface, drawing attention to the paper\u2019s rough texture and subtly evoking the crumbling plaster of the building\u2019s facade. Small notes of jewel-bright color animate the expanse of white, yet even these are applied sparingly, leaving much of the brown paper visible underneath. With his use of color, Whistler created a nuanced visual interplay between repetition and variety, weaving some colors throughout the composition while concentrating others, such as the bright-blue washing hanging from one window at left, in one or two specific areas on the sheet. One result of his subtle yet vibrant application of line and color is that it invites the eye to meander through the scene and discover its charming quotidian details. In effect, it replicates the experience of a tourist\u2019s encounter with a typical Venice backstreet.\n\nHaving well overstayed the Fine Art Society\u2019s original three-month assignment, Whistler returned to London in November of 1880 with around fifty etchings and over one hundred pastels, along with assorted drawings, watercolors, and oil paintings. A few months later, in January 1881, fifty-three of the pastels were shown at the Fine Art Society. As Lynne Bell has observed, the indeterminate status of the pastel medium in the British art world at the time made an exhibition dedicated to these works a daring venture. The gamble paid off; the show was a critical and financial success. Many critics were taken aback by Whistler\u2019s unprecedented use of pastel, but most praised his originality and applauded the works\u2019 reflection of \u201cthe true Venice that we all know\u2014\u2018second-hand,\u2019 dirty and everlastingly lovely.\u201d One reviewer commented, \u201ca man is said to \u2018find himself\u2019 when he hits on the right mode of expressing what genius he may have in him. In his \u2018Venice Pastels\u2019 at the Fine Art Company\u2019s Rooms in Bond-street, Mr. Whistler has emphatically \u2018found himself.\u2019\u201d The accolades were especially welcome given that Whistler\u2019s exhibition of twelve Venice etchings, which had taken place a month earlier, had not received such a warm reception.\n\nAttendees of the exhibition also admired the gallery\u2019s d\u00e9cor, which Whistler had conceived to complement the pastels. In addition, Whistler designed the drawings\u2019 frames to minimize the amount of empty space left visible around the edges, which intensified their visual impact (fig. 22.4; [M 758]). An inscription along the lower left side of Corte del Paradiso records the precise dimensions specified for its original frame. One admiring gallerygoer sketched all fifty-three of the pastels exhibited\u2013\u2013Corte del Paradiso, entitled \u201cCourtyard\u201d in the exhibition catalogue, appears as number fifty-two (fig. 22.5). An original Venice Pastels exhibition catalogue from the Brewster Collection of Whistleriana now in the collection of the Ryerson and Burnham Libraries also contains pencil sketches of many of the works on display, including Corte del Paradiso (fig. 22.6). Priced at 25 guineas, it was one of the more affordable drawings on offer. Whistler, for his part, was reported to \u201c[fear] his pastels are not so good as he supposed\u2013\u2013for they are selling.\u201d\n\nDespite the triumph of the Fine Art Society exhibition, pastel did not begin to gain popularity in Britain as an artistic medium until later in the decade. This slow acceptance may partially explain why Whistler never attempted another project of this scale in pastel again. However, he may have simply felt that the Venice works represented an end in and of themselves, for, as he described to a friend, \u201cthe whole thing will be just a continuation of my own art work, some portions of which complete themselves in Venice.\u201d\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Corte del Paradiso corresponds to Margaret F.

However, the financial strain placed on the artist by the higher-than-anticipated building costs, poor sales of his work, and his expensive lawsuit against John Ruskin, forced him to declare bankruptcy. In May 1879 he turned over possession of his home to bailiffs, who used the proceeds from the sale of the house to pay his creditors.\n\nThomas R. Way writes that Whistler took with him to Venice \u201ca box of new copperplates and etching materials, which my father [the printer Thomas Way] gave him, and also a supply of a special brown paper, which we had been fortunate enough to find, and upon which were drawn the greater part of the pictures shown in the Venice pastels.\u201d T.

He also points out that the Pennells cite the work of the \u201cOld Masters\u201d as inspiration for Whistler\u2019s Venice works. See Grieve, Whistler\u2019s Venice, 35\u201336; and Pennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 1:276. Furthermore, one contemporary reviewer of the Venice pastels exhibition noted that the play of light in one of the works on display \u201ccarries one away to the works of the Dutchman De Hooghe now to be seen at the Royal Academy.\u201d See \u201cMr. Whistler\u2019s \u2018Venice Pastels,\u2019\u201d Artist 2, no. 15 (Mar. 1, 1881): 72. As Nigel Thorp notes, Whistler owned a photograph of Vermeer\u2019s View of Houses in Delft, Known as The Little Street (fig. 2). The photograph was taken in 1902, well after Whistler\u2019s time in Venice, but, as Thorp observes, it confirms the artist\u2019s \u201clifelong attachment to the Dutch school.\u201d See Nigel Thorp, \u201cStudies in Black and White: Whistler\u2019s Photographs in Glasgow University Library,\u201d Studies in the History of Art 19.\n\nBacher, With Whistler in Venice, 75\u201376.\n\nMacDonald, Palaces in the Night, 44\u201345.\n\nMargaret MacDonald has compiled a full list of the works produced in Venice.

Grischka Petri has questioned the Pennells\u2019 total, but nevertheless estimates that, \u201cmeasured against his previous exhibitions, the pastel show was extremely successful.\u201d See Maud Franklin to Otto Henry Bacher, Mar. 21, 1881, GUW, no. 11621; Pennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 1:293\u201394; and , 409\u201310.
