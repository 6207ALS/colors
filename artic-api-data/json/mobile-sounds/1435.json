    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Karen Manchester is the museum\u2019s curator of ancient art.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: Numerous copies of the Aphrodite of Knidos has survived from Roman time. We don\u2019t have the original statue which was made in the fourth century B.C. by an artist named Praxiteles. And the people of Knidos purchased the statue and displayed it in a temple that was located sort of high on the island and it could be seen from distance by sailors on boats. And it was enormously popular in antiquity. It made quite a sensation in its own time because it was the representation of a goddess completely bereft of clothing which was something that was a very daring scheme on the part of Praxiteles. It was very risky of him to have done so.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Aphrodite of Knidos ranks as the first nude female sculpture in classical Greek art.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: But it became one of the most popular sculptures among the Romans but not for placement in a temple as the Greeks had done but actually as a piece of garden sculpture. So there is a reuse or an appropriation of the iconography but a use for different purposes.</p>\n",
