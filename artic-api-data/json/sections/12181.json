Brewster, 1933.296\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">The first major portrait commission James McNeill Whistler received upon his return from Venice was for three full-length oil portraits of Valerie Susan Meux, later Lady Meux. The first of the three, Arrangement in Black: Lady Meux (fig. 23.1; [YMSM 228]), presents its model sumptuously attired in an elegant black dress, luxuriant fur wrap, and glittering diamonds. The focus of the Art Institute\u2019s sketch, as with many of Whistler\u2019s drawings for or after his oil portraits (see Sketch after \u201cArrangement in Brown and Black: Portrait of Miss Rosa Corder,\u201d cat. 20; and Study for \u201cThe Blue Girl: Portrait of Miss Elinor Leyland,\u201d cat. 21), is on specifics of costume and the positioning of the figure. Almost no attention is paid to the sitter\u2019s features. The sketch was previously thought to be a preparatory study for the oil portrait. However, the just-visible butterfly in the dense black background to the left of the figure appears to be a direct reference to the artist\u2019s signature in the painting. This suggests that the drawing was actually more likely made after the portrait was completed and helps explain the presence of a second butterfly in the left margin, which is unique to the drawing. As a sketch done from the completed painting, the drawing reveals which of the picture\u2019s details Whistler found most noteworthy.\n\nWhistler\u2019s electric draftsmanship animates the figure\u2019s stately stance, breathing life into her faceless form. The vigorous, slashing lines of the pen suggest that the artist drew quickly and freely, and yet even here the material evidence of Valerie Meux\u2019s affluence is decidedly on display. The jagged pen lines are particularly well suited to accentuate the rich tactility of the plush white fur. The uniformly dark tone of the dress matches the heavily worked background, causing the fur\u2013\u2013the unmarked paper\u2013\u2013to appear even lighter in contrast. This play of light and dark hints at the oil painting\u2019s dominant harmony of white and black. Though Meux\u2019s physical attributes are not well defined, she is well adorned\u2013\u2013in addition to the fur, her blank visage is ornately framed by a diamond tiara and necklace. Her husband had purchased the jewelry for an extravagant sum (\u00a310,000) as his wedding gift to her, creating an uproar in his family.\n\nThe Meux commission was advantageous for both artist and sitter. Valerie Susan Langdon had married Henry Bruce Meux, the heir to a vast brewery fortune and, later, 3rd baronet, in 1878. Prior to her marriage, Meux had been known in London as Val Reece, a denizen of the seedy dance hall Casino de Venise and the live-in companion of a Colonel Reece. The marriage met with strident disapproval from her husband\u2019s family; though it provided Meux with all the trappings of wealth and status, it did not gain her access to \u201cpolite society.\u201d Having her portrait painted by a well-known artist therefore presented an opportunity for Meux to, in Susan Grace Galassi\u2019s words, \u201c[construct] an image that would confirm through art a status that was denied her in real life.\u201d Whistler\u2019s friend Thomas R. Way aptly described Arrangement in Black: Lady Meux as her \u201cstate portrait.\u201d As the emphases of the Art Institute sketch underscore, this calculated self-depiction was rooted in conspicuous luxury and aestheticized sophistication.\n\nWhistler, for his part, was still struggling to regain his footing following his notorious legal quarrel with the art critic John Ruskin. Whistler\u2019s friend Th\u00e9odore Duret later acknowledged it was \u201can act of courage to let oneself be painted by Whistler\u201d at the time. The Meux commission was therefore not only lucrative, but also represented an occasion for Whistler to reassert his standing as a portrait painter of the monied elite. Recognizing their common outsider status, Lady Meux wrote to the artist, \u201cYou and I always get on well together . . . I suppose we are both a little eccentric and not loved by all the world, personally I am glad of it as I should prefer a little hate.\u201d This sentiment must have rung true to a man who would eventually write a book dedicated to, as he ironically put it, \u201cthe gentle art of making enemies.\u201d\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Sketch after \u201cArrangement in Black: Lady Meux\u201d corresponds to Margaret F.

She notes elsewhere, however, with reference to the sketches Whistler made of all three oil portraits planned of Valerie Meux, \u201cthere is no way to distinguish them from sketches done after the portrait when it was more or less completed.\u201d See Margaret F. MacDonald, \u201cArrangement in Black\u2014No. 3,\u201d in Richard Dorment and Margaret F. MacDonald, James McNeill Whistler, exh. cat.

The sum of \u00a310,000 was the total cost of all the jewelry bought by Henry Meux at the time of their wedding, which included Valerie Meux\u2019s entire parure.
