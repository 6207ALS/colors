A two-part plaster mold would have been made from the soft clay version, likely by a professional mold maker. The model would almost certainly have been damaged or destroyed when the mold was removed. From this waste mold a plaster version of the artwork was then cast, which a professional mold maker would use to carefully produce a piece mold for sand casting.\n\nThe bronze edition of Small Crouching Nude without an Arm was sand-cast by October 1909 at Bingen &amp; Costenoble, Paris. It has a dark, rather reddish-brown patina. X-rays of the object show evidence of the casting and of a repair made during the casting.\n\nSigned: HM 2/10 (proper left thigh) (fig. 14.1)\n\nBronze (an alloy of primarily copper and tin). ICP-OES analysis was conducted on a sample (see fig. 14.2).\n\nSand cast.\n\nBingen &amp; Costenoble, Paris.\n\nDark, rather reddish-brown patina, modulating to lighter reddish-brown at high areas.\n\nThere are traces of tan, sandy core material in the interior (fig. 14.3). X-rays of the object (see fig. 14.4) show prominent mold lines, some recessed, up the sides and possibly in the face, on the proper left leg and on the proper right ankle. A threaded plug is visible in the interior top of head; this is a typical foundry method of repairing casting flaws.\n\nThere is a copper-alloy plate on the underside, brazed in place, into which three mounting screws have been set. A central, long screw, penetrates the black stone base with which it entered the collection, and two short side screws prevent rotation on the base (fig. 14.5).\n\nThere is no record of treatment at the Art Institute.\n\nThe sculpture is in good condition. There are a few small spots of green corrosion on the legs.  \nSuzanne R. Schnepp\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Emily Crane Chadbourne (Mar. 4, 1871\u2013Dec. 23, 1964), Paris, London, Washington, DC, and Stone Ridge, NY, Oct. 1909\u2013Nov. 22, 1932.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Nov. 22, 1932.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Alfred H.

However, the sculpture was acquired by Emily Crane Chadbourne in early October 1909 and therefore must have been cast by that date; see Robert Gathorne-Hardy, ed., Ottoline: The Early Memoirs of Lady Ottoline Morrell (Faber &amp; Faber, 1963), pp. 183, 186, 189.\n\nClay must be kept damp to avoid cracking as it dries; Plasticine is formulated to be nondrying.\n\nWhen used to cast a plaster version of a sculpture, a mold is often destroyed when it is removed from the plaster; for this reason it is called a waste mold.\n\nModern sculpture alloys are usually actually alloys of copper, tin and zinc, with lead added to improve pouring.\n\nAnalyzed by Marcus L.
