    "description": "<p>After a decade in which he made virtually no drawings, Warhol suddenly began to draw again in late 1972. This extraordinary break in Warhol\u2019s studio practice immediately confronts us with two questions: why did Warhol stop drawing in 1962, and why did he start again ten years later? Editor of <em>The Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</em> Neil Printz will touch on both, with particular emphasis on the latter, Warhol\u2019s return to drawing in the 1970s.</p><p>Presented in association with the exhibition&nbsp;<a href=\"/exhibitions/2937/andy-warhol-from-a-to-b-and-back-again\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Andy Warhol\u2014From A to B and Back Again</em></a>, this lecture series will highlight various aspects of Warhol\u2019s production across the entirety of his career.</p><p>Presented by the Society for Contemporary Art</p>",
