    "description": "<p>Born in Brooklyn, Frederick William MacMonnies was one of the preeminent American sculptors of the late 19th century. Studying in New York, Munich, and Paris, MacMonnies lived most of his productive professional life in France. From his European studio, he executed public and private commissions for patrons in the U.S. With the assistance of architect Stanford White, MacMonnies earned the assignment for <em>Pan of Rohallion</em>, designed as a fountain figure for a garden pool on a private estate in New Jersey. The estate was called Rohallion in honor of a place of same name in the patron\u2019s native Scotland. MacMonnies\u2019s sculpture, with its classical theme and compositional clarity, held wide appeal and was later sold in reduced versions such as this example.</p>\n",
