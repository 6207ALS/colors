He made full use of the open pages, extending the reclining dancer\u2019s body across the horizontal support and up to its edges. Matisse drew directly with no preliminary sketch. Using a brush loaded with ink, he applied sweeping lines and short strokes of deep, fluid black. He continued to paint until his brush almost ran dry. Dry brushstrokes appear as fainter, broken lines that skip across the highpoints of the paper texture and define the right edge of the tutu and the upper contours of each extended leg. The wove sketchbook paper, manufactured by Arches with a repeating \u201cMBM\u201d watermark, has a bright, off-white hue, moderate texture, and gelatin sizing which facilitated drawing with brush and wash. There is a graphite line on the verso, which may have been the start of another sketch.\n\nThe long and narrow format of this sketchbook, which was originally marketed for plein air landscape studies, was known as \u201cforme longue \u00e0 l\u2019italienne\u201d and was defined as having a page width greater than the height of the spine. The sketchbook had a flexible spine that could lie flat. First bound and sold by stationers and bookbinders in the mid-nineteenth century, such blank books were later marketed directly to artists and sold by color merchants. A 1904 catalog of the Parisian color merchant Gustave Sennelier lists several sizes available in this format (see fig. 40.1). The largest measured 26 \u00d7 35 cm, close in scale to Matisse\u2019s sketchbook, which when closed measured approximately 28 \u00d7 38 cm.\n\nAt some point the sketchbook was unbound by cutting the binding threads and the drawing was removed. Sewing holes from the binding are evident along a vertical fold through the center of the sheet. Graphite notations in the upper corners on the verso, \u201cK 30\u201d and \u201cK 31\u201d (fig. 40.2 and fig. 40.3), may correspond to sketchbook pagination.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower center, in graphite) (fig. 40.4).\n\nMatisse drew using a brush and black ink. The resinous binder in the ink, possibly shellac, emits a yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light (254 nm). Microscope examination at 80\u00d7 confirms the medium is ink, not watercolor, as no discrete black pigment particles are apparent.\n\nThe support is moderately thick, moderately textured, off-white wove paper manufactured by Arches. There are identical watermarks in the lower right and left corners: MBM (1.8 \u00d7 19 cm) (see fig. 40.5). The paper has an even, bright color. The gelatin sizing allowed for working with wet brush and ink without ripples developing across the sheet. Transmitted-light examination shows an even fiber distribution, typical of machine-made paper. The bottom edge is a deckle edge. The right and left edges are imitation deckle edges, indicating that the paper is moldmade. The top edge is straight cut.\n\nThe support is a folio, or folded sheet, that was removed from a bound sketchbook as evidenced by six sewing holes located along the center fold. The sewing holes are spaced 3.3, 8.5, 11, 17, 19.2, and 24.5 cm from the top edge. Microscope examination at 80\u00d7 confirms ink extends over the top edge, indicating the sheet has not been cut down.\n\n27.7 \u00d7 75.6 cm (11 \u00d7 29 7/8 in.).\n\nThere is no record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. The vertical fold along the center has been reinforced on the verso (fig. 40.6) with a Japanese paper strip.  \nKristi Dahm\n\nThe drawing is in good condition with only gentle undulations across the sheet.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Family of the artist, to 1981.\n\nSold to Lumley Cazalet Limited, London, from 1981.\n\nB.C.
