With its sharp teeth and big, bulging eyes, it could be Hilarion, a personification of Science and the Devil. Gustave Flaubert, in his Temptation of Saint Anthony, described Hilarion as small and dwarflike, with a large head. The range of color and media seen in this folio is broad compared to that in the rest of the drawing. Touches of white and red watercolor and blue chalk were applied to heighten the primarily colored pencil composition, and some graphite lines were used to define the face in the upper center.\n\nOther characters in the scene are harder to identify: the wide-mouthed monster in a medieval helmet, for instance, or the hooded, horned man being consumed by red flames. On the right side of the image, a large hand belonging to the tonsured monk in sheet 8I grasps a labre fish (see fig. 1 and fig. 2), a reference to the newly canonized Saint Benedict Labre (see fig. 3 and fig. 4), whose name also appears on the sash worn by the top-hatted bourgeois man in folio 7C/D. The fish also relates to New Testament narratives about Christ\u2019s ministry, including the calling of fishermen to be apostles and the miraculous multiplication of fish and bread to feed his followers. The placement in the lower right corner and the monk\u2019s consumption of the fish link Labre\u2019s life of poverty in emulation of Christ\u2019s dedication to the poor to Saint Anthony\u2019s resistance to the worldly enticements of food promoted by the placards on the hats of the strutting figures to his right (see folios 7A/B and 8A/B).\n\nNotable for its broad lips, jutting jaw, and colorful scales, the labre has been called the perroquet de la mer (parrot of the sea). A large and diverse family of fish common to the North Sea near Belgium, the Netherlands, and France (as well as to the Mediterranean Sea, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, and subtropical climates), it was widely available at the Ostend fish market in Ensor\u2019s time. With more than six hundred species divided into nine subgroups, the labre was thoroughly described, categorized, and illustrated in several nineteenth-century scientific texts. Other figures in The Temptation have fish heads, notably the helmeted figure behind the hand holding the labre, whose large mouth resembles those of the lophotes fish as illustrated in Georges Cuvier\u2019s book The Class Pisces (Whittaker, 1832; see fig. 5). SMC/KJN\n\nEnsor not only painted many still lifes of fish but also signed his paintings with the pseudonym \u201cSmoked Herring.\u201d The pronunciation of the words for smoked herring in French\u2014hareng saur\u2014sounds like \u201cart Ensor.\u201d The painting Skeletons Fighting Over a Smoked Herring shows two skeletons (stand-ins for critics) quarreling over this symbol of Ensor\u2019s art (fig. 6). Similarly, the painting The Dangerous Cooks (fig. 7) depicts Octave Maus serving a fish dish to art critics, with the head of the artist labeled Art Ensor. Moreover, in Christianity fish are often associated with Jesus. Ensor tackled the subject of the multiplication of the fishes in 1891 (fig. 8). The fish also connects with the Old Testament story of Jonah and the whale, which Jesus used as a metaphor for resurrection (Matt. 12:38\u201345)\u2014a theme at the very core of Ensor\u2019s Temptation.
