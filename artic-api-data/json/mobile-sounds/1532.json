    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In the years since this arresting sculpture was first seen by the public, it's been described as both an idealized image of woman in general, and a sensuous portrait of one woman in particular, Isabelle Nagel. When Gaston Lachaise first met Nagel, he was a successful artist working and exhibiting in Paris. She was married and living in Boston. He followed her to America in 1906. Nagel eventually divorced her husband to marry Lachaise in 1917. The artist began preparing sketches and photos for Woman (Elevation) as early as 1912. Over the next four years, he produced models in clay and then plaster. The bronze you see here was made around 1928, and came to the Art Institute in 1943. It was originally owned by Nagel herself. In his own words, Lachaise depicted his wife as, &quot;Upstanding, noble, bountiful, poised on her toes, with closed, self-absorbed eyes, nearly detached from Earth.&quot;</p>\n",
