From 1946 to 1948 he studied with Norwegian-trained Kalo silversmith Daniel Hamer Pedersen, among the four longtime Kalo employees to whom founder Clara Barck Welles would turn over the business in 1959. From 1948 until 1967 Koehnemann worked independently, but at the Kalo studio.\n\nAs a student in the College of Fine Arts at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Koehnemann was introduced to the writings of British sculptor and Catholic convert Eric Gill. After graduation he undertook further studies in philosophy at DePaul University in Chicago, where he accepted Thomistic conceptions of beauty. He developed his own notion of the \u201cgenuine work of art,\u201d consisting of the following tenets: \u201c[The work] must be handmade; its designer must also be a craftsman, and each piece must be an original design.\u201d\n\nA devout Catholic, he was profoundly influenced by Pope Pius XII\u2019s 1947 address entitled \u201cThe Function of Art,\u201d a copy of which is found among Koehnemann\u2019s papers. In it the pope urged, \u201csteadfast perpetuation of the art-crafts, despite the awesome odds of industrial competition.\u201d Consonant with this idea, Koehnemann\u2019s work is, in his own words, \u201ccompletely handwrought. None of it is done by spinning, stamping, or casting, etc.: only highly polished hammers and stakes are used . . . This is real silversmithing in the true tradition.\u201d\n\nKoehnemann dedicated himself to the production of ecclesiastical objects, mainly chalices and patens, of which he made around 270 sets. These were typically gifts to priests commissioned by family members. Each chalice is different, and, as Koehnemann wrote, \u201call of my work is specially designed for the individual client and completely handwrought to order. There is no \u2018line\u2019 of chalices.\u201d However, all of Koehnemann\u2019s chalices conform to Church requirements: the bowl is to be of gold, or silver with gold plating, but other precious materials could be used in addition. He capitalized on the Church\u2019s view that \u201cit is for the artist to fashion [sacred vessels] . . . in a manner that is more particularly in keeping with the customs of each region, provided the individual vessels are suitable for their intended liturgical use and are clearly distinguishable from vessels intended for everyday use.\u201d\n\nA completely smooth finish would be possible at a client\u2019s request, but Koehnemann preferred creating a lightly hammered surface, which, together with the high quality of his work, recalls his Kalo training. Koehnemann\u2019s chalices often include ebony and semiprecious stones that he lathed himself (see fig. 98.1), but he was clear that their color must be naturally occurring; he refused to use so-called black onyx, because, as he noted, it \u201chas been developed mainly by dyeing inferior grey varieties of Chalcedony.\u201d\n\nFor the Art Institute\u2019s chalice, Koehnemann created a nearly hemispherical silver bowl with a gold-plated interior. The bowl is supported on a narrow, cylindrical silver stem engraved with the Sacred Heart and the pierced inscription LOVE ONE ANOTHER. The stem is interrupted by a wide cylinder that flows into a domed base. While the upper half of the cup could be mistaken for chalices from many different periods, the base, with its 1950s automobile fender\u2013like form in bright red enamel, is a reminder of Koehnemann\u2019s intention to render a ritual object of ancient origin in a manner befitting the period in which it was fabricated. This is consistent with his belief that \u201call great traditional art from the past was the \u2018modern\u2019 art of its day.\u201d  \nBarbara K.
