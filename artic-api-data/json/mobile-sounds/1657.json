    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This high-relief sandstone panel, created by anonymous sculptors in the 10th or 11th century, would have originally been seen on a temple wall.  It shows four-armed Shiva, one of the chief gods of the Hindu pantheon, with his consort Parvati.  Shiva, on the right, accepts the hand of Parvati, who stands at the far left of the panel.  They are enacting the key moment in a Hindu marriage ceremony, equivalent to the exchange of rings in a Western wedding.  When the bride places her right hand in the right hand of the groom, it's called &quot;accepting the hand.&quot; This is how Hindu couples have solemnized marital commitment for millennia.  The divine marriage of Shiva and Parvati, which represents the union of the male and female forces of nature, is considered the model of a happy Hindu marriage.  Their wedding ceremony was attended by all the gods.  The small figure in the center is Brahma, the creator, who officiates at the ceremony.  The small figure in the lower right is Vishnu, the preserver, who gives the bride away.  Like most of the objects in this gallery, this wedding relief comes from the extraordinary collection of James and Marilynn Alsdorf.  As a couple, they traveled together throughout Southeast Asia and collected works focused on the traditional arts of India, the Himalayas, and Southeast Asia.  The works they cherished, like this one, often depict customs that are very much alive today.</p>\n",
