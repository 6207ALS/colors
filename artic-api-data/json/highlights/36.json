    "copy": " Michelle Obama noted, \u201cWe think that all our country\u2019s great artists have a place within these walls.\u201d This tour highlights many of the artists whose works were on view at the White House during the Obama years and whose works are currently on view in the Art Institute galleries.   This highlights tour accompanies The Obama Portraits exhibition. All featured works are on view at the museum during the exhibition.   Alma Thomas\u2019s A Red Display of Fall Leaves (1972) On view in Gallery 297   The Obamas were the first White House residents to collect the work of an African American woman artist. Alma Thomas\u2019s Resurrection hung prominently in the Old Family Dining Room, and two more works by the artist were installed in the family\u2019s private living area. Thomas\u2019s signature style, known as the \u201cAlma Stripe\u201d\u2014short, rhythmic strokes of paint that appear almost like small tiles or mosaics\u2014can be seen in the artist\u2019s A Red Display of Fall Leaves , a painting that captures her fascination with color, light, and movement in the natural world. Thomas made the work in 1972, when she was 81\u2014the same year she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.   Ed Ruscha\u2019s City (1968) On view in Gallery 297   A large text-based canvas by Ed Ruscha was a prominent feature of the Obama White House. Titled \u201cI Think I\u2019ll . . . ,\u201d the painting features phrases like \u201cMaybe . . . Yes . . .\u201d and \u201cMaybe . . . No . . . \u201d and \u201cOn Second Thought\u201d on a streaky red and orange background\u2014 visual representations of the thinking process. Ruscha started as a sign painter and retained an interest in the tensions between text and image throughout his career. In the 1960s, he made canvases of single words\u2014chosen as much for the ideas they provoke as for how they sound\u2014and by the late \u201960s was executing them in a \u201cliquid\u201d or \u201cwet\u201d style, like the work City in the Art Institute\u2019s collection.   Glenn Ligon\u2019s Stranger in the Village #13 (1998) On view in Gallery 295   Glenn Ligon\u2019s Black Like Me #2 was displayed in the Obamas' living quarters. Ligon, who is known for his stenciled text paintings exploring authorship, history, and identity, created Black Like Me #2 in 1992 using a quote from the 1961 book Black Like Me, in which a white man recounts his experience traveling through the American South after artificially darkening his skin. The Art Institute work Stranger in the Village #13 is part of a series that Ligon began a few years later in which he rendered passages from James Baldwin\u2019s 1953 essay of the same title in nearly illegible black paint and coal dust. Allowing the words to degrade across the canvas, Ligon incorporated Baldwin\u2019s meditations on colonialism, race, and identity while addressing the limits of words to fully articulate experience.   Edward Hopper\u2019s Nighthawks (1942) On view in Gallery 262   Two landscapes by Edward Hopper kept President Obama company in the Oval Office. One of the president\u2019s favorite artists, Hopper often painted enigmatic scenes of lone figures in what were understood in the mid-20th century to be quintessentially American landscapes\u2014 movie theaters, diners, gas stations. His Nighthawks is among the most famous images of the era, an eerily lit painting of an all-night diner with three customers whose relationships are uncertain. While many have interpreted the work as a scene of modern disconnection, Hopper mostly avoided commenting on his intent but did share, \u201cunconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.\u201d   Jacob Lawrence\u2019s The Wedding (1948) On view in Gallery 262   While the Obamas brought many new modern and contemporary artworks into the White House, they also kept works that had been on display during previous administrations, including Jacob Lawrence\u2019s The Builders . Originally acquired in 2007 by Laura Bush, the painting depicts several workmen\u2014both Black and white\u2014 building a house together. Lawrence is best known for his Migration series: 60 panels that trace the journey of African Americans from the South to the North during the early 20th century. He also painted singular compositions like The Wedding . Here, a bride and groom along with their attendants stand before a minister. Positioning the figures with their backs to us, Lawrence invites viewers to participate in the couple\u2019s major life event.   Paul Cezanne\u2019s Auvers, Panoramic View (1873/75) On view in Gallery 248   In the 1920s, collector Charles Loeser gifted many Cezannes to the White House. They now all reside at the National Gallery of Art, except for a landscape, Sous-Bois , which hung in the Obamas\u2019 bedroom during their tenure. A French artist active at the same time as the Impressionists, Cezanne created a style that was very different than that famous group\u2014he used a darker palette and more emphatic brushwork, even sometimes using a palette knife to apply paint to his canvases. Throughout the early 1870s, he worked alongside the older Impressionist Camille Pissarro in Auvers, France, concentrating on landscapes, like this Art Institute work that makes a lively patchwork of the town\u2019s houses and rooftops.   Edgar Degas\u2019s Dancer Ready to Dance, Right Foot Forward (modeled 1882\u201395, cast 1919/21) On view in Gallery 226   Two bronze sculptures of dancers by Impressionist Edgar Degas\u2014 The Bow and Dancer Putting on Her Stocking \u2014decorated the Obama White House. Degas is well-loved for his depictions of dancers in a variety of media. Most of his bronzes, however, were cast after his death in 1917, when many models made of fragile materials like wax and clay were found in his studio. In order to preserve the compositions, the artist\u2019s heirs allowed the figures to be cast in bronze in limited editions. As Dancer Ready to Dance and the other sculptures in this case show, the bronze castings have preserved the figures for us and future generations to appreciate but have not dulled the dynamic sense of movement Degas captured in his figures.
