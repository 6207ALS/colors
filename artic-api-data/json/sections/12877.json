Recent scholarship has uncovered Feinauer\u2019s role in bringing modern design to the United States, exemplified in this three-piece coffee service epitomizing his unique blend of modernist forms for an American audience.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Feinauer began a youth apprenticeship program in the chasing, engraving, and design department of one of Germany\u2019s leading silver manufacturers, Peter Bruckmann and S\u00f6hne. Following his apprenticeship Feinauer stayed on with the firm through 1910, working as a freelance designer of sacramental silver. Extant examples of his work from these early years reflect his knowledge of, and affinity for, English arts and crafts. Feinauer\u2019s style grew increasingly simplified and geometric after collaborations with Henry Van de Velde, Georg Jensen, and the Deutscher Werkbund\u2014the latter giving him firsthand exposure to Bauhaus principles of pure geometry and rejection of excess ornament.\n\nIn 1925 Germany\u2019s harsh economic conditions spurred Feinauer to immigrate to the United States, where signs of a soaring consumer interest in contemporary goods were abundant and American silver production was on the rise. That year\u2019s Exposition Internationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris kindled American interest in avant-garde domestic design, and silver companies began to introduce lines responding to the new, modern taste. Indeed, as the New York Times reported in 1928, \u201cOne of the country\u2019s most important silver concerns . . . has been enterprisingly feeling out the popular demand for patterns that are strictly today\u2019s.\u201d While the writer was probably referring to Gorham Manufacturing Company and the way it drew modern-design inspiration from Europe, the International Silver Company did so as well, sending staff across the Atlantic to view and report on recent developments in decorative arts.\n\nInternational Silver was composed of a conglomerate of seventeen silver manufacturers, among them the Barbour Silver Company. Known as \u201cFactory A,\u201d Barbour produced some of the highest classes of silver sold by the large firm. In late 1928 or early 1929, Feinauer was hired to contribute to a hollowware series known as the Special Line. Comprising over fifty designs, the Special Line reflected European trends in modern decorative arts, marrying simplified forms and sleek, minimally adorned surfaces.\n\nWhile solidly indebted to the cylindrical and spherical forms produced by Bauhaus metalsmiths such as Johannes Itten and Christian Dell, the present coffee service, no. 5521, bespeaks Feinauer\u2019s fusion of various strains of modernism in his designs for the Special Line. Rather than adhering to the Bauhaus principle of eliminating extraneous ornament, Feinauer hand chased the neck of the coffeepot and cream pot with a delicate stepped pattern of right-angle lines, circles, and arcs. These motifs echo the early Cubist experiments of Pablo Picasso and others, who reduced their subjects to a series of fragmented shapes and discontinuous lines (see fig. 88.1). With its long neck and spherical body, the coffeepot reveals the influence of Middle Eastern sources; as company archives state, \u201cArabia gave us the idea for this charming black coffee service.\u201d These diverse sources come together to create an overall harmony: the intersecting lines and arcs that ascend the neck of the coffeepot and cream pot parallel the overall combination of straight and circular lines that make up the vessels; this is further echoed in the way the ball mounts meet the straight, elongated handle terminals. Even the addition of cane wrapping reinforces this pattern, as the straight edge of the rattan winds circuitously around each handle in the set.\n\nUnfortunately, Feinauer\u2019s designs for Barbour coincided with the devastating stock market crash of 1929, and International Silver was forced to close Factory A in March 1931. Feinauer remained in the United States, designing for Gorham and engaging with fellow European \u00e9migr\u00e9s, including Walter Gropius and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, until his death in 1955.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">On bottom of each piece (fig. 88.2)\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">With James P.
