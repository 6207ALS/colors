    "description": "<p>This collection contains documentation related to various historic properties and places in Illinois and Indiana that have been nominated to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Documented projects in this collection include both successful nominees as well as those ultimately not added to the NHRP. All but one item in this collection exists within Illinois; that remaining item from a border city in Indiana has been included due to its proximity to the state line. As with NRHP nominees in other states, the style, period, and type of sites documented here is greatly varied. Because many NRHP nomination forms are already readily available online, the scope of this collection has been limited to successfully nominated sites whose documentation is not currently available (as of late 2011), or unsuccessful nominations whose documentation may not be retained or disseminated by the IHPA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20Nomination%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
