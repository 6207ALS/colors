    "description": "<p>Commonly used in exit signs and traffic lights, LEDs have become increasingly popular among lighting designers due to their small size, energy efficiency, durability, and range of colors and effects. Merging the advantages of LED technology with a humanistic approach to design, Yves B\u00e9har and his San Francisco\u2013 based company fuseproject collaborated with Herman Miller to create an advanced task light that redefined LED capability. LED lamps usually become too hot to touch, but the Leaf\u2019s carefully engineered sculptural aluminum body acts as a heat dissipation system, making the lamp cool to the touch without the use of a fan. Moreover, the design\u2019s bendable arms and touch-sensitive controls allow the user to choose the light intensity and color according to functional need, mood, or location.</p>\n",
