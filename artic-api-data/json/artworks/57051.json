    "description": "<p>The painting of Classical ruins had reached the zenith of its popularity when Hubert Robert, the leading French practitioner of this specialty, was commissioned in 1787 to paint a suite of four canvases for a wealthy financier\u2019s ch\u00e2teau at M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, near Paris. <em>The Fountains</em> and its companion pieces were set into the paneled walls of a salon in the ch\u00e2teau, creating an alternate space that played off of the elegant, Neoclassical decor of the room. Robert has studied in Rome from 1754 to 1765 and there had gleaned his artistic vocabulary. Like the other three large paintings from the group painted for M\u00e9r\u00e9ville, all in the Art Institute, <em>The Fountains</em> exploits Robert\u2019s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space. The four paintings are inhabited by tiny figures in the foreground; these serve only to set the scale and animate the scene, for the ruins themselves are the true subject of the pictures. In his use of ruins, Robert embodied the notion of the relationship of mankind and the built environment to nature that was expressed by the French philosopher and encyclopedist Denis Diderot: \u201cEverything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.\u201d</p>\n",
