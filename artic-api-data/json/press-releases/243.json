    "copy": " Tuesday, February 13, 2018   CHICAGO\u2014 The Art Institute of Chicago announced today a collection-changing acquisition of Marcel Duchamp\u2019s boundary breaking readymade Bottle Rack (1914/59). Signed by Duchamp in 1960 for its owner\u2014a young Robert Rauschenberg\u2014this ever-provocative and still-astonishing work has a deep connection to two significant artists who radically challenged and redefined our notions of \u201cart\u201d and changed the course of art history. Acquired from the internationally respected Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, through Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac, Paris, Duchamp\u2019s Bottle Rack will go on view today, February 13, 2018, in the Art Institute\u2019s Gallery 395B, contextualized within the museum\u2019s exceptional galleries of modern art.   Art Institute President and Eloise W. Martin Director James Rondeau shared: \u201c Bottle Rack is among the most pivotal, landmark works in Marcel Duchamp's profoundly influential body of work. Rarely, do we have an opportunity to acquire an object that so succinctly embodies the expansive influence of an artist on future generations, including countless on display in our museum every day. This is a transformational moment for our world-class collection--with pride and gratitude we take another progressive step forward in a shared vision with our audiences, curators, and donors to create incomparable experiences of art and artists in our galleries in Chicago.\"   Duchamp\u2019s contributions are foundational to the history of modern art, and the history of modern art in Chicago. Taken out of its original context, reimagined, and signed by the artist, the readymade upended tradition and artistic convention\u2014transforming an everyday, ordinary object by virtue of the artist selecting it. In 1914, Duchamp purchased a common, mass-produced bottle rack at the French department store Bazar de l\u2019H\u00f4tel de Ville. Duchamp felt free to acquire new versions for exhibitions and display after his sister accidentally discarded the \u201coriginal.\u201d He selected the Art Institute\u2019s newly acquired version for the 1959 exhibition Art and the Found Object in New York . Robert Rauschenberg acquired Bottle Rack after the touring exhibition and later, in his studio in 1960, asked Duchamp to sign it; he obliged, writing in French, \u201cImpossible de me rappeler la phrase originale M.D./Marcel Duchamp/1960\u201d (Impossible for me to recall the original phrase M.D./Marcel Duchamp/1960).   Art Institute Deputy Director, Chair and Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art Ann Goldstein enthusiastically shared: \u201cDuchamp\u2019s readymade revolutionized the way we think about what an artwork is, how it is produced, and the ways in which it is exhibited\u2014over the course of the twentieth century, it opened up new worlds of art. This still radical work of modern art empowers us to expand, extend, and highlight some of the richest and most important stories in the history of art.\u201d   Bottle Rack deepens incredible moments of resonance and brings new storytelling power to the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection: from Duchamp\u2019s intertwined history with our progressive and visionary embrace of the Armory Show in our galleries in 1913, to Brancusi\u2019s Golden Bird (1919/20), which was included in the artist\u2019s landmark 1927 exhibition at the Arts Club of Chicago that was installed by Duchamp (and which entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection in 1990). In addition Brancusi\u2019s Leda (1923) also entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection through the support of Duchamp as a gift from Katherine S. Dreier\u2019s estate in 1953. Duchamp was a friend and advisor to our museum\u2019s first curator of modern art, Katharine Kuh, and he also played special role in the gift of the prestigious Mary Reynolds Collection of Surrealism in 1951.   Speaking on behalf of the Robert Rauschenberg Foundation, Senior Curator David White said, \u201cI am delighted that this groundbreaking work by Duchamp, which was one of Bob Rauschenberg\u2019s proudest possessions, has been acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago. Duchamp and his work hugely influenced Rauschenberg\u2019s thinking about art and the Bottle Rack will continue to provoke and enrich viewers as it joins the Institute\u2019s extraordinary collection.   The experience of Duchamp\u2019s Bottle Rack at the Art Institute of Chicago will encourage visitors to consider whether any other work of art occupies such an interesting and provocative position within, between, and at the forefront of so many pivotal moments in modern and contemporary art.
