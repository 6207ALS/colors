New Bauhaus/Institute of Design Interviews (Moholy-Nagy Foundation) [P] The Institute of Design (ID) began as an outpost of experimental Bauhaus education in Chicago and became one of the most important schools of photography in 20th-century America. In its iterations as the New Bauhaus (1937\u201338), School of Design in Chicago (1939\u20131944), and finally the Institute of Design (beginning in 1944), the school fostered exploration and innovation. Its faculty included such luminaries as L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy, Harry Callahan, and Aaron Siskind, who in turn attracted students who would become some of the nation's finest artists, designers, and photographers. The photographic work produced by teachers and students at the ID set new standards for picture-making, and the school\u2019s pedagogy has been disseminated internationally by generations of photographer-teachers. In preparation for the exhibition Taken by Design: Photographs from the Institute of Design, 1937\u20131971 (David Travis and Elizabeth Siegel, the Art Institute of Chicago, 2002), numerous telephone and in-person interviews were conducted with teachers and students from the school. These recollections provide insight into teaching methods, the unusual pedagogy of the school across its iterations, details of student life, and the camaraderie and mutual support felt by the students at this exciting place and time. The transcription of these interviews has been made possible by a generous grant from the Moholy-Nagy Foundation. Scholars may submit a request to hear audio recordings at rbarchives@artic.edu.
