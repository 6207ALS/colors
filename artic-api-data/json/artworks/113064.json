    "description": "<p>During Homer's sojourn in England from 1881 to 1882, he rented a studio on a cliff overlooking Cullercoats Harbor, where he observed the comings and goings of fishing boats. <em>The Return, Tynemouth</em> depicts two fishermen who have arrived on shore in early morning. Because this watercolor was painted with light-fast pigments, it retains the pale, orange-pink washes that have faded from many of the extant watercolors he painted with <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/glossary#fugitive\">fugitive red pigments</a>; for this reason, it offers a more complete idea of his developing powers in decorative color. Homer's study of the British Library's drawings by Michelangelo and Raphael during this 1881-82 trip to England may have improved his skill for rendering figures in motion, which are emphasized here by the artist's graphite underdrawing.</p>\n",
