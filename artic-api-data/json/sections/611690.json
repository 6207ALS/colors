Robinson, 1949.441\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent bubbly aquamarine glass. Blown in an open or two-part mold, tooled, and wheel-cut. The collared rim, rounded by reheating, is flared out and folded down and back up on itself to form a thick horizontal rim that spreads outward slightly from the top of the lip. The substantial rim sits on a very long and elegant cylindrical neck that swells slightly before being tooled and constricted above the body. The vessel expands into an ovoid form that tapers inward to a thickened, flattened bottom. The base is kicked, with what may be a slight pontil mark. Roughly evenly spaced from the greatest diameter to the base of the neck are four cut horizontal bands. The first, below the neck, is a wheel-abraded line; the second, third, and fourth are deeper, wider, wheel-cut grooves. The lower inward-tapering body is divided in half by another wheel-abraded line. All of the wheel-cut grooves have wheel-abraded lines above and below. For a zoomable image, see fig. 117.1.\n\nThe bottle is intact with some areas of heavy pitting and thick weathering crust. There is brown incrustation around the rim and upper neck with patches of the same along with iridescence on the body.\n\nGiven the elegant long neck of this vessel, the fact that it remained intact is extraordinary.\n\nClasina Isings notes a globular form with this type of rim but nothing of this piriform shape and wheel-cut decoration. A bottle with a long neck and a related but more squat body was formerly in the Bomford collection, Bristol. Two more examples are found in the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, and the Toledo Museum of Art, both with similar rims, shorter necks, and different body profile.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 90, form 70, which she considered rare and cited a first-century-A.D. example from Herculaneum and another from Cyprus dated to A.D. 220.\n\nBristol Museum and Art Gallery, Ancient Glass, p. 28, no. 108.\n\nHayes, Roman and Pre-Roman Glass, p. 58, fig. 4, pl. 11, no. 145, a more piriform body and the neck shorter than the body; Toledo Museum of Art, acc. no. 1923.1122.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 117 Bottle, 2nd/3rd century A.D.\n\nfig. 117.1 Bottle (2nd/3rd century A.D.).
