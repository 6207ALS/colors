In the fall of 1921, Matisse rented a spacious apartment at 1, place Charles-F\u00e9lix, in Nice that had two working rooms facing the Baie des Anges. As shown in photographs of his studio (see fig. 34.1), the artist used a wooden frame to suspend textiles that served as backdrops and arranged both artworks and objects that he collected during his travels and purchased from a merchant in Paris to create different sets. As he wrote to the American painter and critic Walter Pach in September 1921, \u201cIt seems to me as if I had never painted before. It\u2019s as if I have to start over from the beginning.\u201d Matisse continually renewed his investigations of light in each carefully staged scene by focusing his attention on balancing the treatment of figurative models and their surrounding bright, furnished interiors, as with Woman Reading at a Small Table (c. 1923; fig. 34.2). In the more intimate framing of Woman before an Aquarium, the light entering the darkened space of the scene unifies the still life arranged on the pink tabletop, the head of the seated figure, and the Moroccan haiti, or patterned textile, that serves as a backdrop. Matisse loosely sketched most of the composition before progressively building up layers of paint; however, he brushed in the pine branches and cones directly and with few changes. As with the similar composition of Young Woman before an Aquarium (end of 1921\u2013Feb. 1922; fig. 34.3), in Woman before an Aquarium Matisse placed the bright-green branches at a diagonal that traverses the depicted space. The artist accentuated the effect of sunlight with red and white brushstrokes on the left edge of the screen and bright highlights on the bowl and model\u2019s arms that draw the eye across the composition to the figure\u2019s partially illuminated face and the bright-aqua band separating the haiti panels.\n\nIn Woman before an Aquarium, Matisse revisited North African themes that he had investigated since traveling to Morocco in 1912 and 1913, such as his careful treatment of the ornate textile background to register variations of light in paint. Following his return from the country in 1913, the artist\u2019s memories of the \u201cmelting light\u201d and \u201cblazing brilliance\u201d of the landscape continued to inspire investigations of light; he captured its intensity through vibrant colors and ornamental patterns in works such as The Moroccan Caf\u00e9 (1913; fig. 34.4) and through the removal of material in five monotypes, including Fruits on a Moroccan Plate (1914\u201315; fig. 34.5). In his Nice period odalisques, Matisse reintroduced modeling and naturalism into his painterly investigations of costumed models and staged props bathed in direct sunlight in works such as Odalisque with Red Pants (fall 1921; fig. 34.6). In Woman before an Aquarium, however, the artist presented his model as a modern woman immersed in an illuminated decorative environment. Matisse used paint to study different types of light and shadow in the two panels of the Moroccan textile. On the left side, the artist first laid down a thin, gray wash over the white ground and painted the motif in dark purple covered by blue to give the softened effect of diffused light. He inverted his approach in the upper right panel, capturing bright reflections by using a brilliant-blue background, loosely brushing in the space around the design in olive, and filling in the lines with a darker gray. Below, the artist brightened the shadow of the chair with a dark-gray ground scraped thin before he painted purple lines, then retraced them in blue, and applied the olive around the pattern. Matisse layered and exposed his material process to record subtle variations of light and shadow across the composition.\n\nInspired by his travels, Matisse also revisited the then-exotic theme of goldfish in a bowl, using the vessel as an object of rumination that reflected and refracted light. In Matisse\u2019s early monumental works, including Interior with Goldfish (January\u2013mid-March 1914; Mus\u00e9e National d\u2019Art Moderne, Centre Pompidou, Paris), and Goldfish and Palette (late Nov. 1914\u2013spring 1915; fig. 34.7), he simplified and eliminated decorative and pictorial details to bring the focus to the goldfish bowls. As Matisse reintroduced the theme in the cool tones and modeled naturalism of Woman before an Aquarium, he more carefully examined the transformative effect of the sunlight entering a darkened space. By adding warm highlights to the orange fish, the figure\u2019s brown hair, and her partially lit face, the artist depicted the contemplation of light in the subject and making of this canvas.\n\nMatisse\u2019s dealer, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, sold Woman before an Aquarium to the Chicago collectors Frederick Clay and Helen Birch Bartlett in 1923. That same year, the work was exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, and it entered the collection in 1926.  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse painted Woman before an Aquarium with fluid, smooth paint on a nubby, standard-size no. 40 portrait (figure) linen canvas, pre-primed with a white ground. The composition is closely based on Young Woman before an Aquarium in the Barnes Foundation (end of Sept. 1921\u2013Feb. 1922; fig. 34.8). Matisse began with a loosely rendered, black painted sketch for most of the compositional elements; exceptions such as the arrangement of branches and pinecones were painted spontaneously and with little revision. The underlayers of the woman were worked up in shades of gray, and those of the blouse in pale blue and white. He later added warmer pink, orange, and violet tones and strong highlights to cast soft directional light on her.\n\nThe artist then made many adjustments, enhancing the lines and forms and emphasizing the diagonal thrust of the composition. He scraped off already dried paint and plotted changes with new sketch lines; that the paint had already dried suggests that the painting took some time to complete. A number of scraped areas are visible in the final composition. The woman\u2019s head was initially slightly smaller, and the eyes significantly lower. During the painting process the figure\u2019s arms were placed higher and the shoulders lowered; their contours, as well as those of the hair, were made more sinuous at a later point. The lower wrist and hand were not originally present.\n\nAlso during the painting process the goldfish bowl was raised and enlarged. The fish were changed from yellow to orange, and a fourth fish was added. The chair was raised and the corner to the left of the head added. The table was lengthened on the left side and shortened on the right. On the table, a few branches were painted out, and the paper was moved. Matisse created a sense of changing light and of space behind the perforated textile screen, creating a lively interchange between the different areas of the picture.\n\nMatisse restretched the painting after he painted and varnished it; as a result, 1\u20132 cm of the image was folded over the left edge and 0.3 cm over the top edge.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 34.9).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in dark-brown paint). The signature was applied on top of the varnish layer with a fine brush (fig. 34.10 and fig. 34.11).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions of the picture, both as originally stretched (81.4 \u00d7 101.5 cm) and as restretched by Matisse (81.2 \u00d7 100.2 cm), correspond to a standard-size no. 40 portrait canvas (81 \u00d7 100 cm). The stenciled text on the reverse, \u201c40.d\u00e9pos\u00e9 F,\u201d refers to the size and format. This is one of Matisse\u2019s larger paintings of 1921\u201323.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 15.7V (0.5) \u00d7 24.5H (0.5) threads/cm (fig. 34.12). The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas has many protruding nubs and fibers, adding texture to the thinly painted surface (fig. 34.13 and fig. 34.14). The selvage may have been along the bottom edge: although the actual bound edge (where the weft thread changes direction) has been cut. The current bottom tacking margin of 4 cm has no ground, while the other three tacking margins were cut through the ground. There is strong primary cusping along the bottom edge that extends through to the top from the ground application, and slight secondary cusping on the sides from Matisse\u2019s stretching of the canvas onto the stretcher.\n\nCurrent stretching: After Matisse varnished the painting, he restretched the canvas, folding the paint on the left side and the top slightly over the stretcher edge. He first marked the intended new left edge with a line of black paint. The new stretching was not quite square to its previous orientation, so the foldover along the left edge is 1 cm near the bottom and 2 cm near the top (fig. 34.15). When he reduced the size of the stretcher in order to do this, it became less off-square than it had been originally. The unpainted tacking margin on the opposite (right) side now shows, particularly near the top. At the same time, he folded over 0.3 cm of paint along the top edge, especially toward the left, and pulled a small section of the unprimed bottom tacking edge onto the front (fig. 34.16 and fig. 34.17). The canvas has remained as Matisse himself restretched it at this time.\n\nOriginal stretching: The composition originally extended an additional 1\u20132 cm to the left, with an enlarged area of the nondescript brown background. It was originally stretched slightly off square.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher is likely original to the painting. Rough wood with knots and bevels on recto and verso. It consists of half-lap mortise and tenon joints with keys and two crossbars (fig. 34.18). Dimensions: stretcher-bar width, 5.3 cm; depth, 1.3 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nThere is a stencil on the reverse of the stretcher, \u201c40.d\u00e9pos\u00e9 F\u201d, centered on the bottom stretcher member, that indicates a standard-size no. 40 portrait (figure) canvas (fig. 34.19). There is no color merchant stamp.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nPre-primed. The white ground is mostly covered by paint on the front. It is visible at the edge of the woman\u2019s face and underneath thinner washes, such as the pine boughs (fig. 34.20). The ground underneath these thin washes appears very bumpy; such a disruption of the ground may have been caused by adding paint thinner (turpentine or turpentine and paint medium) to the washes.The edge of the ground on the bottom (presumed selvage edge) is aligned with the bottom front edge of the composition.\n\nCross-sectional analysis indicates that there is one layer of ground, ranging from 40 to 100 \u03bcm in thickness (fig. 34.21).\n\nCool white. The ground layer contains a significant amount of blue particles visible in the cross section that would lend the white a slightly cooler tonality (fig. 34.22).\n\nFTIR analysis indicates that the ground contains lead white (basic lead carbonate) in an oil binder. SEM/EDX determined that the ground is a mixture of mostly lead white with minor amounts of barium sulfate (barite), zinc white, ultramarine blue, and a trace amount of of calcium-based white.\n\nThe paint surface is generally opaque and almost completely covers the preliminary sketch. Transmitted-infrared reflectography reveals painted sketch outlines for the figure and other major elements (fig. 34.23). The initial painted sketch and adjustments are most discernible when viewed under infrared light (see under Revisions). In one spot, the sketch can be seen with the naked eye as a horizontal black line, directly on the ground, in the stem of the goldfish bowl, where it outlined the previous bottom edge of the bowl (fig. 34.24).\n\nThere are probably some charcoal or graphite lines, although they are difficult to distinguish from overlying paint strokes (fig. 34.25). Where Matisse added the backdrop pattern as a revision over an already painted area, he may have drawn it first on top of the paint (fig. 34.26).This can be seen just to the left of the chair, where a darker purple was added after the adjacent screen was painted. Matisse then drew thin lines over the purple, outlining the edges of each blue brushstroke he would paint.\n\nPainted sketch lines are most likely black oil paint, as seen in the small bit revealed in the stem of the goldfish bowl. These lines are painted directly on the ground.\n\nApparent charcoal or graphite lines are visible in a few spots only and were not analyzed.\n\nThe composition of Woman before an Aquarium is based on the smaller oil painting Young Woman before an Aquarium in the Barnes Foundation (fig. 34.8) in all aspects except the background. Matisse made many adjustments during the painting of the Chicago picture, which reveal that, in its early stages, the composition was even closer to the Barnes version.\n\nMatisse made most changes during the painting stage rather than in the initial sketch stage, but he sometimes painted new sketch lines to first outline these changes. Such revised sketch lines were used to lift and enlarge the goldfish bowl and change the perspective of the water level by narrowing its oval surface. These lines are visible in normal light, while the sketch for the earlier smaller fishbowl is more visible in reflected infrared (1.0\u20131.1 \u03bcm) (fig. 34.27). Often, he would scrape away paint as well as the original painted sketch line. This is the case for the lower edge of the right arm, which was scraped away and raised, though remnants of the initial black sketch line can still be seen with the naked eye (fig. 34.28).\n\nThe figure\u2019s face was also much reworked with painted sketch lines. The eyes were significantly lower at first. Matisse experimented with several nose positions and profiles at the left edge, and a smaller mouth, visible in a combination of the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images (fig. 34.29). An earlier sketch line for the right side of the outline of the hair is evident where it swept farther down across the cheek, intersecting the corner of the earlier eye. At one point, a sketch line delineated a straighter line for the hair at the temple. Both of these earlier contours for the hair are visible in transmitted infrared, which also shows how the hair at the back of the neck was moved to the right, and then narrowed back toward the left again.\n\nThere are four sketch lines for the figure\u2019s left shoulder, which seem to work their way down from a larger, rounded form to the final, more curvaceous one. The neckline at the shoulder also changed, as seen in reflected infrared (1.0\u20131.1 \u03bcm) (fig. 34.30). There also appears to be an earlier, scraped sketch line for a high right shoulder, visible in reflected infrared (1.1\u20131.4 \u03bcm), that would be closer to the Barnes painting. Lower, less curvaceous shoulder lines are visible in transmitted infrared (fig. 34.31). The neckline of the blouse had varied positions, both higher and lower on the figure\u2019s left shoulder. There are also various lines sketched for the left side of the table, as Matisse expanded it progressively farther out. On the right side, the table was made less oblique by extending the back corner and moving the front corner inward (fig. 34.32). For this change, Matisse scraped off the screen pattern and sketch line for the earlier table before repainting the new angle\n\nThe arrangement of pine boughs was painted thinly and directly over a pale-green underlayer. Matisse eliminated some branches below the pinecones and fishbowl in the three areas where the table is now denser and more pink, and enlarged some cones. Just to the left of the long front branch, the calligraphic strokes of a different branch with fronds can be discerned in transmitted infrared (fig. 34.33). The revised angle of this branch is parallel to the painting\u2019s diagonals as set by the other pine fronds, the figure\u2019s arms, the page on the table, and the diagonals in the fabric screen behind, while the previous branch curved over the table edge.\n\nIn Woman before an Aquarium, the consistency of the paint runs the gamut from fluid washes to thin, translucent and thicker, opaque applications, often built up in layers to introduce changes. Glimpses of the lower layers suggest many areas began as thin washes, as is still visible in the branches and the thin wash background of the left half of the screen (fig. 34.34). The woman was worked up monochromatically, with shades of gray in the underlayers, and shades of blue-gray and white for the blouse; the tan of the figure\u2019s skin and pink of the blouse were added later (fig. 34.35). The fabric hanging on the left side of the screen was also initially monochromatic, and the red and pink layers were added later (fig. 34.36). The table was laid in with reddish brown and subsequently covered with pink. The goldfish bowl was first painted in shades of gray and only later reworked with pale blue. The fish were initially yellow, with orange accents added wet-in-wet with brown shading (fig. 34.37). Originally there were only three fish, all facing the figure. Matisse added the left, outward-facing fish later over the gray of the bowl.\n\nOther changes made during the painting stage, include adding a right wrist and hand to the figure\u2019s arm where none had existed, later to be scraped away or wiped and positioned higher (fig. 34.38). Matisse raised the top of the chair and scraped an area to the left of the figure\u2019s hair, where he added the chair\u2019s left corner (fig. 34.39). He brought forward the paper lying on the table; he may have made this early change by wiping away the earlier form when it was still wet, judging from its lack of density in the X-ray and the fact that the pink of the table was painted after the second paper had been added (fig. 34.40). After adjustments, Matisse gave each element a fuller shape, including the arms and hair, and he reinforced the contours late in the process with dynamic, curving, confident lines, as on the shoulders and arms (fig. 34.41). The spaces between the forms on the table were also given a strong presence, so that forms and spaces interlock in a clear, unified structure, its tight construction emphasized by the large empty spaces around it.\n\nMatisse focused much of his attention during the painting process on augmenting the sense of light on the screen and on the figure. Although the screen blocks off the space behind the woman, Matisse varied his technique to create the impression that light penetrates the screen from both back to front and front to back in different sections. His subtle handling animates the repeating geometric pattern of the screen.\n\nThe left side of the screen was painted to suggest that it is backlit by a diffuse, gray luminosity (fig. 34.42). Matisse first spread a translucent, purple-blue-gray wash across the whole area, so thinly that the bright-white ground reflects through it. Matisse then painted the screen design with dark-purple-gray lines, creating a monochrome effect (fig. 34.43). He added blue-green lines that seem opaque to the dim light, but he left edges of the dark-purple lines exposed, so they function almost like shadows at the edges of the cut fabric and give a more material presence to the design.\n\nThe upper right side of the screen presents the reverse effect\u2014the screen catches the light from the front and the background appears dark. The tones are of almost equal value, so the pattern itself is subdued (fig. 34.44). Here, Matisse first painted the background with an overall layer of bright blue (fig. 34.45). Using dark olive-brown over the bright blue, he next painted the negative spaces that would remain between the pattern of the screen. Without first sketching in the pattern, he held the screen design in rather rough, bright-blue reserve\u2014a more awkward, indirect approach. Then, within the irregular bright-blue reserves that remained, he painted the screen pattern with dark-blue-gray lines. Because the initially laid-in negative spaces were inexact, when the lines for the geometric pattern were later added between them, random areas of the lower, bright-blue layer were left uncovered. These bright-blue patches give the impression of bright light reflecting off the edges of the screen design and animate the otherwise subdued pattern in a lively, random manner.\n\nBelow this, the screen to the right of the chair and table was created by yet a third method. Originally it was painted dark gray, possibly intended as a shadowy area resembling that on the opposite side of the screen above the table. Matisse then vigorously scraped the dark gray, leaving a residue that imitates the thin wash used for the left half of the screen, and transformed this area into an illuminated space (fig. 34.46). As on the left, Matisse added the geometric pattern with purple-gray lines, later covered with blue-green lines. The circles do not align properly with those of the rows above\u2014they are smaller, squeezed in to fit the confines of the smaller space. He then added the pattern of negative space with the same olive-brown as above, but since it is painted over a more reflective ground rather than over opaque blue, and is more thinly painted, the effect is lighter in tone. Matisse thus changed this area from one of shadow to one of animated pattern and light, but it is still consistent with the colors above it.\n\nThe various methods Matisse used for the background screen create a lively interchange between the different areas of the painting and the perception of light and space within the limited confines of the flat pattern (see fig. 34.41). The screen developed slowly, as he worked on other parts of the painting. The left side of the screen remained gray with purple gray lines while Matisse enlarged the goldfish bowl and added the left side of the chair. The right side remained bright blue without a pattern while Matisse widened and then reduced the top of the head and raised the back of the chair.\n\nIn the later stages of the painting process, Matisse also introduced a stronger light on the figure, creating the impression that there is a window outside the frame on the left-hand side. Matisse likely proceeded from the initial grayish modeling to richer oranges and tans and finally added the strong highlights that fall obliquely from the left onto the model\u2019s face and illuminate the top edges and curves of her arms. The shoulder on the left, as well as the left side of the chair, had originally been shaded with dark tones. These dark layers were scraped off and repainted with bright highlights (fig. 34.47). Matisse overlaid the white/blue-gray blouse with touches of pink, including pink reflected light from the table, while adding additional pale highlights and darker lavender and brown shadows, and he shaded the pink and tan table with violet. These added touches of color, along with the oblique angle of light, suggest the end of the day.\n\nDuring the painting process, Matisse adjusted and reworked the forms, sometimes by simply painting over earlier layers, sometimes by wiping away still-wet paint, probably with a cloth, or still-soft paint, probably with turpentine, or alternately, by scraping off paint that had already hardened with a knife (fig. 34.48 and fig. 34.49). In the neck of the goldfish bowl the paint appears gently wiped, rather than scraped, to increase its translucency (fig. 34.50). Areas of scraping with a knife include the left side of the hair and chair back, the eye on the left, the front edge of the hair and the jaw on the right, the chin, the shoulder on the left, the dress edge over the shoulder on the right, the lower edge of the arm on the right, both front and back corners of the right side of the table, and the area of the screen to the right of the chair and table (fig. 34.51). Matisse also lightly scraped the right edge of the fishbowl, but here it was done to suggest the bright effect of light (fig. 34.52). During scraping, the dried paint chipped off in little pieces that sometimes stuck in other still-wet passages of paint (fig. 34.53). That the paint had hardened sufficiently to chip indicates that the painting took some time to complete. Matisse allowed much of his scraping to remain visible (for example, in the chair to the left of the hair), and when he did overpaint, he often made little effort to match the surrounding color or brushwork closely, as at the lower left corner (fig. 34.54). And at the front right corner of the table, where it was moved inward, he did not feel it necessary to extend the screen pattern over the gray he had painted over the table\u2019s previous position. To mark the new horizontal line of the table, which had previously slanted down toward the left, Matisse scratched a line through the dry paint (probably with the knife), exposing the ground, and then he only partially painted over it. The line still shows at the right side (fig. 34.55).\n\nMatisse used brushes of various sizes. He used a knife for scraping and a cloth for wiping. He used a sharp tool, perhaps the knife, or possibly a brush handle or needle, to make a scratch for the table edge.\n\nSEM/EDX analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, a small amount of zinc white, cobalt violet (cobalt phosphate type), bone black, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, a chromium-based pigment\u2014either chrome yellow and/or viridian (or possibly barium chromate), iron oxide, barium sulfate, and a calcium-based white.\n\nThe overall tone is cool, and the blue of the screen predominates, with a vivid green screen frame directly above the model\u2019s head. These cool colors are balanced by the large area of subdued browns and pinks. Even the figure\u2019s lips are brown rather than red. The colors are generally subdued, but with the purple of the screen and yellow and orange fish, all primary and secondary colors are represented. In the early stages, the figure\u2019s skin tones were laid in with grayer hues, and the blouse with blue-gray and white. The fishbowl was initially gray without the blue highlights. With the initial grayish screen layers on the left, the effect would have been more monochromatic on the left side. But the table was initially orange-brown and the color of the screen on the right was initially bright blue, so the lower and right side would have been brighter in the early stages.\n\nProbably oil. The paint is generally fluid, flowing over the nubby canvas, with little brushwork texture or impasto. Matisse used dilute washes for the background of the left screen and for the pine needles (fig. 34.56). Additional paint medium was probably added to the paint to make it more fluid yet still dense. More wash-like layers were probably thinned with turpentine.\n\nThe paint in the face has a wrinkled texture. This appears to have occurred in a lower layer, probably rich in medium, that had not dried completely when it was painted over (fig. 34.57).\n\nThere are numerous inclusions of tiny paint chips in the paint\u2014remnants from scraped areas. These inclusions and the very nubby texture of the canvas supply some random surface texture.\n\nThere is a thin varnish layer over the entire painting, which fluoresces a faint blue-green under ultraviolet light, and the surface is almost uniformly glossy (fig. 34.58). There are also many fibers trapped on the surface, apparently in this coating. FTIR analysis identified the varnish as a mixture of oil and natural resin. Tiny spot tests indicated that it is relatively insoluble. It is not noticeably discolored.\n\nMatisse applied this thin varnish coating over the surface, which would tend to saturate the darker colors differentially, increasing the contrast between light and dark and making the scraped areas less anomalous. This varnish extends over the painted strip folded over the left edge, indicating that the picture was varnished first and then, as a final step, restretched. The artist signed the work over the varnish, evidence that he applied the varnish himself.\n\nThe painting entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection only a few years after it was painted and was unlikely to have received conservation treatment before then. There is no record of any treatment at the museum until 1997, when the surface grime was removed aqueously. The signature, which is on top of the varnish, blanched slightly and was resaturated with a very thin coating of Acryloid B-72.\n\nThe work is in a pristine state, unlined and still as restretched and varnished by Matisse. The relatively insoluble varnish, which probably has an oil component, does not appear discolored. There are some small tears on the tacking edges, particularly at the bottom left corner. The bottom tacking margin, which has no ground, is particularly weak. There are slight abrasions from the frame around the edges. There is a slight bulge in the bottom left corner.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a twenty-first-century, American, L-shaped, molding frame. The frame has a red-brown-black-stained and varnished finish over a cherrywood molding. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is straight outer side and fillet face (fig. 34.59).\n\nPrevious frame (removed 2009): The work was previously housed in a twentieth-century, American (New York), R\u00e9gence, ogee frame with straight sides and anthemia-corner and flower-centered rosettes with a cartouche at center, and plain reposes and an independent linen-covered liner. The frame has red-orange-bole water gilding over gesso. The surface has been heavily distressed, with the gilding and bole mostly removed on the reposes and toned overall with washes of raw umber and white. The carved basswood moldings were mitered and nailed and glued to a butt-jointed chestnut back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was straight outside; ovolo with running ovate; scotia side; fillet; torus with reed and leaf; fillet; ogee face with anthemion-and-foliate-corner and flower-centered rosettes and foliate center cartouches, both on punched diamond beds and plain repose; fillet; sanded frieze; fillet; ovolo with foliate bracketed bellflower at the sight edge, with an independent linen-covered liner (fig. 34.60 and fig. 34.61).\n\nPrevious frame: The work was previously housed in an American, plain white-painted molding frame.

Matisse traveled to Algeria in May 1906 and spent significant time in Morocco during two trips between January 1912 and February 1913. See Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cWoman before an Aquarium,\u201d Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 33, no. 1 (2007), p. 75. On the significance of Matisse\u2019s travels to Morocco, see National Gallery of Art, Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912\u20131913 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, 1990).\n\nIn 1912 Henri Matisse wrote to the painter Henri Manguin from Tangiers, \u201cWhat melting light, quite different from the C\u00f4te d\u2019Azure . . . The vegetation has all the blazing brilliance of Normandy and such decorative force!!! How new everything seems, too, and how difficult to do with nothing but blue, red, yellow and green.\u201d Matisse to Manguin, Mar. 1, 1912, as translated in Spurling, Matisse the Master, p. 104. For more information on The Moroccan Caf\u00e9 (1913; fig. 6) and his monotypes, see John Elderfield, \u201cThe Moroccans, first state\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 134\u201337; and D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cSurface and Depth,\u201d in Matisse: In Search of True Painting, ed. Dorthe Aagesen and Rebecca Rabinow (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2012), pp. 95\u2013100.\n\nOn these early works, see Elderfield, \u201cInterior with Goldfish\u201d and \u201cGoldfish and Palette,\u201d both in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 196\u201399, 240\u201343. Matisse returned to the theme of the goldfish in 1923, the same year that the French designer and collector Jacques Doucet bought Goldfish and Palette (late November 1914\u2013spring 1915; fig. 7), which he paired with Pablo Picasso\u2019s famous canvas Les demoiselles d\u2019Avignon (1907). See Spurling, Matisse the Master, p. 256.\n\nMany scholars read this as a somber painting due to the cool tones. For example, Catherine Bock-Weiss describes the \u201cintrospective and shrewd\u201d character of the work in Bock-Weiss, Henri Matisse: Modernist against the Grain (Pennsylvania State University Press, 2009), pp. 83\u201384.\n\nDauberville and Dauberville, Matisse, p. 1064.\n\nGroup of Modern Paintings from the Birch-Bartlett Collection, the Art Institute of Chicago, Sept. 8\u2013Oct. 22, 1923.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image.

There is no evidence of a sizing layer under ultraviolet light; however, the presence of a sizing layer is often difficult to determine from cross sections.\n\nSee footnote 17 below for proof that Matisse himself restretched the canvas.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see D. H. Johnson and R. G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report, Woman Before an Aquarium,\u201d Jan. 2015.\n\nThe black line painted to indicate the new edge appears to be under the varnish. Matisse\u2019s signature is over the varnish, so we know that the restretching line and varnish were applied by Matisse. It follows that he himself restretched the canvas along this line.\n\nWhen the keys are first knocked into place, a stretcher often becomes slightly enlarged. Matisse could have removed the keys and hammered in the sides, so the stretcher was as narrow as possible, and then restretched the canvas more tautly in the horizontal direction, in order to fold over the 1\u20132 cm without having to replace the horizontal stretcher bars with shorter ones.\n\nThe stretcher is still slightly off square, with the top listing slightly to the left, but was more off-square when Matisse first painted the composition, with the top 1 cm wider than at the bottom. If he had brought the stretcher closer to square, even more of the left side at the top would have needed to be folded over. Matisse might have shifted the canvas upward to ensure that the short section of black and white skirt showing below the table was less likely to be covered by a frame.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is often difficult to determine from cross sections. The possible absence of sizing might account for the particularly nubby surface texture.\n\nIt is not known whether Matisse used commercially primed canvas or pre-primed canvas himself.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926.220\\_Matisse\\_Aquarium\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using (FTIR); see Gwena\u00eblle Gautier, \u201cMatisse\\_FTIR results summary\\_2011, dated June 13, 2011. SEM/EDX analysis was conducted by Inge Fiedler; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_220\\_Matisse\\_Aquarium\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2017; both reports on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFor example, even the slight slant of the front table edge that is seen in the Barnes picture was originally copied in the Chicago picture, but was later repainted as a true horizontal. The right edge of the table, like that of the Barnes, was more sharply angled back. Similarly, in the figure, the hair was higher at the top of the head and fuller on the far side; the eyes were lower in the face and the lips were smaller. A shadow on the foreshortened elbow originally matched that of the Barnes, but the added highlight obscures this. The neckline of the dress was initially higher, as in the Barnes. Matisse had painted a second tuck in the chair, but later eliminated it. The fishbowl was initially gray, with three yellow fish, but was repainted with light blue. Orange accents were added to the original fish, and a fourth fish was added.\n\nBecause these areas are shaded from transmitted light by the stretcher crossbars, the forms are more distinguishable when the density of the crossbars has been digitally reduced.\n\nThe earlier curved branch hanging over the table edge is found in the Barnes painting.\n\nThese earlier aspects\u2014the gray fishbowl and three yellow fish\u2014are found in the Barnes painting.\n\nThis piece of chair to the left of the figure was suggested as an afterthought in the Barnes painting, by an added sketch line.\n\nAlthough the forms of the still life are the same as painted in the earlier Barnes version, there were no interspersed empty spaces there, which were filled with more generous pine fronds, while the figure, chair, and fishbowl were more constricted.\n\nMatisse had a carpenter construct a folding frame for the blue cut fabric textile panels. A photo, taken by Man Ray at this time, shows Matisse painting his model, Henrietta, posed in front of the same blue screen and wearing the same black and white striped skirt as in the Chicago picture. (Apparently he is painting the Bern Kunstmuseum Girl Reading from 1923.) The actual pattern of the cutwork is more elaborate, but in the Chicago painting Matisse has translated it into a simpler geometric pattern. The vertical pattern in the fabric adjacent to the frame is present in the actual fabric. In other paintings Matisse elaborated the screen\u2019s pattern, but in the Pompidou Odalisque of 1921, he simplified it into a geometric pattern very similar to that in the Chicago picture. Like the Chicago picture, it also has a striated vertical band (a piece of fabric?) apparently hanging off the left edge of the screen.\n\nBefore these highlights were added, the lighting had been close to the Barnes picture, and more diffuse in nature. Matisse may have had the model, who still worked for him in 1923, resume the earlier pose in order to render the new highlights so convincingly.\n\nAccording to a questionnaire that Matisse filled out for the Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1950, he usually, but not always, would wipe away with solvent the components that he wished to change. Questionnaire II from Alfred Barr, Mar. 1950, Archives of the Museum of Modern Art, p. 188; cited in John Elderfield, Matisse in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art, exh. cat. (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1978).\n\nThe earlier, more oblique edge created a strong diagonal that was at odds with the primary crossed diagonals of the composition.\n\nThe analysis is based on limited sampling and does not include all pigments present in the painting. Analysis conducted by Aniko Bezur and Inge Fiedler. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926.220\\_Matisse\\_Aquarium\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis is perhaps the largest change from the Barnes version, which is painted in warm tones, with red predominating.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Matisse\u2019s technique.\n\nThe small wrinkles generally run perpendicular to the visible brushwork, as though the semidry layer below had been pushed into ridges by the brush when strokes were applied on top of it.\n\nSee FTIR results summaries by Gwen Gautier, Sept. 7, 2007, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOther varnishes applied by Matisse exhibited the same insolubility. The other Matisse paintings in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago that appear to have artist-applied overall varnishes are Apples (1916; cat. 24), Woman on a Rose Divan (1921; cat. 33), Lemons on a Pewter Plate (1926; cat. 39), and Girl in Yellow and Blue with a Guitar (1939; cat. 46). Paintings that likely have artist-applied partial varnishes are Laurette with Cup of Coffee (1916/17; cat. 26) and Daisies (1939; cat. 47).\n\nThe fact that the signature is over the varnish suggests that the varnish was not meant to be removed, since this would disturb the signature.\n\nSee Kristin Lister, treatment report, Aug. 30, 1997, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute Chicago.\n\nThe reframing was part of a campaign corresponding with the opening of the Renzo Piano\u2013designed Modern Wing addition to the Art Institute in 2009.\n\nThe duration of this approach to framing the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection is unknown; however, by time of the Century of Progress exhibition in 1933 (see Exhibition History), all the works appear to have been reframed.\n\nGuy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Matisse: Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune, vol. 2 (\u00c9ditions Bernheim-Jeune, 1995), p. 1064.\n\nGuy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Matisse: Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune, vol. 2 (\u00c9ditions Bernheim-Jeune, 1995), p. 1064; and Board of Trustees meeting minutes, Jan. 27, 1926, pp. I\u2013II; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBoard of Trustees meeting minutes, Jan. 27, 1926, pp. I\u2013II; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDates per Museum Registration Department Artists Sheet (Y-sheet); photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.
