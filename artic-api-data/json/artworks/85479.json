They wear large crescent headdresses and hold staffs; they also are shown with prominent noses and distinctive ear ornaments. The combination of these features and regalia is characteristic of the &quot;Sic\u00e1n Lord,&quot; a figure believed to represent the humanized version of Naymlap, a legendary ancestral lord in the Lambayeque region who was said to have evaded death by growing wings and flying away. The sides and bottom borders of this panel are filled with round motifs\u2014rendered using a variety of color combinations\u2014that may represent bundles of gathered cotton or cotton bolls.</p>\n",
