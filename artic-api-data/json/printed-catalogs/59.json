    "copy": " This magisterial volume, the result of many years of research, documents the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s significant\u2013\u2013and, surprisingly, relatively unknown\u2013\u2013collection of English, French, German, Netherlandish, and Spanish paintings created before 1600. Nearly 100 altarpieces, private devotional works, portraits, and landscapes by such masters as Lucas Cranach, Gerard David, El Greco, Jan Gossaert, and Rogier van der Weyden receive their first in-depth analysis.   With its accessible entries and beautiful illustrations, this publication reflects the most up-to-date scholarship. New conservation investigations, including the study of under-drawing and of wood supports, illuminate many issues surrounding these paintings.
