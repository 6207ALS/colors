He undertook these other works, however, not to explore alternatives for the composition but to refine and solidify the forms he had already identified. Made during the process of painting, these related works served the artist as exercises to confirm and clarify his means. Such is the case with Bathers with a Turtle (Dec. 1907\u20131908; fig. 14\u201315.1), which generated numerous sculptures and drawings, including the Art Institute\u2019s Small Crouching Nude without an Arm and Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back.\n\nLate in 1907, Matisse began the large-scale Bathers with a Turtle, a work that would mark a fresh direction in which the artist drew upon his practice of repeating motifs in numerous paintings and sculptures, and forged a new approach predicated on an exceptional degree of reworking, now on the same canvas. Matisse first painted the group seen in Bathers with a Turtle in the smaller Three Bathers (fig. 14\u201315.2), initially titled Le bain, which he made before a trip to Italy in the summer of 1907. He reprised and synthesized it for Le luxe (I) (summer 1907; fig. 14\u201315.3) and Le luxe (II) (summer\u2013fall 1907; fig. 14\u201315.4), produced after his return. In these works, the artist employed the same three figures seen in Bathers with Turtle, repeating their standing, crouching, and sitting (or striding) poses with small variations even as he moved the overall composition toward greater simplification.\n\nMatisse\u2019s repetitive practice served his goal of paring his forms down to their purest, most meaningful state, or what he called their \u201ctruer, more essential character.\u201d This way of working extended beyond his own creations; he also consistently revisited poses and subjects that he gleaned from mass-produced photographs of models in publications such as L\u2019\u00e9tudes acad\u00e9mique and Mes modeles as well as from paintings by a diverse range of artists, including, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Giorgione, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, and Titian. By repeatedly reusing these artistic resources, Matisse sought to mine\u2014or rather, drain\u2014forms of specific meaning to achieve a greater, more universal vocabulary of expression. \u201cWhen I see the Giotto frescoes at Padua,\u201d he wrote in \u201cNotes d\u2019un peintre\u201d about the great work he had seen in the summer of 1907, \u201cI do not trouble myself to recognize which scene of the life of Christ I have before me, but I immediately understand the feeling that emerges from it, for it is in the lines, the composition, the color. The title will only serve to confirm my impression.\u201d\n\nSmall Crouching Nude without an Arm, which was acquired by the Chicago collector Emily Crane Chadbourne in October 1909, belongs to a series of small-scale sculptures made early in the preceding year and in which Matisse reworked the motif to progressively eliminate more detail. He was inspired to make the first in the group, Small Crouching Nude with Arms (1908; fig. 14\u201315.5), by a photograph from Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Vignola\u2019s nude photographic revue, L\u2019\u00e9tudes acad\u00e9mique, in which a female model sits on one leg while bending tightly over the other, one arm bent and the other firmly planted on the ground in a \u201cgesture of despondency.\u201d Matisse modeled the clay form with his hands, paying special attention to the curve of the back and spine. Soon after, while attempting to show the sculpture to his patron Sarah Stein, who was also a student at his newly founded art school, Matisse broke its outstretched arm. Though he wanted to destroy it, Stein dissuaded him and instead he reworked the figure, obliterating detail as he solidified the form.\n\nFor this work, Matisse removed the base, smoothed the features, and filled once-empty spaces (see, for instance, the gaps below the chin and below the figure\u2019s right leg); his efforts made the figure more hunched and the pose more compressed. The result was Small Crouching Nude without an Arm, cast in bronze. Soon Matisse chose to revise the figure again, this time editing out the head, arms, and parts of the legs, focusing exclusively on the curving back so that the resulting egg-like form is completely closed (1908; fig. 14\u201315.6). Each time Matisse reworked these handheld forms he reinforced the strong, curving, compact shape of the back, which in turn informed his painting. Examination of Bathers with a Turtle reveals repeated reworking and readjustment of the poses of the figures: the crouching figure on the left, for example, was first painted with her head in profile and lower than it is at present. Her right arm, now reaching toward the turtle, was once closer to her torso, while her right knee extended beyond her arm, much like the right arm and leg in Small Crouching Nude with Arms. Matisse enlarged and altered the woman\u2019s curved back several times, reflecting the same evolution depicted in his three sculpted figures.\n\nStanding Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back relates to Matisse\u2019s work on the central figure of Bathers with a Turtle, which started in profile, shifted to a frontal view, and then finally arrived at the current orientation. Examination with infrared reflectography (fig. 14\u201315.7) reveals that while Matisse kept the left arm of the painted figure in more or less the same position, he repeatedly readjusted the right one as he made the posture more erect. The artist made similar changes in the drawing, leaving the earlier arm and leg positions visible. Choosing soft graphite, he was able to work the medium to produce broad lines that function as both shadow and volume, as well as reinforcement of the physical nature of his own experimentation. Matisse\u2019s many changes to the arms and back were not erased but enhanced by his use of the stump, or estompe, and incorporated into the final image. Indeed, what might have traditionally been called pentimenti in an earlier work can only be seen here as an integral part of the finished composition. As means of proof of the importance of such marks, Matisse selected Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back for his second exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s 291 Gallery, New York, which ran from February 23 to March 8, 1910. Given the importance of this event to the artist\u2019s continued patronage and career, we should take special note of the \u201cfinish\u201d Matisse wanted to present.\n\nIn the context of Matisse\u2019s various explorations of ways of reworking repeated motifs, Bathers with a Turtle and its related works are striking examples of his incorporation of visible change to generate and determine a composition\u2019s final form. Matisse\u2019s embrace of the concept of evolution in his working process would become an increasingly significant aspect of his artistic experimentation in the second decade of the twentieth century.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\n1951: Figure (Alfred H.

According to Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant, Archives Henri Matisse, the artist wrote on the verso of a photograph of Three Bathers: \u201cComposition: \u00c9tude pour la peinture \u2018Les Femmes \u00e0 la tortue.\u2019\u201d See Yve-Alain Bois, \u201cMatisse\u2019s Bathers with a Turtle, \u201dSaint Louis Art Museum Bulletin 22, no. 3 (Fall 1998): p. 19 n. 1. Henri and Am\u00e9lie Matisse were in Florence by July 18, where they visited Sandro Botticelli\u2019s Birth of Venus (1482\u201385) and Titian\u2019s Portrait of a Woman (1510\u201312); their tour also included Siena, Ravenna, Padua, and Venice. They returned to Collioure on August 14. For more on Matisse\u2019s time in Italy, see R\u00e9mi Labrusse and Jacqueline Munck, Matisse-Derain: La verit\u00e9 du fauvisme (Hazan, 2005), pp. 291\u201392.\n\nFor information on the continuation of idyllic painting, see Margaret Werth, The Joy of Life: The Idyllic in French Art, circa 1900 (University of California Press, 2002), esp. pp. 223\u201331. The women in Bathers with a Turtle, however, are all but divorced from any narrative\u2014gone is the recognizable landscape of earth, sea, and sky of the earlier paintings as well as the bouquets, clouds, drapery, hills, sailboats, and towels that suggested a leisure or vaguely Golden Age subject. Their gestures do not communicate a specific purpose, and the turtle itself is an enigmatic, unsettling element that calls attention to the nearby crouching bather, but for no clear reason. The figures are stripped and starkly bared against three plain horizontal bands, firmly separated from the traditional pastoral context in which it would have been permissible to view them.\n\nHenri Matisse, \u201cNotes d\u2019un peintre,\u201d La grande revue 2, no. 24 (Dec. 25, 1908), p. 736.\n\nFor more on Matisse\u2019s photographic sources, see Isabelle Monod-Fontaine, The Sculpture of Henri Matisse, exh. cat., trans. David Macey (Thames &amp; Hudson/Arts Council of Great Britain, 1984); and Ellen McBreen, Matisse\u2019s Sculpture: The Pinup and the Primitive (Yale University Press, 2014). Among the many contemporary paintings he used for inspiration, one of the most relevant is C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Large Bathers (1898\u20131905; Philadelphia Museum of Art), which was shown in a special exhibition at the 1907 Salon d\u2019Automne where Matisse also exhibited works, including Le luxe (I) (summer 1907; fig. 3). For more about C\u00e9zanne\u2019s impact on Matisse, see Yve-Alain Bois, \u201cC\u00e9zanne and Matisse: From Apprenticeship to Creative Misreading,\u201d in C\u00e9zanne and Beyond, exh. cat., ed. Joseph J. Rishel and Katherine Sachs (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2009), pp. 103\u201320. In the summer of 1907, Matisse added the work of artists he studied while visiting Italy to his list of sources: most significant for Bathers with a Turtle were Duccio\u2019s Maest\u00e0 (1308\u201311; Museo dell\u2019Opera del Duomo, Siena), the frescoes of Giotto\u2019s Scrovegni Chapel (1303\u201306) in Padua, those of Piero della Francesca in the Basilica di San Francesco (c. 1466) in Arezzo, and Andrea del Castagno\u2019s in Sant\u2019Apollonia (c. 1447\u201349) in Florence.\n\nMatisse, \u201cNotes d\u2019un peintre,\u201d p. 741.\n\nAlso related to this group is the somewhat larger bronze sculpture Seated Figure, Right Hand on Ground (1908; Duthuit 42). According to Lady Ottoline Morrell, an acquaintance of Emily Crane Chadbourne who accompanied her to visit Matisse for the first time: \u201cMiss Chadbourne and I sat on a chair on which a portfolio of his drawings were propped. He stood turning them over for us to see and choose one to buy. She appeared to take no interest, indeed hardly looked at the drawings, but from time to time picked off little bits of dust and fluff from her black skirt. She gave no heed to his remarks and explanations. When he had gone through the drawings she silently got up, without any comment, wandered round the room, took up a small bronze figure in her white-gloved hand and said she would like to buy it and walked out to her motor, Matisse bowing to her very graciously on seeing his bronze figure depart with her.\u201d See Gathorne-Hardy, Ottoline, p. 189. Chadbourne would go on to acquire several works by the artist in the coming years (see cat. 16, cat. 17, and cat. 43).\n\nMatisse owned this volume, which is currently housed in the Archives Henri Matisse, Paris; for more on this particular photograph, see McBreen, Matisse\u2019s Sculpture.\n\nAccording to Museum of Modern Art, Four Americans in Paris: The Collection of Gertrude Stein and Her Family (Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1970), p. 162, Sarah Stein told Mr. and Mrs. Lionel Steinberg, that Matisse had picked her up at their school in Paris for a walk in the rain and drew Small Crouching Nude with Arms from his raincoat pocket, breaking off the arm. He was greatly disturbed and wanted to destroy it, but she persuaded him not to, and he cast it without the arm.\n\nPentimenti are defined as the visible evidence of an alteration to a painting or drawing that traditionally suggest a change of mind on the part of an artist. The term can also refer to such effects when they do not signify a replacement but rather are part of alterations the artist made to the composition as he worked. In the context of Matisse\u2019s various explorations with ways of reworking and repeating motifs and compositions, the marks in Bathers with a Turtle indicate a mindful practice of incorporating change throughout a composition into the final form of a painting.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cats. 14\u201315 Left: Small Crouching Nude without an Arm, 1908 (cat. 14).
