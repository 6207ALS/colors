    "description": "<p>Around 1747 William Hogarth completed a series of history paintings that were much more serious in tone than the satirical works on which he had built his fame. This drawing and <em>Moses Brought to Pharaoh\u2019s Daughter</em> (2013.951) were both likely made after those paintings as studies for engravings. <em>Paul before Felix</em>, showing the apostle\u2019s self-defense, was commissioned for the chapel of Lincoln\u2019s Inn, where lawyers were admitted to the bar. <em>Moses</em> was similarly appropriate for its location, the London Foundling\u2019s Hospital, as it shows the prophet\u2019s mother reluctantly giving him up for adoption.</p>\n",
