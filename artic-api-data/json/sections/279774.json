II.3, II.4  \nSelected Literature: Way (1912), pp. 90\u201391\n\nWhistler\u2019s first experiment with color lithography was the only color project undertaken with the Way firm. His later color images (cat. 45, cat. 46, cat. 55, cat. 56, cat. 66, and cat. 67) were all produced in France with the assistance of the Parisian printer Henry Belfond. According to Thomas Way\u2019s invoices of 1895 and 1897 (app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 27 November 1890), the proofing of this image, revisions to the keystone, and printing of the color stones were all performed in November 1890. Whistler seems to have had some difficulty with the initial drawing; when the keystone was proved, the model\u2019s forearms and clasped hands printed heavily. T. R. Way (1912) recalled that the artist tried \u201cto retouch the black outline, but was not happy with the hands.\u201d Way also described how Whistler placed sheets of transparent transfer paper over impressions of the keystone, drawing the color additions on separate sheets. Apparently, the artist originally intended to add five colors to the outline. However, he mistakenly made the drawings for two of the colors, including the \u201cflesh tone,\u201d on the wrong side of the transfer paper, making them impossible to transfer. According to the printer, the stone was \u201cnever properly proved\u201d and \u201cthe whole set was erased.\u201d\n\nWhen Whistler sold one of the rare color impressions of this lithograph to Howard Mansfield in 1891, he called the image Pink Note, a title he also used for a number of pastels and watercolors (for example, M 900, 925, 1093, 1205). From the outset, Whistler\u2019s motivation for experimenting with color lithography seems to have been the desire to produce prints that resembled drawings colored with chalk, pastel, or watercolor.\n\nOnly one impression of the keystone, prior to alterations, has been located; it is in a private collection in Huntington Woods, Michigan. It is printed in black ink on grayish white chine (178 \u00d7 146 mm) mounted on white plate paper (framed).\n\nThe keystone has been scraped to lighten and clarify the model\u2019s hands and forearms and the rungs of the chairback. Registration marks for subsequent color printings have been added 34 mm above and 39 mm below the figure, but they do not appear on all impressions of this state.\n\nChicago: MWC, ivory wove paper (319 \u00d7 219 mm), with registration marks. Glasgow: HAG (2), ivory wove proofing paper (222 \u00d7 286 mm); ivory wove proofing paper (283 \u00d7 224 mm), with registration marks. Washington: FGA, off-white wove paper (383 \u00d7 279 mm), signed. Although printed on an unusually large sheet of paper, this impression lacks registration marks.\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Cleveland, CMA; and New Haven, YUAG.\n\nThe keystone remains unchanged, and three color stones have been added. These are printed in orange-red (additional shading in the background), rose-red (folds in the drapery), and gray-green inks (shading on the floor, and touches in the drapery, cap, and butterfly signature). The image has been enlarged by color additions, some very subtle, to the background and floor. Registration marks have been significantly reduced in size, and appear 15 mm above and 33 mm below the image.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove proofing paper (355 \u00d7 266 mm), signed, with registration marks; MWC, ivory wove paper (313 \u00d7 262 mm), signed and inscribed, in Howard Mansfield\u2019s hand, Obtained from Whistler, with registration marks. London: BM, off-white wove paper (351 \u00d7 244 mm), with registration marks. Washington: FGA, off-white wove paper (385 \u00d7 264 mm), with registration marks; NGA, white plate paper (385 \u00d7 263 mm), with registration marks (variant impression with pale yellow replacing the usual gray-green).\n\nRemarks: Other third-state impressions, all with registration marks, are found in New Haven, YUAG; New York, MMA (variant impression lacking the gray-green stone); and Williamstown, Mass., Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute.  \nNesta R.

Way stated that all color additions were drawn on transparent transfer paper, there is a significant difference in appearance between the orange-red areas and those printed in rose-red and gray-green that can be visually misleading. The orange-red additions have a crisp, grainy appearance similar to the keystone drawing, while the rose-red and gray-green passages are softer and less defined. Under magnification it is apparent that all the color additions were drawn on similar, if not identical, transfer papers. Differences in appearance are a result of the individual physical characteristics of the pigments used in the inks. Typically, gray-green and rose inks are more transparent and \u201cgreasier\u201d than inks made with earth pigments, like the black and orange-red used here.\n\nGUL NB1/75.
