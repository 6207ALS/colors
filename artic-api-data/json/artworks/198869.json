In this highly finished example, Langendijk presented the violent confrontation of mounted cavalry with foot soldiers. The drama of the foreground scene is further emphasized by the heavy smoke clouds in the middle and background, which are explained ultimately by the bright white explosion behind the church tower, in the upper right corner of the drawing.</p>\n",
