    "description": "<p>Goya\u2019s bold watercolor is very far from the emphasis on pure line of the restrained Classicism that characterizes many of the works from this period. Goya applied his washes with an abandon that verged on the abstract. Indeed, it can be difficult to separate the knot of individual figures, three of them carrying a fourth, in a scene that recalls images of the Deposition of Christ. Probably produced during the Spanish War of Independence against Napoleonic France (1808\u201314), Goya\u2019s drawing unflinchingly treats the senseless violence and social chaos that defined the period.</p>\n",
