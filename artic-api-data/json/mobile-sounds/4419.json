    "transcript": "<p>Mark DeLancey:  The way that he seated. And he seated with his legs splayed openly, and prominently displaying the phallus. We might call it man-spreading, which you might experience on The L from time to time.</p>\n<p>Mark DeLancey:  My name is Mark Deca [ph?] DeLancey. I'm associate professor of History of Art and Architecture at DePaul University. But it's the same sort of idea of taking up space. Being bigger than you normally would be, but also exposing oneself. The idea of the king exposing his fecundity publicly, right? so this is a sculpture of King Metang, he was tenth king of the Kingdom of Batoufam in the Grass Fields of Cameroon. In his left hand he holds a drinking horn. In the right hand he holds a palm wine calabash.</p>\n<p>These are essential parts of sort of the gear of kingship, if you want in the Cameroon Grass Fields. The king is seen to hold lifeforce, if you want, something that he can share with his population through palm wine, through spraying palm wine from his mouth over those assembled before him. And while one might not think that having palm wine spat upon one is a very nice thing, in the Cameroon grass fields, it's perceived as a form of blessing. Of blessing one with the lifeforce of the king, and thereby extending from the king the capacity to succeed, to produce wealth, to reproduce and have children, all flowing from the king.</p>\n",
