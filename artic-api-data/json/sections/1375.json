Seipp Fund, 1952.1097\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">John Burt was the founding member of a renowned Boston family of silversmiths, which included his sons Samuel, William, and Benjamin (see cat. 35). He was born in Boston and probably apprenticed with John Coney between 1707 and 1714. Compared to some of his peers, his involvement in civic affairs was limited. He was active in real estate speculation and began buying land in Maine ifign the late 1720s. Eventually, he and a number of others subdivided a tract of more than ten thousand acres in York County. At the time of Burt\u2019s death, he had an extensive inventory of tools, indicating that he was active as a silversmith until the end of his life. More than 180 objects with his mark survive, a significant portion of which is hollowware, including commissions from Harvard College and New England churches.\n\nUsually made in pairs, silver chafing dishes were luxury goods, deemed finer than their humbler cousins in ceramic or brass. They were used to heat food, beverages, plates, and bowls and may also have served as stands for teakettles. Among the early American examples of the form are a pair by Coney in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, both of which are straight-sided, lack handles, and feature bird-like claws that originally grasped insulating wooden balls. Other early examples are one with the mark of Edward Winslow (see cat. 9) and another by Peter van Dyck, whose supports for the legs and rests hug the bowl. Their English counterparts date from the mid-seventeenth century; in his diary the English politician and government administrator Samuel Pepys records buying a silver chafing dish for warming plates in 1666.\n\nLater American examples, such as those by Burt, have legs that stand proud of the burner with boldly curved opposing C-scroll shapes. In line with the usual pattern for such objects, the chafing dish has a mate, which is now in the Colonial Williamsburg collection. Both have three hoof feet and corresponding rim knops, sides pierced with leafage and vertical flutes, and a boldly turned baluster handle\u2014all features that would have made the object a resplendent presence on the dining table. The three knops at the rim were designed to support a plate, probably of silver or pewter, since ceramic plates could not withstand the heat from the coals. An interior grate, removable by loosening a nut on the underside, held hot coals.\n\nThe bottom of this chafing dish bears the inscriptions M / J = Mand John C. Phillips / from his Mother / Nov. 5, 1915 / From the Phillips family / old silver. In addition to the monogram M / I M, notes on the second dish identify traces of an earlier IW monogram. Earlier research suggests that the M / J = M monogram was for Jonathan and Miriam Mason of Boston, who were married in 1747. It was further stated in correspondence from the dealer James Graham, Jr., to the Art Institute\u2019s curator Meyric R. Rogers that the couple\u2019s daughter Miriam married Lieutenant Governor William Phillips (1750\u20131827) in 1774 and that the dishes entered the Phillips family through this marriage. Given the earlier monogram and the fact that the Mason marriage took place a year or two after Burt\u2019s death, it is unlikely that Jonathan and Miriam Mason were the original owners. The John C. Phillips who sold the chafing dishes in 1952 was descended from a different William Phillips (1737\u20131772) and his wife, Margaret Wendell Philipps (1739\u20131823), not the William Phillips who married Miriam Mason. In her will Margaret Wendell Phillips, John C. Phillips\u2019s great-great-grandmother, left \u201cmy pair of chafing dishes\u201d to her son John Phillips, and from there the chafing dishes descended through four successive generations of John Phillipses to the last owner. While Margaret Phillips did not inherit the chafing dishes from Miriam and Jonathan Mason, she may have purchased them from the Masons or from another source linked to the monogram M / J = M.  \nPatricia Kane\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">Twice on bottom (fig. 19.1)\n\nEngraved on bottom: M / J = M (fig. 19.2)\n\nEngraved on bottom: John C.
