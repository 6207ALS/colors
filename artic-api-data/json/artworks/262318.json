    "description": "<p>David Laurence Painter (b. 1913) was among the early students in the Industrial Design program at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, enrolling in 1933 and receiving his diploma in 1936. Painter was vice president in charge of design at the Chicago design firm of Barnes &amp; Reinecke, later becoming co-head of the product styling division. In 1950, Painter and two colleagues bought the company\u2019s design interests and formed their independent partnership, Painter/Teague/Petertil, Industrial Designers. After 1960, Painter worked independently and in other partnerships. His work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Smithsonian, and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Painter\u2019s own design work and the work of his firms are well documented in this collection of office papers, project files, correspondence, various product advertisements and brochures, photographs, and slides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Painter,%20David,%20papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Painter,%20David,%20papers/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
