    "description": "<p>Described in the 1950s as \u201cone of the leading designers of our day,\u201d Vladimir Kagan found inspiration in both modern and traditional forms, from avant-garde European paintings to Russian folk art. For this table, Kagan\u2019s muse was Constantin Brancusi\u2019s sculpture <em>Bird in Space</em>, whose subtle, tapering curves inspired the spectacular base, a design that Kagan described as one of his favorites. While the pointed thrust of the table evokes the aerodynamics of the nascent space age, the tabletop owes a debt to the undulating, biomorphic shapes of Surrealism. Despite these cutting-edge associations, the table also represents a departure from the machine aesthetic of earlier decades and a return to handcrafting: with his business partner, Hugo Dreyfuss, Kagan designed all his furnishings, which were custom-made under the supervision of his father, Illi, a trained cabinetmaker.</p>\n",
