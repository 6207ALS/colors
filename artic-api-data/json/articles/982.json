    "copy": " March 29, 2021 Dear Mr. Cezanne, Some months back, I received a kind invitation on your behalf: would I take a look at your Three Skulls (Trois Cr\u00e2nes) \u2014the watercolor\u2019d one\u2014to note some thoughts and then, prospectively, to further shape my \u201cseeing\u201d for intended publication? My \u201cyes\u201d confirmed: it would be an honor and a privilege. Accordingly, I have carried the \u201cpictured\u201d image and its given title\u2014back-of-mind, front-of-mind\u2014brave allies to my waking consciousness, yet rattled by the force of facts and of convergences that haunt us: pandemic illness, death, and other forms of loss\u2014a year of seasons from that first, invited moment. I\u2019ve been fortunate to see Trois Cr\u00e2nes twice over and with expert guidance, in the calibrated light of the Art Institute\u2019s conservation lab.   This study has now taken such an inward turn that I am moved to address my account to you directly: to send these few abbreviated notes and queries, as if reporting back\u2014or forward, to the yet-unknown. What follows is surely incomplete, as you well understand: how pictures wait, impatient for another view? But this I know and must confirm: your solemn trio illuminates a shared and challenged present-tense, yet also signals, prescient: that silent pact we each must make with our own life, that will have been. Yours and truly, JF / Chicago   from a viewing and a second look Freed from its frame displayed recumbent: a palpable weight. I offer to assist: we lift the work with cautious care \u2014 Three Skulls now steadied\u2014 inclining at the table-easel.   It seems a faint-tint wash prepared the sheet from edge to edge in partnership with fleeting graphite clues: what\u2019s underlaid retains a luminescent glow\u2014 proof enough to name the color: skull. Although unsettled, settled-in: one: a furrowed-brow betrays the centered elder\u2014wisdom wedged between the younger pair.   two: at left\u2014advancing, fearless ! the carmine droplets at right\u2014accepting fate\u2009? or numb to it. three: snugged-up\u2014 as if a selfie wincing, over-run by angled light.   ensemble\u2019d: incisors sunken, caught in scalloped-bone-edged mutterance [ dismayed by absent tongues and mandibles gone missing ] \u2014yet dignified in tablescape\u2019d embrace: a sympathetic garden.   Occurs to me to test the title-words another way: the three of skulls . . . to face the image as if dealt\u2014 or having drawn\u2014the card, in turn. Now, as noted in proximity: see where the brush-point arcs those lines shared by skull and air\u2014 or air and wall \u2014or skull when edged with verdant tapestry.   Each searched-for, flourished mark: an agitated wavering deliberate or hesitant disclosed by unforgiving paper.   Each absent place an eye should be drinks-in the spectrum of its circumstance: thin\u2019d red with blue marks one against a yellow\u2019d pool the other five make what they will from annotated variants: sparks or faded notes of green gray\u2019d-blues indigos with cobalt-bits water\u2019d-sepias blotched-pinks from red ochre\u2019d-mauves and violets.   Each absent nose inhales an ever-shaded-palette-scent. Each brush-marked gap proposes \u201cinside-ness\u201d\u2014 invokes a dome we cannot see: where thought and recollection once prevailed. \u2014Julia Fish March 29, 2021   Julia Fish's essay on Cezanne's Three Skulls first appeared in print in the catalogue for the exhibition Cezanne , along with essays by fellow artists Etel Adnan, Ellen Gallagher, and Kerry James Marshall, among others; art historical entries; and contributions from Art Institute conservators.
