    "title": "Hairy but True!",
    "copy": " It\u2019s Hairy Who true. The six young artists who exhibited in the mid- to late 1960s under the name Hairy Who\u2014Jim Falconer, Art Green, Gladys Nilsson, Jim Nutt, Suellen Rocca, and Karl Wirsum\u2014drew inspiration from everyday materials: advertisements, comics, posters, and sales catalogs. They also developed a practice, beginning with their first exhibition at the Hyde Park Art Center in 1966, of using the comic book form to create inexpensive catalogs documenting their shows. While their exhibitions featured each individual\u2019s artworks, these promotional exhibition catalogs and posters evidence the truly collaborative spirit of the group.   Jim Nutt discovered the ad showing two men fighting over a pair of purportedly tear-resistant boxers and cut it down the center. He kept the left half as source material for a print that he would work on in Sacramento and sent the right half to Jim Falconer in Chicago.   Nutt transformed the staid, clean-cut boxer tugger into a hulking, grimacing figure\u2014part superhero, part craggy antihero\u2014using electric colors and his usual irreverent style. His addition of the images of a black cat and log that together represent \u201ccat-a-log\u201d and the figure\u2019s cheeky request to \u201cGimme one dollar\u201d\u2014the cost of the publication\u2014are exemplars of his and the group\u2019s puns and word play.   Falconer used his half to create a graphite drawing, recasting the neatly coiffed gentleman in his undergarments as a monstrous, almost alien figure with a misshapen head, bulging eyes, and wildly wagging nose. He sent his drawing, which was recently acquired for the museum through the generosity of Janet and Craig Duchossois, back to Nutt in Sacramento, who used it to ink the key black outlines on the print version.   Nutt took artistic license to insert subtle changes, such as the position and activity of the Washington Monument and the presence and location of text.   These two final prints became the covers of the catalog for the Hairy Who\u2019s sixth and final exhibition in Washington, DC, in 1969. The two recent acquisitions\u2014the ad that served as a springboard for their inventions and Falconer\u2019s original graphite drawing\u2014join the final cover prints to offer a glimpse at the Hairy Who\u2019s transformation of source material and their collaborative working methods in the Art Institute's Hairy Who survey . The exhibition\u2014the first devoted to the group\u2014is open now through January 6, 2019. \u2014Lauren Schultz ",
