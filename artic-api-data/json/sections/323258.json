In the seventeenth century, the impasse des Carm\u00e9lites led from the rue Saint Jacques to a Carmelite convent (Carmel de L\u2019Incarnation) and then to the back of a monastery facing the rue d\u2019Enfer (now rue Henri-Barbusse), but after the Revolution the neighborhood changed rapidly, and many of the original buildings were destroyed. Whistler\u2019s lithograph shows the intrusion of a modest workshop into an imposing earlier structure. The impasse des Carm\u00e9lites has disappeared and only a \u201csordide courette\u201d at 284, rue St. Jacques marks its location today.\n\nThe transfer drawing for The Whitesmiths, Impasse des Carm\u00e9lites must have been made several days prior to 22 July 1894. On that date, Whistler referred to the lithograph in two different letters. In one of them, he urged the editor Gleeson White to visit the Way offices in order to see some new lithographs just being proved by the printers, and he mentioned the \u201cRetameur Impasse des\u201d as a subject White might wish to consider for publication. On the same day, he included The Retameur on a list of new lithographs being sent to the dealer Edward Kennedy in New York.\n\nAlthough Whistler was pleased with the lithograph when he saw the first proofs, he apparently changed his mind about the image as time passed. In February 1895 he wrote to Kennedy that he planned to destroy the stone for The Retameur. In November of that year, Whistler crossed Tinsmith l\u2019Impasse du Carm. off a list of lithographs to be framed for the Fine Art Society exhibition due to open on December 4. Although the stone survived to be printed by Goulding in 1903, there is no evidence to suggest that the Ways ever printed from it again after the initial set of twenty-five impressions (plus a few proofs) had been pulled.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 230 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (335 \u00d7 240 mm), signed.

London: BM, ivory wove proofing paper (244 \u00d7 195 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid Japanese vellum (339 \u00d7 238 mm), signed; NGA, cream laid Japanese vellum (335 \u00d7 237 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Brooklyn, TBM; and New York, MMA. The Brooklyn impression, printed on the \u201cordinary\u201d wove paper that the Ways used for proofing, must have slipped in the press, resulting in a slight double-printing of the image. There is also a very pale impression on the verso. Interestingly, Whistler signed this less-than-perfect impression with his butterfly monogram.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.
