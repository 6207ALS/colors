    "description": "<p>In 1871 Timothy O\u2019Sullivan, who had gained acclaim photographing the Civil War, was recruited by George M. Wheeler of the U.S. War Department to join a government survey of lands west of the 100th meridian. Working alongside scientists and cartographers, O\u2019Sullivan produced large-format prints for study and official use, as well as stereographic cards for a general audience. Stereographs were made by taking two photographs of the same scene with lenses about two and a half inches apart to match the distance between human eyes. Viewed through a stereoscope, the two images combine to give the illusion of deep space. Hugh Edwards acquired several O\u2019Sullivan works, including the complete two-volume Wheeler survey and boxed stereo set from which this image comes, as well as the photographs he made for <em>Gardner\u2019s Photographic Sketch Book of the War</em>, published by Alexander Gardner.</p>\n",
