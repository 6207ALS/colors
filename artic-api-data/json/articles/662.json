    "copy": " As we celebrate the arrival of 2018, here\u2019s a nod to new years long ago. This ancient Roman flask\u2014just three inches long\u2014was fashioned in the 1st century AD from amber-colored glass in the shape of a date, a symbol for the new year and a fruit often given as a gift on the occasion. Used as a container for oils and perfumes, the flask features realistic, smooth bends and folds that suggest the mold used to make it was cast from an actual dried date. For much of the 1st century, mold-blown glass objects like this one were luxuries available only to the wealthy, but this changed toward the end of the century, when technological innovations in glassblowing made these goods available to people of more modest means. Such molds could be used to create exact replicas in whimsical shapes like this, which were quite popular. Consider celebrating the new date by eating or giving a date\u2014and stop by the museum to see this playful object for yourself. Take a closer look at Flask in the Shape of a Date . ",
