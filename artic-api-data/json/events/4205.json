    "description": "<p>One of the first to compose for the combination of string quartet and piano, Schumann's Piano Quintet embodies his wife Clara's sentiment that all of the composer's work are \"orchestral in feeling.\" Widely considered America's first successful female composer, Amy Beach embraces the same romantic, melody-laden style of Schumann in her lushly sentimental Piano Quintet. Composer Ruth Crawford Seeger fearlessly sought out her own compositional voice, and her trailblazing <em>String Quartet 1931</em> refreshes a centuries-old instrumental genre with bold dissonance. The afternoon's postconcert gallery talk showcases pioneering women artists across a variety of mediums and time periods.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p>",
