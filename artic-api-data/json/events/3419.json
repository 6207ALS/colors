    "description": "<p>Influential artist Amy Sillman produces a diverse body of work that actively engages with formal aspects of painting and various ideas that surround it. She is most known for her multilayered paintings, which combine suggestions of cartoon-like limbs with abstract shapes, a range of vibrant and murky colors, and lush, overlapping brushstrokes. Over the past few years she has developed her drawings into animations, published a \u2018zine to accompany her painting exhibitions, and devoted much time to exploring color, time, feminism, and writing.</p>",
