The remarkable figure on the reverse, however, gives us some context. The image is not merely the personification of Roma (which had appeared on Roman coins since the early Republic) but is a celebration of the newly official cult of the goddess Roma (Dea Roma), inaugurated by Hadrian. She had actually been a fixture of Hellenistic religion for a long time, and it is not surprising that the philhellene Hadrian was the one to bring the cult to the capital. Besides the issues of coins in her honor, Dea Roma received her own temple in Rome, a double temple in fact, back to back with the other tutelary goddess of Rome, Venus. The temple of Venus and Rome was, when completed, the largest in the city, located between the Roman Forum and the Flavian amphitheater (Hadrian had to move the colossal statue of Nero in order to build his temple). The land on which it was to be built was consecrated on April 21, Rome\u2019s \u201cbirthday,\u201d as the Parilia festival was called; the festival was now renamed the Romaia. The consecration of this temple to Rome the Goddess took place in 121, the year Hadrian celebrated the fifth anniversary of his reign; it is likely that this magnificent coin was issued at the same time.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Mols, \u201cCult of Roma Aeterna.\u201d\n\nBoatwright, Hadrian and the City of Rome, pp. 119\u201333; see also Mattingly, \u201cSome Historical Coins of Hadrian.\u201d\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 50 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Hadrian, A.D. 120/23\n\n</section>",
