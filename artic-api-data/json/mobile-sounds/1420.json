    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: When English designer William Godwin created this sideboard in the late nineteenth century contemporary decorative taste usually called for more elaborate ornament. His design was unique in its simplicity with slender lines articulating the spaces between cabinets.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: Because of the stock geometry of the piece, the linearity, it was pure form rather than overstuffed and overloaded and over decorated.</p>\n<p>Narrator:  That was Ghenete Zelleke, curator of European decorative arts. Godwin\u2019s artistic appreciation for the grid like arrangement of Japanese design influenced the structure of this side board. But this lightweight piece also has practical advantages. Notice the ample space around the legs.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: He abhorred dust and dirt collecting under furniture and that\u2019s a reason why he lifted the side board so far off the floor so that it would be easy to clean underneath it.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Structurally the cabinet is made in two parts with the upper half fitted into the long horizontal plane of the sideboard. In addition, the side panels at the level of the desk could be lowered or raised according to need. Such flexibility permitted the piece to be displayed in variously sized rooms. In Godwin\u2019s sideboard beauty and function combine elegantly.</p>\n",
