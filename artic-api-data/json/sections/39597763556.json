The impressions evidence the damage sustained to the surface of the block in the twenty-year interval between its printing by Pola Gauguin and its printing by Kahn. To easily identify the Print and Drawing Club\u2013commissioned printing, each impression was stamped on the verso (see fig. 55.6.1). Additionally, the impressions were printed on a very glossy paper used for commercial purposes. Paper of this type was unavailable until the early twentieth century.\n\nIn addition to the posthumous printing of a standard edition of 150 impressions, Kahn also printed a group of seven \u201cexperimental\u201d impressions using a variety of inking and wiping techniques, perhaps in an exercise to visually re-create Gauguin\u2019s printed surfaces. Today this group of prints forms a valuable resource for teaching and study purposes (see also cat. 55.1).\n\nThis print is one of the edition of 150 impressions and was printed in black ink on cream wove paper.\n\nThe cream wove paper is very glossy on both the recto and verso. It is a poor quality, machine-made paper that likely contains kaolin (est.), a clay filler. When paper pulp that contains a clay filler is run through metal rollers in the manufacturing process, the paper becomes glossy. Often these types of paper are made with poor-quality paper fibers that include wood pulp, and over time they tend to darken and become brittle. They are most often used in the printing of magazines and periodicals and are not considered fine-art papers.\n\n203 \u00d7 352 mm (image); 247 \u00d7 400 mm (sheet)\n\nThe impression from the posthumous edition is in pristine condition.  \nHarriet K.
