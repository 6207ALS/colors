He used a small piece of coarsely grained wood, in contrast to the fine-grained boxwood used for Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) and Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). As in his Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105), this wood likely derived from an indigenous source that Gauguin himself prepared for carving and printing.\n\nTahitians, Flowers and Leaves was never realized as a headpiece in any of the nine published issues of Le sourire. In the facsimile edition it is reproduced among a group of six wood-block prints, none of which appeared paired with text in any of the published issues of the journal.\n\nThe impression was printed in black ink.\n\nThe thin sheet of mitsumata (est.) paper presents a delicate laid and chain line pattern. There are small fibrous clumps and inclusions throughout. It is an absorbent Japanese paper that took the ink readily from the block, resulting in a soft, rich impression. The sheet is scissor cut along the right and bottom edges. In order to successfully print such a thin sheet, a more substantial secondary paper was likely used as a carrier to help facilitate lifting the mitsumata paper from the inked block. This contrasts with another impression in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, which is printed on a harder, sized, Western wove paper (cat. 119.2).\n\n104 \u00d7 183 mm (image); 123 \u00d7 215 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print is sound, stable condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.

Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints (cats. 91\u2013105) and various prints for Le sourire revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nMarcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.
