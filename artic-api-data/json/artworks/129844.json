In its laser-like focus on one cavalry soldier and his charging horse in the heat of battle, this drawing\u2019s romantic intensity departs radically from the Classical restraint of many works of the period.<br>G\u00e9ricault exoticized his horseman, giving him African features and clothing him in the garb of an Ottoman mamluk, a caste of Muslim slave soldiers who fought for their indepe-dence in Egypt in the early 1800s. The artist was politically progressive for his time and championed the cause of liberty with this image. However, mamluks were most often of Turkic, Coptic, or Circassian descent, and G\u00e9ricault\u2019s depiction may not have been historically accurate.</p>\n",
