    "description": "First created in the 1930\u2019s, Blackwing built a cult following that included John Steinbeck and Chuck Jones, who proudly used Blackwings to create Bugs Bunny and many other Looney Tunes characters. Blackwing pencils are made with the finest materials in the world, including Genuine Incense-cedar from California and premium Japanese graphite. A portion of the sales from all Blackwing products benefit the Blackwing Foundation and its mission to keep arts and music programs in public schools. Blackwing Matte pencils come in a 12-pack gift box that also doubles as a pencil cup.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.13 x 1.63 x 1.63 in.</li></ul>",
