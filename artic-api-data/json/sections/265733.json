R. Way sent Whistler a block of transfer paper and some hard lithographic crayons, and the artist resumed his work in lithography after a hiatus of eight years. With these materials in hand, he set off to draw three lithographs (cat. 20, cat. 21, and cat. 22) in the neighborhood of St. Bartholomew\u2019s, an area he had already explored while making numerous etchings of the markets, shops, and bustling alleyways of London\u2019s East End. This sketch of the entrance gate leading to the old priory church of St. Bartholomew the Great was one of the three.\n\nSitting within the churchyard and looking out through the gate, Whistler captured the essentials of the site with rapid, economical strokes. The metal gates, pointed archway, ornamental lettering with the name of the church, metal cross, and gas lamp that the artist recorded in his lithograph can be readily identified in a roughly contemporary photograph taken from the opposite side of the gate (fig. 20a). In its brevity, centered focus, and lively linear pattern, the image resembles many of the artist\u2019s etchings of Chelsea and the East End dating from about this time (for example, K 281, 300, 303).\n\nFew proofs were pulled of Entrance Gate. Although T. R. Way thought highly enough of this lithograph to ask Whistler\u2019s permission to use it as the frontispiece to his catalogue of the artist\u2019s lithographs, Whistler refused (letter 152; app. IV.10). The fact that Rosalind Birnie Philip (Whistler\u2019s sister-in-law and executrix) inherited six of the twelve impressions recorded by Way suggests that it found few buyers.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove paper (317 \u00d7 202 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (302 \u00d7 205 mm), signed.
