    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  This face was created during the short lived Sui Dynasty which we reigned at the turn of the sixth century A.D. Elinor Pearlstein, the Art Institute\u2019s associate curator of Chinese art notes he vessel is unusual in several respects.<br>Elinor Pearlstein:  It\u2019s a very graceful piece with an ovoid body that gently contracts to this very slender flaring neck and cupped mouth. What is most notable about it though is the glaze, this olive green that we call celadon. Celadon is a western term and is thought to be derived from the name of character in the seventeenth century French comedy who wore a grayish-green robe.<br>Narrator:  Celadon is among the earliest type of Chinese stoneware. It\u2019s range of soft olive and blueish greens was created when the iron rich glaze as fired in a kiln with little oxygen.<br>Elinor Pearlstein:  You can also see that fine cracks have formed across the glaze. This is an accident. It\u2019s caused when the body shrinks at a different rate than the glaze. Later on that crackle becomes quite deliberate for decorative effect.<br>Narrator:  The pooling and darkening of the glaze around the raised ridges and the thick drips near the bottom were also quite unintentional. Note the lion-like masks encircling the shoulder. These images originated in an independent kingdom near present day cashmere and reached China via the flourishing trade routes across Central Asia.&quot;</p>\n",
