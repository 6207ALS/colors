    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This 18th Century clock with its extravagant design and sophisticated interior mechanism would have been extremely expensive.  The case was made by Jean-Pierre Latz who was cabinet maker to King Louis XV of France.  Its mass of intertwining rococo curves incorporating leaves, tendrils and floral garlands is made from gilt bronze.  The clock is surmounted by the figure of Apollo, Classical God of Music and Rationality.  He leans down the slay a winged serpent emerging dramatically from a cavern beneath the clock face.  Under the serpent, the face of Hera, Classical Goddess of Marriage and Childbirth appears, she gives a clue to the reason for the clock's existence.  If you look just above her head, you will see two small coats of arms held by lions, these belong to a Flemish couple whose marriage the clock was probably made to celebrate.  Inside, the clock has an extraordinarily complex eight day movement which could play music as well as tell time.</p>\n",
