    "description": "<p>Luxury textiles were symbols of power, wealth, and status in Islamic lands where they set standards of beauty and drove economies, fueling prosperity and urbanization. They were essential embellishments in lavish ceremonial pageantry, dressing up rulers and their courts, palaces, and tents. Gold textiles served as predecessors of the red carpet, covering the pathways of receptions. Islamic dress incorporated the distinct styles of vast territories, such as loose untailored garments, tunics and wraps, and fitted sleeved garments with trousers. Rulers frequently bestowed elaborate robes of honor, composed of multiple items of dress, as symbols of status on courtiers and visiting dignitaries to mark significant occasions. This presentation features a rich variety of luxury textiles that were vital components in dressing up the Islamic lands. </p><p>Louise Mackie is one of the world\u2019s leading authorities on Islamic textiles. She recently retired from the Cleveland Museum of Art, where she served since 1998 as curator of their renowned textile collection and also as curator of Islamic art. She previously held senior curatorial positions at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and the Textile Museum in Washington, D.C. Her most recent book, <em>Symbols of Power: Luxury Textiles from Islamic Lands, 7th\u201321st Century</em>, represents the first comprehensive survey of the subject. She holds a BA in art history from Wells College and an MA in Islamic art from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University.</p><p><strong>This is the third program of the four-part lecture-luncheon series. </strong>Registration for each event includes lecture, regionally-specific luncheon, and a paired glass of wine.</p><p>About <em>Encounters with Asia</em></p><p><strong><em>Dressing Up: Ceremony and Celebration</em></strong> is the fifth annual lecture-luncheon series co-organized by the Department of Asian Art and its affiliate organization, the <a href=\"/join-and-give/affiliate-groups/asian-art-council\">Asian Art Council</a>.
