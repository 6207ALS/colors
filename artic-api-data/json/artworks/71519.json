This example has been attributed to the workshop of the prolific Master of the Ghent Privileges, and characteristically ornaments a sequence of prayers and devotional reading to be recited at precisely set times of the day and night.  Images such as this tender scene of the encounter between the Virgin and her cousin Saint Elizabeth, both miraculously with child, helped introduce the different segments of the Hours of the Virgin, the core section of all Books of Hours.</p>\n",
