    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Bruce Boucher, Curator of European sculpture.</p>\n<p>BRUCE BOUCHER:  Francesco Mochi's Bust of a Youth is one of our signature pieces, and it is one of the most beautiful Baroque sculptures in the collection. It shows a youth, an adolescent, with corkscrew curls and drapery that suggests he may or may not be the young Saint John the Baptist. But it is a portrait of adolescence, he has a rather dreamy expression and his lips are parted as if he is about to speak, or has just said something. It's the kind of animated expression that Baroque sculptors like Mochi would use, to try to transcend the limitations of marble as a medium.</p>\n<p>BRUCE BOUCHER  He could carve marble like butter. And if you look at these curls, you could put your finger through them, they are really a tour de force of sculpture. What is Baroque about this, is the way in which.. the sculptor is trying to engage us in a kind of imaginary discourse with the sitter. The figure's head is turned sharply to the side, his eyes are focused, his mouth is open. There's a sense of movement about it, which distinguishes it from a Renaissance sculpture, which would probably have been much more passive and less engaged with us as spectators.</p>\n",
