The message carved on each of the figurines explained that if the deceased is called on to do any work in the afterlife, the ushabti will respond with \u201cHere I am\u201d and will do the job. Some tombs had as many as one ushabti for every day of the year and another 36 overseers to keep order. All but the poorest citizens provided themselves with some kind of funerary furnishings. Products for burial and the labor to produce them made up a large industry in Egypt.</p>\n",
