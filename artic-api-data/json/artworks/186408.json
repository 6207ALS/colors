    "description": "<p>Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld became a member of the Nazarene Brotherhood in Rome at an early age and adopted their historicizing linearity and interest in Renaissance artists Raphael and Albrecht D\u00fcrer. King Ludwig I of Bavaria, an enthusiastic promoter of German national culture, commissioned Schnorr von Carolsfeld to paint fresco murals of scenes from German history for his royal residence. This monumental study for the Charlemagne room depicts the emperor defeating the Saxon leader Wittekind at Fritzlar near B\u00fcrberg, which occurred in the eighth century. Placed before the B\u00fcrberg church and flanked by angels, Charlemagne is depicted as the protector and patron of the Christian state.</p>\n",
