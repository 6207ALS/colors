    "description": "<p>Text printed on reverse of stereocard:</p>\n<p>Johnny lived in the house next to Peggy's. One time his uncle sent him three little puppies to keep for his very own, and he was delighted with them.  He took them over into Peggy's yard to play.  &quot;Let's play farmer, Peggy,&quot; he said.  Peggy thought that would be fun, but she would have to have some animals, too.  Johnny said she might be Mrs. Farmer and do the housekeeping, but she said she wanted to be a man if Johnny was.<br>Now Peggy's brother had a great lot of rabbits which he kept in a kind of coop called a hutch.  He often allowed Peggy to help him feed them, but not to let them out of the rabbit hutch.  When Peggy needed some animals so badly to stock her farm, she thought of the rabbits at once.  She was sure brother would not care, if he knew.  So she and Johnny opened the door of the rabbit hutch and coaxed the pretty creatures out.  There were black ones, and they had long silky ears that you could lift them by and not hurt a mite.  See how tame they look in the picture, with one of Johnny's puppies hiding among them!</p>\n<p>Oh, but Peggy and Johnny had a lovely time playing farmer that day! But when Peggy's brother came home from school, he had to hunt ever so long for some of the rabbits, and some of them he never found at all.  And that night farmer Peggy was sent to bed without any supper, and so was farmer Johnny. Wasn't that pretty hard?</p>\n",
