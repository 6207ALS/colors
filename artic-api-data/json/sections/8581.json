The project\u2019s impetus and funding came from the Getty Foundation. The initial coding and technical implementation was researched and executed by the IMA Lab, a web design and development consultancy of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nWe recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.\n\nWe welcome your questions and comments about the publication at OnlineCatalogueFeedback@artic.edu.\n\nBelow are examples of how to cite the different elements of this catalogue.\n\nJay A.
