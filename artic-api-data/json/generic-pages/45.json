Historic Architecture and Landscape Image Collection, about 1865\u20131973 (bulk 1890\u20131945) Approximately 15,000 images [P] Consisting of approximately 15,000 images that document the architecture, landscape and urban planning of sites across the United States\u2014with a particular emphasis on Chicago and its suburbs\u2014and, to a lesser extent, internationally, The Historic Architecture and Landscape Image collection, or HALIC, contains mounted photographic prints, lantern slides (both black and white and hand-colored), and postcards dating from the 1860s to the 1970s. These materials supplement, extend, and support the architectural groupings described above, with particular focus on the work of the first Chicago School, the Prairie School, and Beaux-Arts urban planning activities inspired by Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett. This collection will be added to on a periodic basis. Of particular note is a large body of lantern slides that was gathered by the Chicago Plan Commission, representing the international influences of Chicago's urban planning ideals during the 1910s and 1920s. HALIC also contains a significant number of pre-Civil War, vernacular, and anonymous buildings, as well as images from many of the expositions and world's fairs that took place around the turn of the 20th-century, most notably the World's Columbian Exposition (1893), and the Century of Progress Exhibition (1933\u20131934), both in Chicago. The mounted photographs come from many sources, but most were taken by professional architectural photographers. Included are large groups of photographs by the Chicago Aerial Photography Company (active about 1920\u20131940), the Detroit Photographic Company/Detroit Publishing Company (active 1898\u20131924), Henry Fuermann and Sons (Frank Lloyd Wright's preferred photographers), Albert Levy (active 1890s), and J.W. Taylor (active 1885\u20131910). The lantern slides represent the work of numerous photographers and slide-makers, including George W. Bond and Company, Chicago Transparency Company, Curtis and Miller, the Detroit Photographic Company/Detroit Publishing Company, the Historic American Buildings Survey, Frances Benjamin Johnston, Alvina Lenke Studios, T.H. McAllister, A.G. McGregor, L. Manasse, Grace Nichols, Underwood and Underwood, and Edward Van Altena.
