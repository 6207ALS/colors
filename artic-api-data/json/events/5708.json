    "description": "<p>While Ellsworth Kelly (American, 1923\u20132015) is remembered today for his enduring influence on post-war abstract painting, sculpture, and printmaking, the artist was also a dedicated and prolific portraitist, who drew likenesses of himself and his friends throughout his long life. </p><p>In this discussion of <a href=\"/exhibitions/9663/ellsworth-kelly-portrait-drawings\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Ellsworth Kelly: Portrait Drawings</em></a>, chair and curator of Prints and Drawings Kevin Salatino considers these little-known portraits\u2014brought together as a coherent body of work for the first time in this exhibition\u2014within the context of Kelly's 70-year career. Join Salatino to discover the complex relationships between these experimental, self-exploratory drawings and Kelly's more public-facing work.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
