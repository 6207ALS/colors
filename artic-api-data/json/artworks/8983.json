    "description": "<p>Vasily Kandinsky,  along with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/16157\">Franz Marc</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/44013\">Gabriele M\u00fcnter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35113\">Alexei Jawlensky</a>, was a founding member of Blaue Reiter (Blue Rider), a loose alliance of artists based in Munich. Often working in a common palette using expressive brushwork, they shared a belief in the symbolic and spiritual importance of forms and colors, including their effect on emotions and memories. Blaue Reiter also promoted a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting, looking to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art for inspiration. Here the troika, a traditional carriage drawn by three horses, and the hand-painted frame, which Kandinsky made especially for this work, speak to the powerful influence these sources had on the artist.</p>\n",
