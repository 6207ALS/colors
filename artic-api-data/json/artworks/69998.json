    "description": "<p>American expatriate Walter Gay devoted the majority of his professional career to painting small-scale, richly adorned interiors like this one. <em>The Commode</em> depicts the Rococo-inspired salon at Ch\u00e2teau du Br\u00e9au, the artist\u2019s residence outside Paris. Although he typically did not portray people in his works, Gay suggested their presence through the use of mirrors, windows, and open doors as seen in this bright and airy, sun-filled room.</p>\n",
