This drawing, given to the museum by the artist in the 1960s, is one of many studies for the Art Institute\u2019s painting <em>The Rock</em> (1956.338). Taken as a group, the studies for the painting demonstrate the artist\u2019s working method and show the progression of <em>The Rock</em> from an idea to the finished painting.</p>\n",
