    "description": "<p>The scene portrays the visit of the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary to announce to her that she woulbe be the mother of God. The piece is unusual in that the piece is in fine condition and is unaltered and still retains its original borders. The very detailed design motif with architectural elements of the canopy and prie dieu are typical of the period. The centrally placed lily in a vase between the Virgin and the announcing angel represents purity; because of its depiction in many Annumciation scenes, the lily has become the flower of the Virgin and an attribute of the Archangel Gabriel. Mary appears to have been interrupted in prayer by the angel, carrying the scepter as herald of God. The dove at the upper right, is symbolic of the Holy Spirit. The panel is worked in a technique generally known as lacis, utilizing a ground of square netting which is subsequently embroidered with cloth and/or darning stitches. Lacis, or netting, is the oldest of the techniques of lace making, evolving from fishing nets and animal snares. Intended for ecclesiastical use, such as for alter frontals, funeral palls, hangings, and a variety of other liturical linens, were ornamented with sacred emblems or symbolic figures. This panel may have been a section from a much-larger alter frontal or hanging, or it may have been a separate picture. It is an excellent example of lacis work.</p>\n",
