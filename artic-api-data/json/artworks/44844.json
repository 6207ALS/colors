    "description": "<p>As early as high school, DeWain Valentine could be found testing the potential of fiberglass in his family\u2019s oven, drawn to the project of shaping, refining, and polishing forms. Later inspired to move to Los Angeles by the work of fellow Finish Fetish artists, he taught a course on plastics at UCLA and collaborated with a chemical engineer to develop a method of casting large solid volumes in polyester resin. Valentine prized a pristine surface, and though his sculptures are heavy, they appear elegantly balanced, even weightless. Richly colored resin works like <em>Ring, Gray Violet</em> seem both to absorb and to radiate light, inviting us into what the artist calls the sculpture\u2019s \u201ctransparent colored space.\u201d</p>\n",
