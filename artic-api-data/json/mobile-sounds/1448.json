    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Madhuvanti Ghose spoke in the galleries about this twelfth century granite Buddha from the south of India.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE:  This particular Buddha is shown seated in the lotus meditational posture with his hands resting in his lap. There are certain human beings in India who are marked from birth by tattoo [ph?] signs or lakshana\u2019s. And the Buddha here has the urna which is a mark on his forehead between his brows which is like the spot of the third eye. He also is marked by the wheel of the law on the palm of his hands. And you see the energies that are being exuded from the Buddha emerging from the top of his head where you see these flames which, in fact, to a certain extent cover his ushnisha or cranial protuberance which is another symbol that marks him out to a special human being, a supernatural human being. If you care to look behind this gigantic sculpture you can see that there are some marks of an ancient inscription in the language of South India Tamil. But, in fact, it is so degraded now that we can\u2019t read it.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This Buddha was produced under the Chola empire which spread its cultural influence through conquests in India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The Chola rulers, in fact, were Hindu. But they allowed Buddhism and Jainism to flourish in their vast dominions along with other faiths.&quot;</p>\n",
