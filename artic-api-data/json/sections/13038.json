American enthusiasm for such silver began around 1920, when new forms in metal from Denmark and Sweden offered an aesthetic alternative to a market flooded with Colonial Revival designs. A Jewelers\u2019 Weekly article from 1920 referred to Danish silver, in particular, as \u201ca breeze of fresh air,\u201d marking \u201ca change from [silver ware] usually seen by Americans.\u201d Between 1926 and 1938, imports of sterling silver from Denmark nearly tripled, and American firms turned to Scandinavian designers to invigorate their lines of silver ware (see cat. 85). The simple forms, smooth contours, and naturalistic ornamentation that epitomized Scandinavian metalwork aligned with the Americanpenchant for modernism, providing an alternative to the geometry and exaggeration of French Art Moderne. Danish silversmith Georg Jensen, for example, who opened his first U.S. showroom in New York in 1922, became a household name for his blend of modern and traditional elements in flatware and hollowware.\n\nExhibitions of Danish and Swedish decorative arts fueled the American appetite for Scandinavian silver. These included Decorative Metalwork and Cotton Textiles, which was organized by the American Federation of Arts and traveled to Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Chicago in 1930\u201331; the large display of Swedish arts and crafts presented at the Century of Progress International Exposition in Chicago in 1933; and the presentation of Jensen\u2019s silver at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939. In a review of developments in modern silver on view at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Danish and Swedish works were praised as \u201cthe only modern silver that seemed to succeed in being modern\u201d while also retaining \u201csomething of the flowing graciousness that the metal silver naturally has as its birthright.\u201d\n\nPeer Smed was uniquely positioned to capitalize on the craze for Scandinavian design in America. It has been suggested that the Danish-born Smed learned blacksmithing from his father before becoming a silversmith. At fourteen he began an apprenticeship with the court silversmith of Copenhagen, A. Michelson, and was also associated with Jensen\u2019s silver firm in the same city. Smed, who was described as a \u201ctall, robust Viking-type of man with an enormous head of hair and a long reddish beard,\u201d moved to New York in 1903. While little is known of his life and work prior to the 1930s, there are accounts of decorative iron- and copperwork he executed for private and commercial spaces as well as a series of sculptural busts he made in copper. As a Danish-trained silversmith living and working in the New York area amid the vogue for Scandinavian design, Smed\u2019s profile grew. Unlike other \u00e9migr\u00e9s such as Erik Magnussen (see cat. 85), who experimented with more stylized, geometric permutations of modernism, Smed remained grounded in the tenets of Jensen\u2019s aesthetic: organic forms and lustrous surfaces punctuated by beads, buds, and scrolling natural ornamentation. He disavowed machine manufacture, relying completely on the hand-raising and hand-finishing techniques he learned in his native country.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s compote bears the vegetal motifs for which Smed was known. A wide-rimmed, undulating cup sits atop a stem shaped like a ripened peapod, supported by four delicate leaves that hug the smooth contours of the vessel. Smed\u2019s use of high relief in his articulation of the leaves and the peas adds a lifelike quality to the object, hinting at the craftsman\u2019s early work in sculpture in much the same way as a group of zoomorphic cocktail shakers executed in 1931 (see fig. 1). The rich surface of the compote is hand hammered and relatively unadorned, enhanced at intermittent points by delicate beading along the rim of the compote and the four flared design elements on the domed foot. Foliate motifs also appear in the Art Institute\u2019s pair of candelebra fashioned in 1934, which are rendered with the same modernist restraint. The stalklike arms of each triple- branch candelabrum grow from a central, spherical form that rests upon a short, elegantly chased shaft. As on the compote, beading is used to finely accent the base of each candelabrum and the opening of the floral, wax-catching bobeches around the candle nozzles. In a review of Smed\u2019s work in the New York Sun, a critic described the \u201clush abundant curves and hearty graciousness\u201d as \u201crecall[ing] the work of the late Jensen\u201d but with \u201cits own individuality.\u201d The overall effect is one of metal come to life.\n\nWhile Smed never enjoyed the international acclaim that his countryman Jensen did, an undated advertisement sang of his robust studio practice:\n\nDaily and in added numbers connoisseurs of beauty are beating a pathway to the door of Peer Smed\u2019s studio. Here in an atmosphere of old world charm a master-smith designs and fashions silver of exquisite loveliness. From delicate earring to elaborate dinner service\u2014chaste and beautiful\u2014every piece takes form under his skilled manipulation. Every unit reflects the creative, inspired genius of a man devoted to his artistry. If you, too, are weary of conventional, machine-made products, Peer Smed\u2019s hand-wrought silverware holds much that charms.\n\nSmed\u2019s work was also singled out as exemplary of the advances made in American silver, not \u201cover-adorned\u201d but giving the \u201cimpression of luxury and a certain elegance.\u201d Indeed, objects such as this compote and candlesticks stand as testaments to the pervasive influence of Scandinavian design in America and the beautiful and utilitarian objects produced in this vein in the first half of the twentieth century.  \nElizabeth McGoey\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Venable (1995), p. 277.\n\nStern, Tucker, and Venable (2005), p. 142.\n\nFor more information on Jensen, see Drucker (1997).\n\nStern, Tucker, and Venable (2005), p. 142.\n\nBoykin (1937), p. 10.\n\nMay (1947), p. 278.\n\nHowe (1913), p. 405.
