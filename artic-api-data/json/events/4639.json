    "description": "<p>In the 1930s, as the United States was struggling through the Great Depression, a rising interest in early American vernacular arts\u2014collectively referred to as folk art\u2014converged with major documentary photographic projects. As artists, curators, collectors, and government administrators sought to define American culture as distinct from Europe, they identified in these two burgeoning fields a national culture they considered egalitarian, unpretentious, and self-made.</p><p>Curators Elizabeth McGoey and Elizabeth Siegel take you on a tour of <a href=\"/exhibitions/9202/photography-folk-art-looking-for-america-in-the-1930s\" target=\"_blank\"><em>PHOTOGRAPHY + FOLK ART: Looking for America in the 1930s</em></a>, an exhibition that combines photography and early American folk art in an unexpected way that is the first of its kind.</p><p><strong>Space is limited and participation is first-come, first-served.</strong></p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the image on this page is for reference purposes only and may not be featured during the gallery talk.</p>",
