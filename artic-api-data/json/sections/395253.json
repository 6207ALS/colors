She gave it the title Miss Seton in Hat / Seated, which links it to another untransferred drawing that she titled Miss Seton Seated in Chair (cat. 171). Both images remained unprocessed until November 1903, when Goulding transferred them to stone and printed posthumous editions of each.\n\nIt has traditionally been assumed that Birnie Philip\u2019s reference was to Dorothy Seton, a young, red-haired Irish woman who modeled for at least two oil paintings by Whistler in the period between October 1902 and May 1903. It is doubtful, however, that she was the model for the two transfer lithographs, which were probably drawn in Paris in early January 1897. There is no reason to think that Dorothy Seton was modeling for Whistler as early as 1897, nor is it likely that she worked for him in Paris. Moreover, the two portraits do not necessarily depict the same sitter.\n\nIt is clear, however, that they were drawn at the same time. Both were sketched on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, the transparent French transfer paper that Whistler generally used when working on lithographs in Paris. This thin paper readily picked up the texture of whatever material was used beneath it as a drawing surface. In creating these two images, Whistler utilized a surface with a distinct pattern of parallel lines spaced almost 5 mm apart. Both lithographs reproduce this texture; in the present image five lines appear to the left of the sitter\u2019s skirt, while in Portrait of a Young Woman (cat. 171) the same pattern is visible in the area to the right of the chair. Neither image resembles lithographs that Whistler had drawn previously in the studio using professional models. Rather, both are much closer in feeling to the portraits he drew of his late wife\u2019s family in 1896 and 1897. It is possible that Portrait of a Young Woman Wearing a Hat might picture Whistler\u2019s sister-in-law, Ethel Whibley, who often posed for his lithographs wearing elaborate hats and visiting clothes (see, for example, cat. 34, cat. 35, cat. 178, and cat. 179). Alternatively, the sitter may have been an acquaintance who called on the family at the house on the rue du Bac. The frontal pose and attention to articles of dress recall earlier portrait lithographs drawn during social calls, such as La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99) and A Portrait: Mildred Howells (cat. 112), but these 1894 works do not exhibit the distinctive surface texture and pattern of parallel lines that characterize cat. 171 and cat. 172.\n\nChicago: SC, off-white laid paper (265 \u00d7 209 mm).
