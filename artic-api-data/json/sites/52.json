    "description": "Edward Hopper (1882\u20131967), creator of art that novelist John Updike described as \"calm, silent, stoic, luminous, and classic,\" is one of the most enduring and popular American painters of the 20th century. A pivotal artist who was intensely private, Hopper made solitude and introspection important themes in his paintings, which have been celebrated as a part of the very grain and texture of the American experience.",
