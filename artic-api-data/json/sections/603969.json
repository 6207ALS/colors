Robinson, 1949.457\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent light-green glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rim, rounded by reheating, flares out from a long, cylindrical neck that spreads out gently into a large, piriform body. The wall bends into a tooled base ring with a flat, slightly kicked base with a pontil mark. A very thin trail highlights the lower part of the neck just before it begins to spread out into the body. For a zoomable image, see fig. 120.1.\n\nThe neck is broken and repaired. The interior below the repair still retains a thick, dark weathering product that appears as silvery iridescence when viewed through the vessel wall. The weathering crust on the bottle exterior has been almost completely removed and the resulting surface is slightly iridescent.\n\nThis is an elegant, simple form that has many variations. The surface currently reads as if one was looking at a mirror through the vessel wall. Compare the silver iridescence on the interior of this flask to the golden iridescence on the exterior of an earlier bottle in the Art Institute of Chicago (cat. 119).\n\nThere are no simple bottles that preserve this particular elegant ovoid form. A bottle in the National Museums Scotland has an equally elegant but slightly different profile. A related bottle with a somewhat more full, swelling body was found in Roman Amphipolis dated to the second half of the second or third century A.D. There are several bottles in the Princeton University Art Museum that have related profiles.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Lightfoot, Ancient Glass in National Museums Scotland, p. 97, no. 226.\n\nMalama and Darakia, \u201cDie Kunst der Glasherstellung in Amphipolis,\u201d p. 163, fig. 13.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, pp. 146\u201347, nos. 202 and 204.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 120 Bottle, 3rd/4th century A.D.\n\nfig. 120.1 Bottle (3rd/4th century A.D.).
