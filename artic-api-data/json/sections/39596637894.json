Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at two distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of several working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis hand-colored impression of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) is among those printed in a later phase of compositional development for which the artist adhered two sheets of absorbent Japanese paper together to obtain a surface that accommodated applications of transparent watercolor brushed over printing ink. It is very similar in palette and execution to impressions of Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.2), Te po (The Night) (cat. 52.1), and L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54.2) in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. Overall, the hand-colored impressions have a more luminous quality that is enhanced by the translucency of the Japanese papers. And it is this very quality that likely appealed to Gauguin when he worked with delicate washes of color. The end results are certainly aesthetically quite different from those impressions in which transferred media predominate. By comparison, impressions colored by the transfer of waxy, resinous media were instead printed on much sturdier papers.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 55.2.2).\n\nThe wood block was printed twice, first in brown ink and then in carbon black ink (see fig. 55.2.3 and fig. 55.2.4). The brown ink is a mixture of carbon black, vermilion, and chrome orange. Once printed, Gauguin brush applied watercolors to tone various passages and set them apart from each other. Viridian green predominates in the foreground. Ultramarine blue was used in the contour of the idol\u2019s arm and back and pale washes of blue watercolor enhance the idol\u2019s form. Bright yellow, possibly gamboge, was used to highlight the roof line of the hut in the distance (fig. 55.2.5); under ultraviolet light the touches of yellow in the hut appear black. Barely discernible passages of pink that appear in the distant sky in the upper left are a much-faded cochineal lake. Faint passages of dilute cobalt blue with some ultramarine appear in same area as well. This sky was once awash in pink that blended into blue, hinting that the time of day of the scene could have been sunset or sunrise (fig. 55.2.6; see also cat. 56.1). Pale yellow in the palm tree fluoresces pale orange, hinting that touches of vermilion were once present. Yet, the most intriguing tonal passages are those where cadmium yellow degraded and is no longer visible due to fading and alteration of the pigment over time (fig. 55.2.7). This yellow tone surrounded the idol; today, however, the golden-brown passages that remain of the degraded pigment can easily be mistaken for staining. When the print is compared to Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Mata mua (In Olden Times), a better sense of the chromatic arrangement originally intended by the artist is readily apparent (fig. 55.2.8). Examination of the verso reveals a bit more of the original unfaded colors (fig. 55.2.1). A digital recolorization of the faded pigments allows the reader to envision Gauguin\u2019s watercolor palette by suggesting how the print might have originally looked (fig. 55.2.9).\n\nGauguin adhered two sheets of thin Japanese paper together to make this laminate. A thinner wove paper lies above a slightly heavier laid paper; this same order of lamination was repeated in the Art Institute\u2019s hand-colored impression of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (cat. 54.2). Gauguin selected fibrous ivory- and cream-toned papers for this and a number of other hand-colored impressions, but not without modifying the paper in some way. Often Gauguin would laminate together two distinctly different Japanese papers, one laid and the other wove. Fine vertical creases are visible in all of the laminated sheets examined for this study. The creases formed as a result of sheet expansion and manipulation as the artist wetted the papers and perhaps brush applied a dilute, water-soluble adhesive (possibly starch-based) onto the sheets to adhere them to each other. In this laminate, there is barely any adhesion between the two paper layers, and it is possible that Gauguin relied upon the pressure he exerted upon the sheets before or during printing rather than the adhesive itself to assure adhesion.<sup></sup> The significant pressure used in printing helped to adhere the sheets together while also impressing the creases into the laminate.\n\nWhen examined in transmitted light it can be determined that the chain line interval found in the laid paper bottom sheet runs vertically and is 35 mm wide with one irregular interval of 32 mm in the center of the sheet. Two additional hand-colored impressions on laminated sheets, L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 and Te po, can be found in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. In L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 and Maruru, the laid paper is pasted beneath the wove paper, while in Te po it is the reverse; in all cases, the overall visual effect is the same. The chain line intervals in all three prints are identical\u2014all are 35 mm wide, with the exception of one in the center or on the right side of the sheet, which is 32 mm wide. Visually the papers are all nearly identical to each other when weight, color, and surface texture are compared. However, in Te po the wove paper used as the underlying sheet is of a lighter weight and tone than the wove paper used in these other impressions.\n\n204 \u00d7 355 mm (image); 207 \u00d7 358 mm (sheets)\n\nThis impression appears to be a unique second-state impression in which additional work on the block takes the form of fine engraved lines in many areas. These appear in the standing form to the right of the idol where a series of vertical lines are added to her shirt; in the third state these lines will be omitted and instead more emphatic lines will be added along the idol\u2019s back. A series of fine curved lines also appear to the right of the tree behind the idol and within the form itself, and in the base upon which the idol sits numerous fine lines delineate decorative forms. As Gauguin continued to carve into the block, these fine engraved lines were replaced with more emphatic and more deeply gouged strokes.\n\nGauguin created this impression of Maruru in several steps. First, he inked the wood block in brown, rolling out a thin, somewhat uneven layer of ink over the surface with darker passages in the lower right and along the vertical edges. He used a soft roller to do this so that a bit of the brown ink would lightly fill some of the more deeply gouged passages, namely, those in the distant sky to the left and in the treelike form to the right of the idol. He then selectively wiped away some of the brown ink in a horizontal band through the center of the composition in anticipation of printing a blacker passage there.\n\nGauguin then lightly inked the block in black. He did so in two uneven passes of the roller. Moving across the block from right to left, there is a pronounced vertical line of black printing ink approximately 12 mm in from the right edge\u2014this marks the spot where Gauguin set the roller back down on the block for his second pass. A darker band of black ink is visible along the top edge and extends into the composition about 20 mm. As the artist pushed the roller farther across the block, the black band diminished, as did the intensity of the black ink. Where brown ink was removed in the first printing, black ink from the second printing visually predominates. There is also one small vertical band of brown ink visible to the right of the palm tree where no black ink is present, perhaps inadvertently skipped in the printing process. Overall, the block was deliberately not brought up to color in either ink so that the artist could create a hazy, atmospheric effect by exploiting the fibrous quality of the Japanese paper to its full advantage. This, combined with Gauguin\u2019s preference to skew his printings (here the black printing skewed to the left by only 1 mm), results in a deliberately blurred image.\n\nHand-colored impressions of Noa Noa (cat. 51.2), Te po (cat. 52.1), and L\u2019universe est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (cat. 54.2) and this impression of Maruru bear a striking similarity to one other. All are toned in similar fashion using the same watercolor palette (with colors that have identical fading characteristics) on Japanese papers that were well suited to the application of the translucent aqueous medium. Gauguin clearly limited the use of these Japanese-paper laminates to his hand-colored impressions. Impressions colored by the transfer of media were instead printed on slightly heavier, well-sized papers.\n\nIn a 1988 condition report it was noted that the laminated papers had separated significantly on the sides and bottom. To conserve the work, the papers were separated in their entirety and discoloration was reduced in each sheet. Following treatment, the two sheets were reunited. As a result of treatment, creases in the secondary support were removed while those in the primary support were diminished. In the reunited sheet there is more adhesion between the two paper layers than in the sheets laminated by the artist.\n\nAs a result of conservation treatment, the work is in sound, stable condition.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF, Raman microspectroscopy and SERS analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe fading that is visible in the pink and blue washes in this print are very similar to the faded pink washes in the foreground and sky, and to the faded blue washes in the sky of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56.1).\n\nFor an analysis of Henri Matisse\u2019s work where a similar degradation of cadmium yellow was studied, see E. Pouyet et al., \u201c2D X-ray and FTIR micro-analysis of the degradation of cadmium yellow pigment in paintings of Henri Matisse,\u201d Applied Physics A 121, no. 3 (June 3, 2015), pp. 967\u201380, doi: 10.1007/s00339-015-9239-4.\n\nI am very grateful to Mary Broadway, Andrew W. Mellon Fellow in Paper Conservation at the Art Institute, for creating this recolorization. Our firsthand examination of the artist\u2019s manuscript, Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, provided us with a better visual understanding of the original vibrancy of the artist\u2019s watercolor palette. Works within the manuscript were visually compared to select works that bore close tonal similarities to the Chicago sheet. Broadway used these works to simulate what the original appearance of the Chicago sheet may have looked like. See Paul Gauguin (French, 1848\u20131902), Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, 1893\u20131901, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, given by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, 1927, Paris, RF 7259.\n\nGiven that the two paper layers separate so easily, it is possible that the artist did not use any adhesive at all. Instead, he could have taken the two sheets, dampened them, and simply pounded and pressed them together to achieve adhesion between them. The long Japanese paper fibers would have responded readily to this manner of adhesion.\n\nNote that papers formed on traditional paper molds of Eastern origin often do not display pronounced laid line patterns from which frequencies can be readily measured, as is the case here.\n\nDavid Chandler, condition report and treatment record, 1988, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. To reunite the sheets dilute wheat starch paste was used. This differs from the artist\u2019s method in which it appears that he did not use adhesive.\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
