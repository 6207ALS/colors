    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This pile of candy is an untitled work by Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Curator James Rondeau:</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: This work is actually a portrait. The amount of candy here, 175 pounds, is equivalent to the body weight of Felix's partner, Ross Laycock-- Ross's ideal body weight at perfect health. He was suffering from HIV and ultimately died of AIDS.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Feel free to take a piece of candy. Your doing so is part of this piece.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: The activity surrounding the work mimics Ross's illness. The amount of candy in the pile diminishes in a way that parallels Ross's own weight loss while he was ill. So the work is actually very much a double-edged sword. In one sense, there's a very sweet and sincere and easy gesture of generosity. On the other hand, we're encountered not only to take a piece of candy, but to metaphorically reduce a symbol for Ross Laycock's own body as the disease reduced him. As in so many works by this artist, the joy and the celebration and the beauty inherent in his works of art are tinged with melancholy and sadness. Gonzalez-Torres stipulated that the pile should be continuously replenished, thus granting perpetual life to a work that memorializes a lost loved one.</p>\n",
