(August 1993) / 1/7 Joel Sternfeld\"; unmarked verso\n\n\nKaren Silkwood, a worker at the Cimarron River Plutonium Plant, had gathered potentially incriminating evidence about the falsification of quality-control documents. On November 13, 1974, on her way to a meeting with a New York Times reporter, Silkwood\u2019s car skidded off Highway 74 killing her instantly. When friends arrived at the scene shortly after the crash, the manila folder she had intended to give the Times reporter was missing. \n\nThe Oklahoma State Police determined that Silkwood, under the influence of barbiturates, had fallen asleep at the wheel. Independent investigators concluded that Silkwood had been forced off the road by another vehicle.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
