Matisse / 4/44 (lower right, in pen and black ink)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Shapiro, 1992.252\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Extending his pen-and-ink lines right up to the edges of the ivory wove paper, Henri Matisse drew the composition directly, with no preliminary sketch. He chose as his support a versatile artist\u2019s paper manufactured for both watercolor and drawing and drew on the smoother side of the paper, which was specifically intended for line (trait) drawing. Pale, dry ink lines occurring throughout indicate Matisse drew until his pen ran out of ink before dipping it and resuming (see fig. 52.1). There are pinholes at the four corners, likely indicating that he tacked the paper to a board while he drew.\n\nSigned and dated: H. Matisse / 4/44 (lower right, in pen and black ink) (fig. 52.2).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. The ink is glossy, indicating the presence of a resinous binder. The gloss is accentuated when viewed at an angle.\n\nThe support is thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The top and bottom have a deckle edge. The right and left edges are straight cut. Colored fibers and inclusions are visible in the ivory fiber matrix at magnification 2\u00d7. For an image of the verso, see fig. 52.3.\n\nThe sheet bears an impressed watermarked across the top edge: LAVIS J PERRIGOT ARCHES SPECIAL MBM (FRANCE) TRAIT (see fig. 52.4, fig. 52.5, fig. 52.6, and fig. 52.7). This versatile artist\u2019s paper was manufactured for watercolor and drawing. Lavis (wash) and trait appear on opposite sides of the sheet and indicate the intended use. Lavis can be read from the rough side of the paper, which is suited to watercolor and wash drawings. Trait can be read from the smoother side of the sheet, which is suited to line drawing and that Matisse chose for this pen-and-ink work. The watermark is impressed into the smoother side of the sheet (recto).\n\n56.3 \u00d7 76.4 cm (22 \u00d7 30 in.).\n\nThe drawing underwent conservation treatment in 2015 to reduce surface soil and adhesive accretions along the perimeter of the recto.\n\nThe paper has a pale-brown mat-burn stain along the perimeter. There are faint yellow stains near the lower left corner. There is scattered surface soil on both the recto and verso. In raking light, the sheet shows minor dents across the surface.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Joseph Randall Shapiro (Dec. 22, 1904\u2013June 16, 1996) and Jory Shapiro (1911\u20131993), Chicago, by Feb. 8, 1959\u2013June 25, 1992.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 25, 1992.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">South Bend, Ind., Art Gallery of the University of Notre Dame, Modern Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Collages: Loaned from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro, Feb. 8\u2013Mar. 8, 1959, cat. 70, as Woman at Table, 1944.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Treasures of Chicago Collectors, Apr. 15\u2013May 7, 1961, no cat no., as Woman at a Table, 1944.\n\nChicago, Museum of Contemporary Art, Selections from the Joseph Randall Shapiro Collection, Dec. 20, 1969\u2013Feb. 1, 1970, cat. 110 (ill.), as Girl at a Table, 1944.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, The Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro Collection, Feb. 23\u2013Apr. 14, 1985, cat. 106 (ill.), as Girl at a Table, April 1944.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, An Irrational Act: Gifts of Surrealist Works on Paper from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro, Dec. 15, 1992\u2013Apr. 18, 1993, not in cat.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Art Gallery of the University of Notre Dame, Modern Master Drawings, Watercolors, and Collages: Loaned from the Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Randall Shapiro, exh. cat.
