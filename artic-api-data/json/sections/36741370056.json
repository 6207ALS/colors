The theme is one of a range of domestic genre subjects\u2014also including the governess or servant and child, getting dressed, and playing games\u2014that were carried over into the nineteenth century from past art and given a new sense of contemporaneity and psychological insight by the Realists and the Impressionists. In her biography of the artist, Jeanne Baudot (a student of Renoir\u2019s from 1893 to 1895) reported on a visit to the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre with her mentor: \u201cHe particularly liked [Gerard] Terborch and [Pieter] de Hooch, but his favorite was the Lacemaker by Vermeer.\u201d This small oil painting (fig. 7.1) entered the collection of the Louvre in 1870. In Vermeer\u2019s novel treatment of natural light, representation of ephemeral moments of everyday life, and sensitivity to male and female spheres of experience, Renoir found a precedent for his own Impressionist enterprise.\n\nThe artist\u2019s earliest representation of needlework, Lise Sewing (fig. 7.2 [Daulte 16; Dauberville 396]), portrays his mistress Lise Tr\u00e9hot, who modeled for him frequently from 1866 until 1872. In other paintings, Lise played the role of sultry odalisque or nude bather, but here she is represented simply as herself, dressed in modest but elegant attire that is ambiguous as to class. There are signs of staged domesticity in this portrayal. Though unmarried, she wears a wedding ring, and her jeweled earrings with their distinctive teardrop stones may well have been studio props\u2014they reappeared two years later on Lise in Woman in a Garden (1868; Kunstmuseum Basel [Daulte 83; Dauberville 286]). It is worth noting that the figure in Young Woman Sewing also wears teardrop earrings, but the lack of detail makes it difficult to tell whether they are of the same design.\n\nThe splendor of the asters and chrysanthemums arranged in a shimmering vase, possibly of glazed ceramic, has led Gloria Groom and Douglas Druick to conclude that Young Woman Sewing was painted late in the summer of 1879 during the final days of Renoir\u2019s first stay at the Ch\u00e2teau de Wargemont, the Normandy home of his patron Paul Berard. It seems unlikely, however, that the artist would have executed such a large and stunningly provocative color work of an anonymous young woman when his commissioned portraits of the Berard family and staff members are conservatively composed and set against conventional dark backgrounds. Rather, the possibility should be entertained that Young Woman Sewing was executed after Renoir\u2019s return to Paris in late September, where he could have acquired the flowers from one of the many Montmartre flower vendors.\n\nThe most remarkable aspect of Young Woman Sewing is the way Renoir was able to energize the traditionally subdued indoor subject with a brilliant flourish of natural light and a profusion of color in the bouquet. His Realist and Impressionist predecessors may have influenced this bold juxtaposition. For example, Gustave Courbet linked women and flowers in The Trellis (fig. 7.3), in which floral bounty verges on the fantastic and makes allegorical allusion to youth and love. Flowers also abound in Edgar Degas\u2019s A Woman Seated beside a Vase of Flowers (fig. 7.4) to such an extent that the off-center figure appears to be a late addition, though this is probably not the case. Rather, Degas seized the opportunity to be visually innovative with the subject. The seemingly informal arrangement of blossoms in Young Woman Sewing dominates the composition less than the flowers in the works by Courbet and Degas, but the abundance of variety and texture allowed Renoir a certain freedom in handling that amply demonstrates his technical skill.\n\nNo attempt has been made to identify Renoir\u2019s beautiful young model with her round face, plump lips, and reddish hair. The artist lost his regular model, Alma-Henriette Leboeuf, called Margot, to smallpox in February 1879 and would have needed another Montmartre resident he could call on for figure paintings. Three additional models posed for Renoir in 1879 and 1880: Ellen Andr\u00e9e, an aspiring actress; Ang\u00e8le, a young florist in Montmartre whose last name is not known; and Aline Charigot, Renoir\u2019s future wife. Both Andr\u00e9e and Charigot had red hair and can be seen in Luncheon of the Boating Party (fig. 7.5 [Daulte 379; Dauberville 224]). Ang\u00e8le, who appears in Sleeping Girl with a Cat (1880; Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Mass. [Daulte 330; Dauberville 487]), had darker hair and somewhat slimmer facial features.\n\nThough little is known of Aline\u2019s early years in Montmartre or exactly when she met Renoir, it is likely that she had begun modeling for him by the fall of 1879. She was then twenty years old and working as a seamstress, and thus part of a milieu with which Renoir was already acquainted. According to her son Jean Renoir, at the time Aline lived with her mother on rue Saint-Georges, the street on which Renoir\u2019s studio was located. By 1880 Renoir and Aline seem to have been on intimate terms. That summer he paid her board at the Maison Fournaise in Chatou, where she modeled for Luncheon of the Boating Party after Renoir arrived from Normandy in September. If Aline was the model for Young Woman Sewing, the difference between the tranquil concentration and demure costume of the figure in that painting and the coquettish, fashionably dressed canoti\u00e8re (rower) playing with her dog in Luncheon of the Boating Party could reflect Aline\u2019s change in status from occasional model under the watchful eye of her mother to \u201cmy dear friend,\u201d as Renoir addressed her in correspondence after their relationship began. In the fall of 1881, Aline accompanied Renoir to Italy. Most scholars agree that, while the couple was in Capri, she modeled for Blonde Bather (fig. 7.6 [Daulte 387; Dauberville 583]). No photographs of Aline from this period of her relationship with Renoir have yet come to light, but there is a compelling resemblance between the figures in Young Woman Sewing and Blonde Bather. Despite the title of the Italian work, there is some red in the woman\u2019s hair, a strawberry-blonde color shared with the figure in Young Woman Sewing. In addition, the two have similar features, including rosy cheeks, wide-set eyes, and prominent noses.\n\nIt may never be possible to confidently identify Renoir\u2019s model, but Aline\u2019s occupation as a seamstress would have lent additional significance to the artist\u2019s choosing her as a model for this subject. This painting is usually referred to as Young Woman Sewing, or La couseuse, but an early handwritten label from a previous backing or stretcher reads Femme brodant et fleurs (Woman embroidering and flowers; fig. 7.7) and almost certainly dates to the period when Charles Deudon owned the painting, prior to his death in 1914. The brightly colored fabric that the figure holds in her hand suggests that she may be embroidering a pattern on white cloth. The distinction between sewing and embroidery is significant. Repairs to clothing and other fabrics were carried out by domestics or hired out to seamstresses, and undoubtedly Aline undertook such work. Decorative embroidery, however, was reserved for the middle and upper classes and was performed primarily on domestic linens, such as antimacassars and slipcovers, and clothing.\n\nEmbroidery acquired even greater status in the late nineteenth century as a form of craft, especially for artists such as Renoir. In 1884, he included embroiderers in his prospectus for a \u201cSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Irr\u00e9gularistes,\u201d whose members would also be drawn from the ranks of architects, goldsmiths, and decorators\u2014all professions that shared a belief in the importance of the arts in everyday life. As Gloria Groom has suggested, acknowledging that embroidery was recognized as a craft enriches our understanding of Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s painting of his very haute bourgeoise mother stitching a patterned cloth (1877; private collection). The portrait was shown at the third Impressionist exhibition in April 1877. In July of that year, Caillebotte, Renoir, and the art dealer Alphonse Legrand were collaborators in a business venture to paint decoration on a fine white plaster cement, used to make faux marbre. Though it dissolved in April 1878, the enterprise was indicative of how strongly both Caillebotte and Renoir felt about Impressionism\u2019s involvement in the decorative arts.\n\nYoung Woman Sewing is a vibrant, light-filled canvas in which Renoir exploited the expressive potential of color with a surprising freedom of handling. Cobalt blue dominates the deep shadows of the legged vase and the body of the commode and is present as well in blended glazes in the background and in the young woman\u2019s costume. The blue makes a striking contrast against the red surface on which the vase sits. Touches of blue applied with a fine-tip brush appear throughout the hair, flesh, comb, and eyelashes (fig. 7.8). Shades of both red and blue run through the woman\u2019s clothing, either applied with long strokes of a fine-tip brush or blended over existing underlayers, and merge into violet in the shadows (fig. 7.9), a velvety Impressionist equivalent of traditional chiaroscuro. With a more sparing use of yellows in the flowers, hair, flesh, and subtle highlights around the vase, Renoir managed to convey middle tones and a convincing verisimilitude through the optical mixing of primary colors (fig. 7.10).\n\nThe innovative exploration of color in Young Woman Sewing is evident when the painting is viewed in the context of Renoir\u2019s more conservative portrait painting or compared to a work such as Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children (fig. 7.11 [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]), which was exhibited at the Salon of 1879. Renoir clearly considered black an important color and fully understood its aesthetic potential, as indicated by his virtuoso representation of the richly detailed black silk of the luxurious couture dress seen in this painting. By contrast, the dominance of primary hues, especially blue, in Young Woman Sewing makes it the figural equivalent of the stormy Seascape (fig. 7.12 [cat. 8]). The artist established comparable textural patterns in both paintings by juxtaposing areas of translucent color washes with areas of minimally worked impasto. Using the same basic palette, however, Renoir evoked very different moods in the two paintings by varying the representation of light.\n\nThe light source in Young Woman Sewing is as ambiguous as that in Vermeer\u2019s Lace Maker. In both paintings, it is presumably a window just outside the space of the picture. The vagueness of the source gave Vermeer latitude to bathe his image in light, giving it a mystical quality. The light in Renoir\u2019s painting can be said to be as much the subject of the piece as the figure\u2019s attentive work with the needle. She radiates warmth, and her features shine with reflected light. The inside of her collar and the top of her head are rendered in pure white, contributing to the intense luminosity of the picture. Even shaded areas away from the light source seem to glow, particularly the figure\u2019s hair (see Palette in the technical report), with its reddish-orange tones (fig. 7.13). Renoir was able to achieve such dazzling effects by using very thin glazes over a thick white ground.\n\nCritics who knew the Impressionists and supported their agenda in the press recognized the fundamental role of color in the group\u2019s work. On the occasion of the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, Edmond Duranty wrote a pamphlet titled The New Painting, which provided a justification for the kinds of issues Renoir sought to address in Young Woman Sewing: \u201cProceeding from intuition to intuition, they have little by little succeeded in breaking down sunlight into its rays, its elements, and [in] reconstituting its unity by means of the general harmony of spectrum colors\u2014which they spread on their canvases.\u201d Young Woman Sewing holds an important place in Renoir\u2019s oeuvre not only by virtue of its subject matter, drawn from the Old Masters, but also because it reveals Renoir forging his independence as a modern colorist even as he sought greater commercial success at the Salon.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir executed this painting on a fine-weave, standard-size canvas with a thick, white, commercially applied ground that fills the weave, appears systematically textured with diagonal strokes, and extends to the edges of the tacking margins. The X-ray shows a large vertical form left of center that does not correspond to any visible element in the painting; it seems to be an artifact of an imperfectly applied ground layer.\n\nIn most of the composition, Renoir layered thin veils of paint in glaze- and semiglaze-like layers in order to make use of the reflective qualities of the ground. To achieve this translucency, he alternately thinned and added fluid medium to his paint and used translucent pigments like red lake and cobalt blue. Some parts of the background and figure are so thin that they do not register in the X-ray, in contrast with the thicker, heavily textured application of paint in the flowers on the upper right. The artist appears to have made few compositional changes to the work, perhaps only lowering the profile of the woman\u2019s right shoulder. The slightly shaded look of the area immediately to the right of the figure may also indicate changes to either the figure or the background that Renoir subsequently wiped away with a cloth, leaving a thin residue behind. In the foreground, the artist employed wiping as a painting technique; the remnants of paint left in the depressions of the textured ground create shadow and give the gathered fabric in the woman\u2019s hand a soft edge. Toward the end of the process, Renoir firmly established the light source on the upper right with heavy white highlights on the vase and flowers, and in the comb in the figure\u2019s hair.\n\nThe work has a synthetic varnish that imparts some saturation and gloss. The current varnish replaced an oil-resin varnish, but it is unknown whether that was original to the painting.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 7.14).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. 79. (upper left, in blue paint).\n\nThe signature was painted wet-in-wet with the upper layers of the background and picks up some of the surrounding red lake through the center. The n appears to have been reinforced by the artist during the process (fig. 7.15, fig. 7.16).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were 61.1 \u00d7 50.2 cm, according to 1969 pretreatment measurements. An early exhibition label preserved from the original stretcher lists the painting as 61 \u00d7 50 cm (fig. 7.17), and a possibly related published exhibition record from 1922 lists the same measurements. This probably corresponds to a no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size (60 \u00d7 50 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 29.8V (0.5) \u00d7 24.9H (1.2) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThere is very mild cusping corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. The canvas is also marked by numerous nubs and imperfections.\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1969, the original dimensions were slightly increased on all sides (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 4.5\u20136.5 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with horizontal crossbar. Depth: Approximately 1.5 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: verso of original canvas (covered by lining)  \nMethod: stamp  \nContent: C[OU]LEURS FINES TOILES PEINDRE / TABLEAUX / REY &amp; PERROD / [5]1 Rue de la Rochefou[cauld] / PARIS (fig. 7.18)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe canvas was prepared with a white ground that extends to the edges of the tacking margins and fills the fine canvas weave. The thickness of the priming, averaging approximately 50\u2013100 \u00b5m, suggests that there may have been multiple applications. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the preparation is probably a double layer, with both layers of very similar composition and the second applied shortly after the first. The X-ray shows an apparent buildup of paint or ground material in a vertical section just left of center that does not correspond to any visible element in the painting. The haphazard, sometimes sharp-edged marks seen in the X-ray may indicate application of a (perhaps localized) preparatory layer with a palette knife (fig. 7.19). Toward the edges of this area, especially near the top, brushstrokes are visible, suggesting that this layer may initially have been applied with a palette knife, then worked into the surface with a brush. This layer also looks different from the surrounding areas: it is more heavily and unevenly textured and contains a number of large lead-containing protrusions (fig. 7.20). Elsewhere on the surface, however, a shallow, fine, diagonal texture can be seen, which may mean that the upper layer was applied or finished with a brush (fig. 7.21). This texture appears to go to the edges of the tacking margins, passing over the foldover on all sides. As the weave is very fine, such a thick ground application, had it been applied with a palette knife alone, would have resulted in an extremely smooth, almost glassy surface. Adding a systematic texture to the upper layer allowed the surface to hold more paint, something especially important in this work because the paint layers are so thin.\n\nReasons for the localized application of additional priming left of center are unclear. There are small scratches in the ground layers (visible in the X-ray as diagonal marks on the lower and center left) that seem to have occurred before the work was painted and possibly before the additional ground layer was applied. It is possible that the extra material was added to cover these marks. The increased texture in this area makes the colors appear darker, because of increased saturation as the thin, translucent paint layers sank into the depressions, pooling more thickly and thus appearing more intense. These darker areas where the paint has pooled more thickly do not correspond to, cover, or accentuate compositional forms; therefore, it is unlikely that this was an intentional effect desired or requested by the artist. However, Renoir would have been aware of the effect immediately, and while he may not have intended it, there is no evidence that he made any attempt to diminish it.\n\nThe ground is exposed throughout the painting, especially on the upper right. In many areas, the paint layers are very thin, allowing the lightness and texture of the ground to show through (fig. 7.22).\n\nCareful stereomicroscopic examination of the surface indicates a bright white ground with very few dark or colored particles visible (fig. 7.23).\n\nThe commercial ground appears to be a double application of priming material containing predominantly lead white with barium sulfate and variable trace amounts of silica; calcium-based white; silicate minerals with associated iron oxides, including umber; alumina; and small particles of ultramarine blue. The area of apparent additional preparation, just left of center, was found to have the same composition. The binder is estimated to be oil; the upper layer of the ground application looks less dense in the backscattered electron (BSE) image, which may indicate that this layer contains slightly more medium (fig. 7.24).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography or under microscopic examination.\n\nThe primary technique Renoir employed in making this painting was to layer very thin, translucent veils of paint in order to make use of the reflective qualities of the white ground. On the upper right, he left the ground mostly exposed to hint at the light source. On the left, the paint layers that make up the woman and her costume are so thin that they are not readily visible in the X-ray (fig. 7.19). The X-ray does show a few of the highly textured flower petals and white highlights, in addition to an apparent buildup of ground material as a vertical form left of center. To create the flesh tones, the artist mixed red lake and cobalt blue, sometimes with a small amount of yellow or vermilion, but generally without white, layering the colors so thinly that the highlights and glow of the flesh are largely a result of light reflecting off of the priming (fig. 7.25).\n\nRenoir both thinned and added fluid medium to his paints to achieve translucent washes and glazes. The thinness of the underlying washes is apparent throughout the background and contrasts with the more glaze-like handling of the figure\u2019s dress and flesh tones (fig. 7.26). In some areas, the artist used a cloth to wipe paint away, leaving only a small amount in the depressions of the canvas weave. This technique can be seen in the cloth the woman holds in the foreground, where the shadow across the top curve is indicated by the residue of blue paint that has been largely wiped away (fig. 7.27). Renoir may also have employed this technique in the underlayers throughout the figure, especially in her hair and costume. The only obvious indication of a change to the figure is along the top of the woman\u2019s right shoulder, which appears to have been slightly lowered before it was fully defined. Because the paint layers are so thin, evidence of this change is still visible on the left (fig. 7.28). The somewhat darkened appearance of the paint immediately to the right of the figure suggests that the artist made additional changes and wiped away some paint; however, the nature and subject of these changes are unclear.\n\nIn contrast to his handling of the rest of the picture, Renoir built up the flowers on the upper right with thicker paint and small dabs of heavy impasto (fig. 7.29). As a final touch, the artist added highlights in pure white on the vase (fig. 7.30) and on the comb holding the figure\u2019s hair (fig. 7.31) to clarify the light source on the upper right.\n\nVery fine, round brushes, some with wider strokes up to 1 cm wide; cloth for wiping.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, iron oxide red, vermilion, madder lake, bone black, zinc yellow, chrome yellow, strontium yellow, and possibly barium yellow.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination and cross-sectional analysis indicate that the dull yellow, almost ocher-colored paint used in some of the flowers and in the gathered fabric in the foreground is not the common earth pigment, but a complex mixture including zinc yellow, black, and madder lake (fig. 7.32).\n\nThe observation of a characteristic orange fluorescence under UV light indicates that the artist used large amounts of fluorescing red lake, identified as madder lake, mixed with other colors to create the flesh tones, hair, and costume (fig. 7.33). In the UV image, the tabletop on the right appears to be painted almost entirely with this lake color (fig. 7.34).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish was applied during the 1969 treatment and replaced an oil-resin varnish. There are residues of this earlier varnish around areas of impasto (especially the signature). It is unknown whether this varnish was original to the painting; however, abrasion noted in the pretreatment report suggests that the painting had been cleaned previously (see Conservation History).\n\nThe painting\u2019s only documented treatment was a 1969 lining. Grime and a discolored oil-resin varnish were removed, and the work was taken off of its original stretcher. The painting was faced with mulberry-fiber paper and starch paste and wax-resin lined to a secondary piece of linen. The lined painting was restretched on an ICA spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions, leaving a margin of exposed ground around the perimeter. The work was inpainted and given three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by inpainting, a layer of methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe work is in good condition, planar with a stable wax-resin lining. Heavy craquelure can be seen throughout the work, especially in raking light, and includes stretcher-bar marks corresponding to the original stretcher. There is a small loss along the line of buttons just under the figure\u2019s left hand and a loss of impasto in the flowers to the right of her hair. Long diagonal creases, which extend from the left edge behind the figure\u2019s head down toward her hands, seem to have occurred during the preparation of the canvas, and original paint settled into the depressions associated with them. The inpainting is discolored and visible in many areas of the face, hair, and hands, and around the edges. In most cases, the retouching addresses areas of abrasion and traction cracking. The work has a synthetic varnish imparting even saturation and gloss; there are two large, matte surface drips in the lower left quadrant.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame appears to be original to the painting. It is a French, late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, gilt ogee frame with cast plaster anthemia corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches, linked by fleurs-de-lis surrounded by scrolls and strapwork. The frame has oil and water gilding over red bole on cast plaster and gesso. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The gilding is heavily rubbed and toned with a casein or gouache raw umber wash with a gray overwash and dark flecking. The pine molding is mitered and nailed. At some point in the frame\u2019s history, the original verso was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance, a back frame was added, and all back and interior surfaces were painted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is torus with dentil outer molding; scotia side; ogee face with anthemia corner cartouches and fleur-de-lis center cartouches on diamond-punched beds, linked by fleurs-de-lis surrounded by foliate scrolls and strapwork on a quadrillage bed; sanded front frieze bordered with fillets; and ogee sight molding with leaf-tip ornament linked by scrolls and strapping on a recut bed (fig. 7.35, fig. 7.36).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from [unknown] by Charles Deudon (died 1914), Paris and Nice.\n\nAcquired by Paul Rosenberg and Co., Paris and New York, by Feb. 1921.\n\nAcquired by Howard Young, New York.\n\nAcquired by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, by June 1931.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932) to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Paul Rosenberg, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres de grands ma\u00eetres du dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, May 3\u2013June 3, 1922, cat. 74.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Exhibition of the Mrs. L.

The milliner was a contemporary-life topic that intrigued both Renoir and his Impressionist colleague Edgar Degas. Renoir visited Parisian milliners\u2019 shops for his painting At the Milliner\u2019s (c. 1878; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University Art Museums, Cambridge, Mass. [Daulte 274; Dauberville 238]). Margot was the model for that painting, so it must have been made before February 1879. For Degas and the milliner subject, see Gloria Groom, \u201cEdgar Degas: The Millinery Shop,\u201d in Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, ed. Gloria Groom, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Yale University Press, 2012), pp. 218\u201331. Daulte and Dauberville refer to the Renoir catalogues raisonn\u00e9s: Fran\u00e7ois Daulte, Auguste Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre peint (Durand-Ruel, 1971); Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vols. 1\u20135 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007\u201314).\n\nJean Renoir, Renoir, My Father (Little, Brown, 1962), p. 214. Jean Renoir wrote that Aline had known Renoir for several years before she appeared in Luncheon of the Boating Party and posed when she had time off from work.\n\nA number of letters from Renoir to Aline, many dating to the early years of their relationship, came to light as the result of a recent sale of Renoir archives: Pierre Auguste Renoir, 1841\u20131919: Personal Artifacts and Archives Collection, sold as one lot by Hantman\u2019s, Potomac, Md., May 14, 2005. Letter 57 (undated, but here assigned to August 1880) refers to Aline\u2019s staying a few days at the Maison Fournaise and requests that she tell Alphonsine Fournaise that Renoir would be coming around September 8 to finish Luncheon of the Boating Party. The work in progress was being stored with Baron Barbier, who also lodged at the Fournaise establishment and appears in the painting. (\u201cTu diras \u00e0 Madame Alphonsine que je pense aller \u00e0 Chatou vers le 8 septembre \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s \u00e0 moins de mauvais temps. Je voudrais terminer mon Canot qui chez le Baron.\u201d) The letter continues by asking Aline to follow up on certain housekeeping tasks in Renoir\u2019s studio.\n\nThe costume of the figure in Young Woman Sewing is not unlike that of a shopgirl, with its buttoned bodice over a white blouse, but it is embellished with earrings and a blue hair comb, which imply a certain middle-class comfort and respectability. For example, compare the costume worn by James Tissot\u2019s The Shop Girl from the series Women of Paris (1883\u201385; Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto).\n\nJohn House, \u201cBather (known as Blonde Bather I),\u201d in Hayward Gallery, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Renoir, exh. cat.

Deudon had been collecting Impressionist paintings since 1878, when he acquired Renoir\u2019s The Dancer (1874; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) from Paul Durand-Ruel. See Anne Distel, \u201cCharles Deudon (1832\u20131914) collectionneur,\u201d Revue de l\u2019art, no. 86 (1989), p. 59. As there is no record of Young Woman Sewing in the Durand-Ruel stock book, Deudon may have acquired it directly from Renoir at an early date. See Flavie Durand-Ruel and Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 5, 2010, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRobert L.

When told by a delegation of artists that they had thrown their tubes of black paint into the Seine, apparently in admiration of him, Renoir responded, \u201cBut black is a very important color, perhaps the most important.\u201d Jean Renoir, Renoir, My Father (Little, Brown, 1962), p. 177. Sylvie Patry has proposed the House of Roger as the designer of Madame Charpentier\u2019s dress, which has traditionally been attributed to the House of Worth.

Scratches throughout the canvas, especially on the lower left, seem to have occurred during the preparation process. The extra material looks light, or radio opaque, in the X-ray, indicating a heavier buildup of material, either paint or ground, in these areas. As the paint layers that make up the visible composition are extremely thin, this extra material can be attributed to the ground. The additional priming in this area was found to have the same components as the rest of the commercial preparation, suggesting that it was applied by the color merchant or manufacturer and not by Renoir. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the paint used for the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue. The presence of cobalt was confirmed with XRF. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_YWSewing\\_33\\_452\\_XRF results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2009, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, treatment report, Jan.\u2013Feb. 1969, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nWhile in the collection of Charles Deudon, the painting was listed with these dimensions in Paul Rosenberg, Paris, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres de Grands Maitres du dix-neuvieme siecle, exh. cat.

Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Young Woman Sewing, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1879 (D299/1933.452),\u201d Feb. 2012.\n\nThis depth measurement is based on the original tacking margins, which are somewhat damaged due to age and previous treatment.\n\nRey &amp; Perrod, seller of colors and painting restorer, was located at 51, rue de La Rochefoucauld and 64, rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette. This stamp is also seen on the verso of Renoir\u2019s Chrysanthemums (1881/82; cat. 15). See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cBarbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46, 1 (2001), p. 66.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nCross-sectional analysis showed evidence of lead-containing clumps, most likely dried, unevenly mixed ground material. These protrusions are mostly solid, with limited evidence of lead soap formation. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSome of these scratches appear white, or radio opaque, in the X-ray, indicating a heavier buildup of material, either paint or ground, in these areas. As the paint layers that make up the visible composition are extremely thin, this extra material can be attributed to the ground. The additional priming was found to have the same components as the rest of the commercial preparation, suggesting that it was applied by the color merchant or manufacturer and not by Renoir.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. The presence of lead and calcium were confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected barium sulfate, silica, silicate minerals with iron oxide and umber, alumina, and ultramarine blue. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_YWSewing\\_33\\_452\\_XRF results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2009; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: cobalt blue (XRF, SEM/EDX); vermilion (XRF); madder lake (aluminum-phosphorus substrate) (SEM/EDX, SERS). The yellow in the flesh tones was not specifically analyzed. The mixture in the flesh tones was identified by stereomicroscopic examination in conjunction with XRF. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_YWSewing\\_33\\_452\\_XRF results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2009; Federica Pozzi, \u201cRen\\_WomSewing\\_1933\\_452\\_SERS\\_results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, all on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, iron oxide red, zinc yellow, chrome yellow, strontium yellow, possibly barium yellow (XRF, SEM/EDX); madder lake (aluminum-phosphorus substrate) (SEM/EDX, SERS); bone black (SEM/EDX); vermilion (XRF). For the yellow pigments, while evidence of zinc, chromium, and strontium is strong, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the trace of barium detected in conjunction with chromium could be related to a barium sulfate extender. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cRen\\_YWSewing\\_33\\_452\\_XRF results,\u201d Dec. 8, 2009; Federica Pozzi, \u201cRen\\_WomSewing\\_1933\\_452\\_SERS\\_results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, all on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present.\n\nZinc yellow (zinc chromate), barium yellow (barium chromate), and strontium yellow (strontium chromate), were often available alone or in mixtures, sometimes sold under the name \u201clemon yellow,\u201d referring to its hue rather than its chemical composition. See \u201clemon yellow\u201d in CAMEO (Conservation and Art Materials Encyclopedia Online): http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Lemon\\_yellow.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: zinc yellow (XRF, SEM/EDX); bone black (SEM/EDX); madder lake (aluminum-phosphorus substrate) (SEM/EDX, SERS). This color may also contain lead white and/or chrome yellow. This may be the kind of mixture Renoir was referring to in his notebook, c. 1877: \u201cThe yellow ochre, Naples yellow and Siena earth are intermediate tones only and can be omitted once their equivalents can be made with other colors.\u201d See Jean Renoir, Renoir, My Father (Little, Brown, 1962), p. 360; Renoir\u2019s list is reproduced in Anthea Callen, Renoir (Oresko, 1978), p. 15, fig. 6.\n\nMadder lake was identified by SERS; SEM/EDX analysis of cross sections suggested that the artist used a single red lake pigment with an aluminum-phosphorus substrate. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cRen\\_WomSewing\\_1933\\_452\\_SERS\\_results,\u201d Oct. 10, 2013; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_452\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Apr. 30, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.
