    "description": "<p>Although influenced by Abstract Expressionist artists in New York in the early 1950s, Joan Mitchell did not prioritize self-expression: her often exuberant abstractions were \u201cabout landscape, not about me,\u201d she once explained. Mitchell painted large, light-filled canvases animated by loosely applied skeins of bright color\u2014here infused with the energy of a large metropolis.</p>\n<p>The title suggests a relationship between the painting\u2019s network of pigments and the nerves or arteries of an urban space. The sense of spontaneity conveyed in City Landscape, however, belies Mitchell\u2019s methods. Unlike many of her contemporaries, who were dubbed \u201caction painters,\u201d Mitchell worked slowly and deliberately. \u201cI paint a little,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. Eventually, the painting tells me what to do.\u201d</p>\n",
