    "description": "<p>This elegant book unites all of the known carte postale prints by the photographer Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz (1894\u20131985), including portraits, views of Paris, careful studio scenes, and exquisitely simple still lifes. Essays shed new light on the artist\u2019s most acclaimed images; themes of materiality, exile, and communication; his illustrious and bohemian social circle; and the changing identity of art photography. Playful yet refined, the book\u2019s design reflects the spirit of 1920s Paris while underscoring the modernity of the catalogue\u2019s more than 250 illustrated works. Kert\u00e9sz made his rigorously composed prints on inexpensive but lush postcard stock, sharing them with friends and sending them back to family in Hungary. The works reveal the artist learning his craft as he encountered an international group of modernists\u2014including Piet Mondrian, Fernand L\u00e9ger, and Joseph Cs\u00e1ky\u2014in the interwar metropolis. Prized by collectors as well as by Kert\u00e9sz himself, the cartes postales influenced his compositions and the intimate scale of his picture-making for decades.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Elizabeth Siegel is curator of photography and media at the Art Institute of Chicago.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Edited by Elizabeth Siegel; With essays by Sarah Kennel, Sylvie Penichon, and Elizabeth Siegel</p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8 x 10.25 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 240</li><li><strong>Illustrations:&nbsp;</strong>390 duotone + 10 color illus.</li></ul>",
