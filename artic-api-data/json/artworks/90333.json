    "description": "<p>Charles Courtney Curran documented the atmosphere and activity of the Art Students\u2019 League in New York, where he studied and later taught. Here male and female students practice rendering the idealized human form. Students worked from casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, as well as from reproductions of classically inspired Renaissance objects, such as Michelangelo\u2019s allegorical sculpture <em>Night</em> from the tomb of Giuliano de\u2019Medici, which occupies the lower left corner of this painting. In the 19th century <em>Night</em> would not only have served as an effective demonstration of the art of antiquity but would also have represented one of the more difficult poses to illustrate. Once students mastered drawing antique and antique-inspired sculptures, they would have advanced to a class with live models.</p>\n",
