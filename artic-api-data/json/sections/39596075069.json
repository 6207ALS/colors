In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 55.1, fig. 55.2, fig. 55.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in c. 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see cat. 55.1) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin (see cat. 55.2, cat. 55.3, and cat. 55.4) and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. The analysis that follows of what the print depicts relies on a 1921 impression (cat. 55.5), which conveys all of the information that Gauguin inscribed and carved into the woodblock. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nThe fifth print of the Noa Noa Suite, Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.2, cat. 55.3, cat. 55.4), depicts a golden age in which Tahitians live in harmony with themselves, nature, and their gods. The plate corresponds to a text in Gauguin\u2019s bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage \u00e0 Tahiti. The print\u2019s title relates to a passage in chapter 6, in which Gauguin describes a journey he undertook to find a female companion:\n\nDigressing from the path bordering the sea, I follow a narrow trail across a thicket, which extends quite far into the mountain, finally arriving in a small valley whose inhabitants live according to the ancient Maori lifestyle. They are happy and peaceful. They dream, love, sleep, and sing\u2014they pray, and I can clearly make out, although not really there, the statues of their female godheads\u2014the images of Hina\u2014and the celebrations in honor of this lunar goddess. The idol, a solid block, measures ten feet from shoulder to shoulder and forty in height. On her head she wears a giant stone resembling a reddish bonnet. Around her they dance according to the rituals from long ago\u2014Matamua\u2014and the vivo\u2019s note fluctuates, distinct and merry or dismal and sad, depending on the mood.\n\nThe horizontal composition is divided into zones that define fore-, middle, and background. The foreground contains a monumental statue of Hina, the Tahitian moon goddess, which is not crowned by a \u201cgiant stone resembling a bonnet\u201d but rather by hair that sweeps behind the goddess\u2019s ear and down her back. Seen in profile, she sits on a throne-like form whose base is decorated with two hard-to-identify elements, one of which is possibly a fish. Behind Hina are two figures, one whose back is turned to the viewer and the other who kneels and plays a vivo (a Tahitian nose flute; see fig. 55.4). In front of the statue, at the center of the composition, a standing figure looks back at the idol. On the ground below are three kapok seedpods that have burst open, revealing their fluffy, fibrous interiors (see fig. 55.5). The lower right of the composition contains the title of the print and Gauguin\u2019s monogram. In the middle distance, a horse and rider gallop past a stand of coconut palms toward a hut, next to which is a grove of mango trees whose branches and leaves seem to explode around Hina\u2019s head and upper torso. In the background, gentle hills lie against a high mountain with a deep valley and a V-shaped slice of sky.\n\nTo represent this idyllic scene, Gauguin drew upon several paintings he had executed in Tahiti, borrowing motifs that he unified into one composition. The most closely related of these is Hina maruru (Thanks to Hina) from 1893 (fig. 55.6 [W 500; Field 1977 53]). The composition is almost identical to that of the right side of the print, which the printing process reversed. Gauguin extended the painting\u2019s composition by adding the horse and rider, freestanding palms, and sweeping vista of hills and mountains. Neither Maruru nor Hina maruru includes a depiction of the kapok tree from which the seedpods would have fallen. A kapok tree, identifiable by its buttress roots, commands the center of another painting with a similar theme, the 1892 Mata mua (In Olden Times) (fig. 55.7 [W 467, Field 1977 51]), which shares many elements of Maruru, including the statue and figures tending to it, vivo player, seedpods, mango trees, hut, and the crevassed mountain silhouetted against the sky. This painting did not sell when exhibited at Durand-Ruel and was among those returned to Gauguin\u2019s studio (see fig. 55.3).\n\nFrom his 1892 canvas Fatata te moua (At the Foot of a Mountain) (fig. 55.8 [W 481, Field 1977, 49]), the artist borrowed the horse and rider and the coconut palms; the painting also features a large mango and includes a hut. Fatata te moua shows a figure\u2014possibly Gauguin himself\u2014walking toward the pitched-roof dwelling and its neighboring grove of mango trees, which match the description the artist provided of his living circumstances in Mataiea. In this way, he imagined the tranquil scene as taking place in the immediate environs of his home. He did much the same when depicting his stoneware sculpture Oviri (fig. 55.9 [Gray 113]) in the wood-block print Oviri in a comparable setting (fig. 55.10 [Kornfeld 35]). The site, with its commanding mango, features as well in two 1892 paintings, The Tree, Tahiti (fig. 55.11 [W 482], [Field 1977] 72; and Noa Noa (fig. 55.12 [W] 487, [Field 1977] 45]). Three 1894 watercolor-transfer monotypes (see fig. 55.13), featuring the mango tree, Gauguin\u2019s hut, and the horse and rider, mirror the painting Fatata te moua.\n\nWith the arrival of Christianity in Polynesia in the early nineteenth century, images of Maori gods had virtually disappeared by the time Gauguin arrived. Thus, as he admitted in chapter 6 of Noa Noa, he invented and visualized them in natural settings. The monumental size of the statue he described may reflect his familiarity with the large stone heads on Easter Island, called moai, which are topped by conical, reddish hat forms (see fig. 55.14). But other than that, Gauguin\u2019s images of Hina and other deities came from his imagination; indeed, Noa Noa is in part fictional, a text and illustrations in which he married his documentary observations of the people and land around him with pure inventions that evoke an ancient, mythic past. The statue in Mararu derives from an image of the seated Hina on the back of a wood sculpture the artist made in 1892, Tii with a Pearl (fig. 55.15 [Gray 94]).\n\nThe main motifs of both Hina maruru and Maruru emerge again as a bucolic backdrop for a nude woman lying in a fetal position in the foreground of the wood-block print Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (fig. 55.16 [cat. 77.3]). The motifs appear here twice, side by side, underscoring Gauguin\u2019s attachment to the site. They are present as well in an 1894 design for a fan (fig. 55.17 [W 469]), whose composition is close to that of the painting Mata mua.\n\nAt a later date, Gauguin pasted a hand-colored fragment of an early state of Maruru, showing Hina and the mango grove, on page 59 (folio 32R) of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 55.18). On page [60] (folio 33R), he adhered a hand-colored portion of his Manao tupapau print that includes the mango tree and the artist\u2019s dwelling (fig. 55.19). The appearance of these symbols of Gauguin\u2019s home in Mataiea in so many works executed after he left Tahiti suggests the allure his memories of it continued to exert during a time of challenges and disappointments for the artist.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The title of this print is a Tahitian word, m\u0101uruuru, meaning \u201ccontented,\u201d which comes from \u016br\u016b (inspired) and has been used to express thanks since the period of contact with Europeans. The composition derives principally from a painting entitled Hina maruru (fig. 55.20 [W 500]), included in Gauguin\u2019s 1893 exhibition at Durand-Ruel, Paris, the catalogue of which lists the French title as F\u00eate \u00e0 Hina (Feast of Hina). Bengt Danielsson observed that \u201cdue to the complete lack of connecting particles . . . , the title can as well mean Hina is content as Thanks to Hina.\u201d The latter comes closer to Feast of Hina, insofar as the celebration can be understood as manifesting the participants\u2019 gratitude to Hina, the Tahitian moon goddess (see cat. 53, Commentary), but the former is not thereby excluded, since the celebration plausibly causes her contentment. The ambiguity of the title, allowing Hina to be subject or object, is typical of Gauguin\u2019s use of the Tahitian language and was certainly intentional; he employed it to the same effect in his choice of Auti te pape (Women at the River) (see cat. 59, Commentary) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (see cat. 60, Commentary). In this case, the reading \u201cHina is content\u201d is documented in the dedication inscribed by Gauguin on an impression of Maruru that he later gave to the poet and art critic Andr\u00e9 Fontainas (fig. 55.21): \u201cDu Tahiti lointain. / Ce qu\u2019y vit Gauguin: / une Idole repue\u201d (From faraway Tahiti, what Gauguin saw there: a sated Idol). On a phonetic level, in addition to the iteration and alliteration that also characterize Noa Noa and a great many of Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian titles, he may have valued in m\u0101uruuru the onomatopoeic suggestion of a purring animal, fitting the notion of contentment or satiation.\n\nMaruru is closer to the text of Noa Noa than the other plates of the suite. In the sixth chapter, the narrator, slightly depressed and without a mistress, embarks on a journey around the island and soon leaves the coastal path for \u201ca thicket that leads far into the mountains. Arrive at a small valley. There several people live and want to go on living in the old way.\u201d At this point of the draft at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, Gauguin indicated that a description of the paintings Hina maruru and Mata mua (In Olden Times) (fig. 55.22 [W 467]) should be inserted, which was done in the manuscript held at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), and further elaborated by Charles Morice in the 1901 edition of the book. Like the narrator\u2019s other incursions into the interior of the island, this one led him away from present-day Tahiti toward the past for which he had been searching. Indeed, Tahitians lived along the coast, leaving the mystery of the mountainous and verdant interior intact, which enabled Morice to imagine, in a poem inspired by Gauguin\u2019s painting Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (fig. 55.23 [W 483) and illustrated by Armand S\u00e9guin (fig. 55.24), that a large temple would have stood on its summit.\n\nAccording to Jehanne Teilhet-Fisk, Gauguin painted Hina maruru and Mata mua after he had tried and failed to leave Tahiti, and they \u201creflect a more lyrical and positive portrait of Polynesia,\u201d obtained by turning his back on the effects of civilization and depicting \u201cthe happier aspects of the ancient Polynesian rituals.\u201d Similarly, Maruru reminded Stephen Eisenman of Virgil\u2019s Eclogues and represents for Peter Zegers \u201ca golden age in which Tahitians live in harmony with themselves, nature, and their gods\u201d (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). Compared with the two paintings, however, the print exhibits a more enigmatic and possibly disquieting atmosphere, because of its general obscurity and stark contrasts between light and shade, as can be seen in an impression printed in brown and gray and hand-colored by Gauguin (cat. 55.2) or in another that abounds in phosphorescent effects (cat. 55.3). Maruru emphasizes the visionary character of the scene, which the relevant passage of Noa Noa, although inserted in what claims to be a truthful account, makes no attempt at concealing: \u201cAnd I see distinctly, although they are not really there, the statues of their female godheads.\u201d It is a fiction that endeavors to fulfill the wish expressed at the beginning of the text, after the narrator\u2019s disappointing arrival in Papeete and the death of King Pomare: \u201cTo get back to the ancient hearth, revive the fire in the midst of all these ashes.\u201d\n\nFormally, the representation here of Hina derives from figures of ti\u2018i (\u201ctiki\u201d in Marquesan), representing deified ancestors with bent knees and hands resting on their stomachs, traditionally carved on all manner of Polynesian objects, from ear ornaments (see cat. 45) to fan handles (see fig. 55.25) and stilt steps. Larger, freestanding tiki made of wood, stone, or coral had been placed on marae (places of worship), but they were denounced by the missionaries as \u201cidols\u201d and instruments of witchcraft and accordingly were destroyed (see fig. 55.26), taken away, or concealed. A few remained in situ in the Marquesas Islands, including on Hiva Oa (where Gauguin moved in 1901) the eight-foot-high stone image of Takai\u2018i (fig. 55.27), which the artist later drew (fig. 55.28), possibly from a photograph. Moreover, the description of the statue of Hina in the Louvre manuscript and the 1901 edition of Noa Noa indicates an additional source, Oceanic yet more remote: \u201cThe idol, a solid block, measures ten feet from shoulder to shoulder and forty in height. On her head she wears as a bonnet a giant stone of reddish color.\u201d The reference is to the mo\u2018ai of Rapa Nui (Easter Island), mentioned in Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an and of which Julien Viaud\u2014later famous as Pierre Loti\u2014in 1872 had made drawings published in more or less sensationalizing forms, as in a depiction of an \u201cidol festival\u201d (fig. 55.29). The statues depicted in Hina maruru, Mata mua, and Maruru do not resemble the mo\u2018ai, however, but rather represent a streamlined, female (or androgynous) version of the typical tiki. The abstraction of its outline is consistent with the Synthetism that Gauguin had advocated before leaving France and with his defense of the \u201cdecorative\u201d in art: the point symmetry between the legs of the statue and its back, for example, can be compared with Owen Jones\u2019s recommendations for the transitions of curved lines in The Grammar of Ornament (see fig. 55.30), and the way in which the upper edge of Hina\u2019s pareu flows beyond her arm into the horizon of Maruru contributes to a harmonious integration of figure with landscape.\n\nZegers identifies the scene as representing the immediate environs of Gauguin\u2019s home in Mataiea (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), which appears logical in relation to the artist\u2019s personal involvement in this evocation of a precolonial and pre-Christian past. Extending the composition of Hina maruru and Mata mua into a horizontal format, Gauguin added the cluster of coconut trees and the galloping horse and rider on the left, counterbalancing the group formed by the statue and the three women with a dynamic (and probably male) element. Zegers identifies as kapok seedpods the three white shapes in the foreground (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), which strongly resemble the crest of the breaking waves in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (fig. 55.31 [cat. 54.3]; see also cat. 54, Commentary). Despite their apparent meaninglessness, they are also present in the two paintings and may thus bear witness to the same quasi-cryptographic quality as the dried pandanus leaves in Noa Noa (see cat. 51, Commentary). In a later manuscript, L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme (Catholicism and the Modern Mind), Gauguin attributed the same decorative and transcendent dimension to Tahitian vegetation: \u201cThe flowers exult and seduce you with caresses gathered in bouquets. Fairies arrange them without betraying their mysterious designs\u2014ornaments of Gods and men.\u201d\n\nThe same can be said of the most important natural element, the enormous tree (or group of trees) that, as Stephen Eisenman noted, \u201cfunctions in the print like a halo or mandorla.\u201d An examination of this area in the wood matrix for Maruru (cat. 55.1) confirms the wealth of formal and textural information that it contains and the care with which Gauguin articulated the treatment of Hina\u2019s head and the foliage, including curved lines carved symmetrically at the base of the nose and in front of it. As a result, the canopy not only brings out the statue and dignifies the goddess, but also, by resembling a phylactery and a cloud, suggests that Hina speaks or breathes\u2014a suggestion further supported by the woman playing the vivo, a nasal flute (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), who turns toward the statue. Seen in this light, the attitudes of the two other women begin to make sense, because, while they seem to be moving away from statue, the one on the left directs her gaze toward it, possibly in response to an exhalation or utterance by the goddess. Be it as it may, Hina is represented as animated, in accordance with ancient Polynesian conceptions, not as an artifact, but as what anthropologists have come to call a \u201cperson other than human.\u201d The emphasis on the statue\u2019s head does justice to the proportions of tiki figures and to the link between head and mana (power). A detail of Parahi te marae (fig. 55.32) shows that Gauguin could bring the association between sacred image and tree to the point of conflation: facing the statue to the right, after a large tree and two coconut palms, is what appears to be another canopy, but reveals itself on closer examination to be a giant head. This association may derive from Moerenhout\u2019s explanation that marae were surrounded by majestic trees, regarded as sacred; their wind-rustled leaves produced a whistling sound that was attributed to the gods. Gauguin may also have reflected, when visiting ruined marae on Tahiti, that the only living witnesses of the ceremonies he was trying to imagine were the old trees around him.\n\nHina maruru, Mata mua, and Maruru do not represent marae, which women were prohibited from entering. The activities depicted by these works are not univocally religious either, and they do not reflect the often-caricatural attitudes of devotion generally included in Western representations of \u201cpagan\u201d and exotic worship (see fig. 55.33). The predominance of women in Gauguin\u2019s images of Tahiti has often been noted and finds a high point in these evocations of a female cult of a female deity. The real importance of Hina is an object of debate among specialists, but E. S. Craighill Handy stated that \u201cshe filled the important position of being the first woman in creation, the ancestress of men\u201d and of appearing sometimes \u201cin the actual worship as a patron of womankind and women\u2019s activities.\u201d It is remarkable that Gauguin, despite his express interest in the masculine and the violent aspects of ancient Tahiti, his search for the \u201cprimitive,\u201d and his taste for provocation, chose to avoid any explicit reference to the human sacrifices that had been part of the island\u2019s rituals, although they were described by Moerenhout and had been visualized since James Cook\u2019s voyages (see fig. 55.34). The artist may have done so for reasons of propriety and because he wanted to give an unequivocally positive image of the pre-Christian religion.\n\nIn Maruru, as in the painted versions, therefore, the cult of Hina draws on other models, such as the dance performances much praised by European visitors (see fig. 55.35). This derivation, and the fact that the scene does not take place within the sacred precinct of a marae, makes it appear not as a formal, specifically religious ceremony, but rather as an integral part of the daily life of the forgotten valley evoked in Noa Noa, whose inhabitants \u201cdream, love, sleep, sing\u2014pray.\u201d Yet there remains the fact that the atmosphere of Maruru is not entirely serene. With a skull motif on top of its fence, Parahi te marae alludes to the tribute requested from humans by gods, and one cannot exclude that the deity of the print possesses an element of ambivalence (see cat. 60, Commentary). A symptom could be Gauguin\u2019s description of it as a \u201csated idol\u201d (fig. 55.21), and another its resemblance to Oviri, the androgynous figure that the artist would soon define as a \u201ckiller-woman\u201d and depict embracing and crushing a young animal (see fig. 55.36 [Field 1973 30]).  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

Colta Ives identified the man at the lower-left corner of the photo as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris 506 W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten woodblock prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the prints do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.

The statue of Hina is found in Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (W 483) and in a related watercolor with the same title in the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University (Pickvance 14), but these depictions are secondary to the expansive landscape setting that surrounds them.\n\nThis painting, shown in Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition d\u2019oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Paul Gauguin (Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893), no. 26, also returned to the studio, unsold.\n\nGauguin described the setting as follows: \u201cD\u2019un c\u00f4t\u00e9, la mer, et de l\u2019autre, la montagne,\u2014la montagne b\u00e9aute [sic], crevasse formidable que bouchait . . . un groupe \u00e9norme de manguiers.

Hiriata Millaud suggested that Gauguin may also have played with words and referred to ruru, and notions such as protected, gathered, isolated, secret, and even tapu, all of which would correspond well to the secluded valley and the religious atmosphere evoked by the works in question; Millaud, \u201cLes titres tahitiens de Gauguin,\u201d in Ia orana Gauguin, exh. cat.

In this regard, it may be worth noting that Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout mentioned as \u201cmaro ourou\u201d the belt of red feathers (maro \u2018uru) that conferred sacredness to its bearer and that he compared a chant in which Hina deplores its loss to the Egyptian legend of Isis and Osiris.
