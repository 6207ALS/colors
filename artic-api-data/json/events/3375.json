    "description": "<p><strong>The theme for this month\u2019s Intersections is The Question of Patriotism.</strong></p><p>From the American flag to the national anthem, cultural objects play an important role in historical memory and national identity. An act of protest or defiance can force us to contend with differing definitions of patriotism. By looking at ways that artists have incorporated the American flag into their work, we\u2019ll explore the complicated layers of ambiguity around this familiar symbol.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information. </p>",
