    "description": "<p>Known for her iconic images of the Great Depression, documentary photographer Dorothea Lange cultivated a photographic approach that was at once ruthless and empathetic. Between 1955 and 1957, she worked on a photo essay, <em>Public Defender,</em> which documented legal challenges for indigents accused at the Alameda County Courthouse, in downtown Oakland, California. Lange followed 36-year-old public defender Martin N. Pulich as he worked in his office, advocated in the courtroom, and visited clients in jail cells. Originally intended for <em>Life</em> magazine, the series was instead published as an uncredited four-page spread in a Filipino newspaper. In January 1966, just months after Lange\u2019s death, a retrospective exhibition was mounted at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, featuring this stark image of a police van (called a \u201cBlack Maria\u201d) along with three other photographs from <em>Public Defender.</em></p>\n",
