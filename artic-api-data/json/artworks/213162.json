    "description": "<p>TikTok and LunaTik, designed by Scott Wilson and his studio Minimal, are multi-touch watch kits for the iPod Nano. Wilson\u2019s designs draw on a popular existing technology, transforming it into a modern, multifunctional timepiece and expanding the functionality of the standard wristwatch. TikTok\u2019s simple snap-in design, inspired by ski bindings, features a reinforced polycarbonate case that protects the iPod and allows the user to quickly and securely snap the iPod in and out of the wrist dock. Wilson and his team designed LunaTik as a more permanent conversion kit targeted to those who want to use their iPod Nano primarily as a watch. Made of aircraft-grade aluminum, LunaTik was crafted with rapid-prototyping technology, a technique that produces three-dimensional objects from a computer model.</p>\n",
