Olivia Simes Morris was also a member of the city\u2019s cultural elite, her husband having been a cofounder of the Columbianum, a short-lived artists\u2019 association that Charles Willson Peale organized. <em>Olivia Simes Morris</em> is a sensitive portrayal of the sitter. Embellishments of lace and a richly colored embroidered shawl add notes of refinement to an otherwise restrained composition. James Peale practiced portraiture throughout his long career. In addition to oil portraits, he excelled at miniatures, delicate likenesses of watercolor on ivory.</p>\n",
