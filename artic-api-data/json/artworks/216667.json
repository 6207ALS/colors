    "description": "<p>Writing in London, Adam Thirlwell developed his novel Kapow! during the wave of revolutionary protests occurring throughout the Arab world in the spring of 2011, known as the Arab Spring. Thrilwell wrote of two interconnected characters\u2014living in London and Egypt\u2014who are transformed by the ongoing revolutions. Published by Visual Editions, this book employs the firm\u2019s approach to visual writing, in which the design reflects the content of the book to engage the reader in a new and unexpected experience. Studio Frith\u2019s design reflects the novel\u2019s plot and parallels the disruption inherent in a revolution: shapes of text are disjointed from the main body, rotated, reinserted, and often extended to a hidden fold-out page. Thirwell described how the story was formed based on geographically dislocated facts about the Arab Spring he heard in London, which created a reality based on both fact and rumor; the book\u2019s design reinforces this idea through the fragmented components that force the reader to a disjointed experience.</p>\n",
