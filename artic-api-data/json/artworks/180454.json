    "description": "<p>During World War II the US military sought to be as efficient as possible with its materials. Working with the Office of Strategic Services, Bertrand Goldberg responded with a novel idea for his Convertible Gun Crate project: a new design for the large crates used to ship antiaircraft guns overseas that allowed the containers to be easily converted into temporary structures upon delivery. Goldberg reported that between 250 and 500 of these crates were built and used for housing or field offices.</p>\n",
