    "description": "<p>Intoxicating Latin American dance rhythms blaze in energetic interpretations by four contemporary composers. Alberto Ginastera's Second String Quartet whirls with glowing intensity, while fellow Argentine composter Astor Piazzolla's <em>Four for Tango</em> is a fiery exhibition of his trademark \"nuevo tango.\" Metro Chabacano uses traditional Mexican dances to depict a bustling Mexico City subway station. American composer John Zorn, known for his quirky and eclectic works, shares musical snapshots, including Argentine tango, in <em>Cat O'Nine Tails</em>. Following the concert, tour works by Latin American artists throughout the galleries.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
