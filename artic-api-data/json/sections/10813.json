The drawing on the recto is a preliminary version of Arrangement in Black, No. 2: Portrait of Mrs. Louis Huth (fig. 14.1, [YMSM 125]) in vivid pastel, while the drawing on the verso (fig. 14.2) reveals a less detailed but nonetheless significant sketch for Symphony in Flesh Color and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland (fig. 14.3, [YMSM 106]). Whistler often turned to pastel to work out his ideas for his portraits. In addition to being an adaptable drawing medium that was readily available, it offered the significant advantage of allowing the artist to introduce and experiment with the element of color. Particularly in the drawing of Helen Ogilvy (Mrs. Louis) Huth, the blue, brown, gray, white, and touches of pink pastel provide much of the composition\u2019s structure and detail. As is typical of his portrait studies, Whistler here used black chalk for the outlines and contours of forms while relying on colored pastels and the paper itself to indicate the tonal complexities of the work. Even in the drawing of Frances Dawson (Mrs. Frederick) Leyland on the verso (which is upside down in relation to the recto), where both color and line are applied more sparingly, he accented the black chalk with white and pink pastel, suggesting the dominant color harmonies in the oil painting of Leyland.\n\nCharacteristic of Whistler\u2019s working method in this medium, he selected a coarse brown paper and applied the pastels thinly, which draws attention to the paper\u2019s uneven texture. Contemporaries Thomas R. Way and George R. Dennis observed that the methods Whistler employed in the pastel studies for his oil portraits remained consistent throughout his career: \u201cFor many years he made studies in pastel for his portraits and other paintings. . . . His manner of using the material was always the same from the beginning\u2014a clear outline of the subject in black on the brown paper, and then firm decisive strokes of colour, occasionally softened with a stump.\u201d\n\nThe two studies\u2019 primary impetus was to explore various compositional motifs for his oil paintings. The sketch of Mrs. Huth represents an intermediate phase in the design of the portrait. The pose and dress are translated fairly directly from the study to the painting, although the train is more extensive in the painting, and the viewpoint slightly higher. The most significant alterations were to the background and color scheme, where Whistler eliminated the decorative, variegated curtain and rug seen in the drawing in favor of a much sparer composition that is essentially a meditation on the tonal possibilities of a single hue: black. He also removed the strand of blue beads Huth holds in her right hand in the study, which he may have originally included to harmonize with the blue curtain. Only one other preparatory drawing exists for Arrangement in Black, No. 2. The sheet shows a simplified composition, indicating that it probably came after the Art Institute version, although it still features more ornamental detail than the oil painting (fig. 14.4; [M 455]).\n\nThe sheet\u2019s verso concentrates on the subject\u2019s pose and is the only extant drawing that features the distinctive attitude Frances Leyland assumes in the portrait, with her hands clasped behind her back and her body turned away from the viewer. For this reason, Branka Nakanishi suggests that it was probably the last of all the extant studies for the painting to be completed. The numerous other studies for the portrait mostly concentrate on the evolving design of the dress (fig. 14.5, [M 430]; fig. 14.6, [M 432]; and fig. 14.7, [M 433]). Though not the focus of the Art Institute drawing, the design of the dress in this version includes a number of elements seen in the finished oil, including the standing ruffled collar and the Rococo-inspired train with its distinctive rosettes. Unlike the study on the recto, which considers the overall composition of the Huth portrait, the drawing for Leyland\u2019s portrait on the verso attends to a few specific details.\n\nAs indicated by the fact that the sketches appear on the same sheet, Whistler worked concurrently on the portraits of Helen Huth and Frances Leyland. In fact, Leyland reported to Whistler\u2019s biographers that she \u201csometimes met Mrs. Huth as they came and went for their sittings.\u201d Leyland even claimed that she told Whistler she wanted to wear a black velvet dress like Huth\u2019s for her own portrait, but that he insisted she wear one he designed instead. Scholars speculate that another portrait by Whistler of Frances Leyland, the drypoint The Velvet Dress (fig. 14.8; [K 105]), may represent his attempt to placate her in this regard. Indeed, the print bears more than a little resemblance to the Huth portrait and the Art Institute study for it, encompassing similarities not only in the style of the dress but also in the figure\u2019s pose and the curtained background shown behind her.\n\nIn other respects, the two portraits on the Art Institute sheet do reveal instances of cross-fertilization. The dashes of white on the left edge of the drawing of Mrs. Huth may be a reference to a spray of flowers, such as those appearing in a similar location in the oil painting of Mrs. Leyland. Further, the rug in the Huth drawing\u2014although not included in the final painting of Huth\u2014was likely the one seen in the Leyland oil painting, albeit in a different palette. A version of this rug also appears in another oil portrait from the same period, Harmony in Grey and Green: Miss Cicely Alexander (fig. 14.9; [YMSM 129]). The patterned curtain in the drawing of Mrs. Huth has additionally been compared to the wall hanging in Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1: Portrait of the Artist\u2019s Mother (fig. 14.10; [YMSM 101]). These shared props reveal Whistler\u2019s fluidity with design elements between works\u2014what did not serve one in the final analysis might serve another.\n\nAside from registering significant stages in the design of two major works in Whistler\u2019s oeuvre, these drawings attest to a new and important direction for his work. Possibly spurred, as Richard Dorment has suggested, by three historic exhibitions of British portraiture held at the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum) in London between 1866 and 1868, Whistler began accepting commissions for full-scale oil portraits in the early 1870s. Such portraits would be important to his practice, both artistically and as sources of income, for the rest of his life. The two portraits on this sheet also present a type of patron that would prove critical to Whistler\u2019s success in the 1870s and beyond\u2014both women were part of an emerging group of newly middle-class and wealthy families who prospered as a result of the Industrial Revolution. They were also both wives of enthusiastic art collectors sympathetic to the Aesthetic Movement. Indeed, Whistler demonstrated the significance of both the clients and the work they supported when he included the Huth and Leyland oil portraits\u2014and possibly several of the drawn designs for Leyland\u2019s dress\u2014in his first solo retrospective exhibition in London in 1874.\n\nHelen Rose Ogilvy, the daughter of a merchant, was married to Louis Huth, the director of the London Assurance for Fire, Life, and Marine Assurance and the son of a wealthy merchant banker. The Huths collected numerous works by Whistler and George Frederick Watts, another artist associated with the Victorian avant-garde. They also apparently owned works attributed to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Like the Huths, Whistler admired the Spanish Baroque painter, and this shared appreciation clearly informed the final version of the Huth oil portrait. The commission Whistler received for the portrait of Helen Huth (600 guineas) was the highest he had ever collected for a single painting, and would remain so until the 1890s.\n\nFrances Leyland was, at the time, the wife of Frederick Leyland, a self-made man of working-class roots who had built a vast shipping empire. The couple later divorced, but not before amassing a sizable collection of works by Pre-Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne-Jones, William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. They were exceptionally generous patrons and friends of Whistler\u2019s beginning in the late 1860s, until the relationship soured as a result of a dispute over his designs for the dining room of the couple\u2019s London home at 49 Prince\u2019s Gate\u2014today known as the Peacock Room (see cat. 48)\u2014in 1877.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Study for \u201cArrangement in Black, No. 2: Portrait of Mrs. Huth\u201d (recto); Study for \u201cSymphony in Flesh Color and Pink: Portrait of Mrs. Frances Leyland\u201d (verso) correspond to Margaret F.
