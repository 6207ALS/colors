In the mid-19th century, Hudson River School painters reveled in the untamed scenery, but by the time Winslow Homer arrived on assignment from <em>Harper's Weekly</em> in 1868, the region was dominated by tourists and the comforts they demanded: grand hotels, railroads, and well-groomed trails for walking and riding. Homer depicted the eastern landscape as a stage for human activity, rather than as a sublime paradise fraught with Christian and nationalistic associations, which was a new approach to landscape painting in the years after the Civil War.</p>\n",
