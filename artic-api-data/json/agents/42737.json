    "description": "<p>The paintings, drawings and theoretical writings of Austrian-born artist Wolfgang Paalen were driven by a powerful fascination with the relationship between art, science, and magic.&nbsp;After joining the Paris Surrealist group alongside his wife, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/55561/alice-rahon\" target=\"_blank\">Alice Rahon</a>, in 1935, Paalen was struck by the creative possibilities of automatism, or performing actions without conscious thought. This principle was most notably expressed in his technique <em>fumage, </em>in which candle smoke is used to make impressions on an oil-paint-primed support. The billowing, unpredictable forms that resulted from this technique spoke to Paalen\u2019s penchant for harnessing the creative potential for chance, evident in his work <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/209555/l-autophage-fulgurites\" target=\"_blank\"><em>L\u2019autophage (Fulgurites)</em></a><em> </em>(1938).</p><p>In 1939, Paalen left Paris with Rahon and photographer Eva Sulzer to travel through the Pacific Northwest before journeying to Mexico. Following the outbreak of World War II, they settled together permanently in Mexico City where they quickly joined a group of innovative international artists, including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36397/diego-rivera\" target=\"_blank\">Diego Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/603/manuel-alvarez-bravo\" target=\"_blank\">Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/42671/leonora-carrington\" target=\"_blank\">Leonora Carrington</a>. In 1940, Paalen organized the <em>International Exhibition of Surrealism </em>in Mexico City with <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/3226/andre-breton\" target=\"_blank\">Andr\u00e9 Breton</a>, bringing together the artwork and ideas of his Surrealist colleagues then scattered by the war. However, by 1942 Paalen broke with the Surrealists, publishing his biting manifesto \u201cFarewell to Surrealism\u201d in the first issue of his ambitious, interdisciplinary journal <em>Dyn </em>(1942\u201344). With this public separation from the Surrealists, he formed a new experimental artistic group in the San Francisco Bay Area with painters Gordon Onslow Ford and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/62933/lee-mullican\" target=\"_blank\">Lee Mullican</a> and writer Jacqueline Johnson. Calling themselves <em>Dynaton</em>, these artists sought to redefine the possible through an exploration of the unconscious mind and past cultures.</p>",
