    "description": "<p>Lia Cook has long been occupied by issues of sensory perception. In addition to visual concerns, she has considered the sense of touch and how our brains react to the desire for tactile contact. Cook worked with scientists to compare the brain's response to viewing a woven image of a face with the response to viewing a photographic image of the same woven face. She discovered that seeing the woven image triggered greater activity in that part of the brain affected most by touch. <em>Facing Touch</em> illustrates this experiment. The test subject, dressed in a cap trailing the sensors that measure his neural responses, reaches out to touch a woven image, actually an enlarged version of Cook's own <em>Binary Traces: Young Girl</em>, created in 2004.</p>\n",
