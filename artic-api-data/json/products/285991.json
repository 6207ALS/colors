    "description": "<p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>The Star Domino set replaces typical dots with silkscreened stars used to communicate numbers 0-6. The game's inspiration comes from the pattern's resemblance to Venetian Carnival masks known as&nbsp;Domino, which were white with black spots. A modern visual take on the classic game. Constructed of Baltic Birch, ink, and paper. </span></p><p><span data-sheets-value=&quot;{&quot; data-sheets-userformat=&quot;{&quot;>Wooden case is 3 in. W x 9 in. L x 2 in. H</span></p>",
