The edition was printed in black on fine, grayish-ivory China paper. With a large proportion of absorbent filler used in the formation of the sheets, the paper was particularly conducive to absorbing the black printing ink from the block. Fillers in this type of paper were commonly clay- or chalk-based and had an affinity for the wet, tacky ink. In Pola\u2019s impressions, the ink was wiped very cleanly from the block, with the result that even the most finely incised lines that Gauguin made transferred precisely to paper. This also provides the present-day viewer with a clear understanding of the manufacture of the blocks\u2014constructed by adhering multiple smaller segments of wood together\u2014since many of the small gaps that had developed in them over time appear as fine, white vertical and horizontal lines scattered throughout the impressions. Similarly, the prints document the damage\u2014small scratches and cracks\u2014suffered by the blocks before 1921, as well as minute, delicate incising added by a later hand to clean up the blocks, perhaps in anticipation of the posthumous printing.\n\nWhen placed side by side with the many unique impressions pulled by Gauguin, the impressions pulled by Pola lack tonal variation and differ greatly in appearance. Gauguin sought to obscure much of the gouged and incised detail carved into his blocks by unevenly and selectively inking them and by hand applying media to the block, the printed paper, or both. In contrast, Pola\u2019s impressions have a crisp accuracy and legibility that allow them to be used as road maps to navigate the imagery that was very consciously obscured in Gauguin\u2019s impressions (fig. 51.4.2 and fig. 51.4.3).\n\nSeveral segments of the block used for this print (1893\u201394; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which was constructed from nine small pieces of end-grain boxwood, cracked or shifted out of plane at some point before the 1921 printing. These uninked areas resulted in visual breaks in the printed composition that appear along the top edge at center, horizontally across the width of the impression 118 mm down from the top and 119 mm up from the bottom, and extending 73 mm in from the right and 129 mm up from the bottom.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 51.4.4).\n\nThe posthumous impressions were printed with ink that is a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue. The cool cast of the ink is attributable to the blue pigment. The block was printed in a straightforward manner using a press. This undertaking was carried out in Copenhagen by the publisher Christian Cato, and according to Pola Gauguin the blocks were printed using \u201ca book press and two cylinders, one of moistened rubber and one of hard leather.\u201d It is quite apparent that this impression was printed with a hard leather roller so the ink would remain on the surface of the block rather than slip into the interstices. The consistency of the ink must have been quite tacky to sit on the surface of the block in this way. Because only the hightest points were inked, the rings of the wood absorbed the ink selectively and as such are visible in a section of the print to the right of the figure on the right.\n\nThe paper fibers in the thin, grayish-ivory China paper are more or less uniform, with minute fibrous inclusions throughout. Calcium carbonate (chalk) was used as a filler to give the sheet its opaque, matte appearance and soft, velvety feel. There is a series of brush marks incised into the paper. A hallmark of China paper, these brush marks form when a hard-bristled brush is used to brush out the paper onto a hard surface to dry. Dragging the brush through the chalk-laden paper results in the pattern of brushwork seen here (fig. 51.4.5). In transmitted light, a mold impression characteristic of China paper is visible; chain lines appear at various intervals across the sheet and laid lines are very fine and spaced close together. The distribution of the varied paper fibers is also visible. Under magnification the paper fibers appear long and evenly distributed throughout the sheet. Some darker fibers of various lengths can be seen throughout. The ink is evenly dispersed on the surface. Creases that formed during the printing process are readily visible, and the lack of ink in overlapping areas of creasing is apparent. Embossment of the paper is pronounced in raking light. Pola\u2019s impressions were not printed with the same degree of variable pressure as that applied by Gauguin. As a result, they are not as deeply embossed as the lifetime impressions examined for this study. However, the paper in the image area exhibits pressure-induced undulations associated with the use of a press and the significant pressure exerted in printing the block.\n\nIn 1938 Pola outlined his trials and tribulations as he worked out his method to print his father\u2019s blocks. He stated that he purchased the blocks in 1919, and it must have been under the guidance of the Cato firm that he came to familiarize himself with the China paper favored by printers the world over by the late nineteenth century. Given the nuance and skill required to print such fine impressions, it is inconceivable to the authors that Pola printed the blocks alone, without relying upon the expertise he found in Cato\u2019s firm.\n\n355 \u00d7 205 mm (image); 422 \u00d7 265 mm (sheet). The image was centered on the sheet with substantial borders of approximately 30 mm on each side. The sheet has deckled edges along the right, top, and bottom edges. The left edge was cut with scissors. Along the bottom edge there is residue of red ink of the type customarily used to add export stamps to the outside of large bundled stacks of paper. It is likely that large sheets of China paper were cut into halves or quarters to provide sheets of dimensions appropriate for printing Gauguin\u2019s elongated blocks. For this impression, the printer appears to have cut a large sheet of paper in half.\n\nThe publisher gave careful consideration to the manner of presentation of this group of wood-block prints. The images were centered on the large sheets of China paper with ample borders on all sides. The sheets of China paper were in turn pasted onto sturdy sheets of mottled blue wove paper in each of the four corners (fig. 51.4.6). Blue fibrous inclusions appear throughout (fig. 51.4.7). Ample borders were again provided. The choice of this paper for mounting was not a random one, but one quite common in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It also reflected Gauguin\u2019s own preference for mounting a number of his prints, including some from his Noa Noa Suite and Oviri (see cat. 84.3 and cat. 84.4). Once mounted, the ten prints and a letterpress title page were placed in a portfolio constructed of gray millboard adorned with the cartouche from another plate in the suite, Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), on the cover (fig. 51.4.8).\n\nPosthumous impressions in the Art Institute of Chicago are no longer mounted, the title page (fig. 51.4.9) was trimmed, and only the top of the portfolio cover (fig. 51.4.10) is extant; it too was trimmed.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition overall. In anticipation of this publication, the work was conserved to remove residual hinges and adhesive that had caused the sheet to undulate in the areas where they were adhered. Areas of undulation were locally humidified and flattened. Examination under ultraviolet light reveals extensive foxing throughout on both the recto and verso that is not visible in normal light (see fig. 51.4.1). These areas fluoresce more brightly than the paper.  \nHarriet K.

The means of identification of the wood is not indicated.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis of the ink was carried out using FTIR on Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.5) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.4). Carbon black was identified as likely, and is mixed with Prussian blue. See C\u00e9line Daher, Dec. 2015, XRF analytical results summary, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Although these were the only posthumous prints analyzed, visual examination of multiple examples of posthumous impressions revealed that these works were all printed with the same type of ink. The tonality of the ink and its appearance on the paper are the same in all of them.\n\nElizabeth Mongan, Eberhard W. Kornfeld, and Harold Joachim, Paul Gauguin: Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of His Prints, with assistance of Christine E.

In the essay Pola expands upon what he had written in his 1935 letter to Jean-Gabriel Daragn\u00e8s, published in Arts et m\u00e9tiers graphiques 49 (Oct. 15, 1935), p. 40.\n\nCorrespondence dated April 2014 between Christine Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld) and Sten Rasmussen (buyer of NB Offset A/S and by descent the Cato Lithographic Establishment) states that he acquired a set of Pola impressions from the Cato archives along with the business. A document among Carl Schneiwind\u2019s papers held in the Art Institute of Chicago, Department of Prints and Drawings, states that Pola lived next door to Cato and that \u201cCato probably made [the] Pola ed.\u201d\n\nEdgar Degas owned prints from the Noa Noa Suite that were mounted on mottled blue paper. See Ann Dumas, \u201cDegas and His Collection,\u201d in Dumas, Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, and Gary Tinterow, The Private Collection of Edgar Degas: A Summary Catalogue (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1997), p. 57. An impression of Nave nave fenua mounted on mottled blue paper is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, owns mounted impressions of Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) and Te po (The Night).\n\nIn the Art Institute of Chicago collection there is a portfolio of fifteen lithographs after Degas by Georges William Thornley (1857\u20131935) published by Boussod, Valadon et Cie. that are mounted in a similar fashion. The portfolio cover is intact. See also the Commentary for cat. 51.\n\nAn intact example of the portfolio in the collection of the British Museum, London, was examined for this study. The observations made here are based on that examination.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into Pola Gauguin\u2019s posthumous edition of the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nHarriet Stratis, condition report, 1995, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 51.4 Noa Noa (Fragrant Scent), from the Noa Noa Suite, 1893/94, printed and published 1921\n\nfig. 51.4.2 Left, detail of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa (Fragrant) (1893/94) showing how Gauguin used different types and applications of media to obscure details that he had gouged and carved into the wood-block matrix.
