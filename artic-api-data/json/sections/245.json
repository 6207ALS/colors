Pissarro (lower right, in graphite)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, bequest of Joseph Winterbotham, 1954.337\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">We know with certainty the subject of this quickly executed graphite drawing of an urban scene because Pissarro himself signed and inscribed it in the lower right corner: F\u00eate de la Septembre \u00e0 Pontoise (September Festival at Pontoise; fig. 5.1). This annual festival, commonly called La S\u2019Tembre, dates back to the Middle Ages. On September 8, 1638, for protection against an epidemic then ravaging the town, its citizens pledged a silver statue of the Virgin Mary to the Church of Notre-Dame and placed images of her at the village\u2019s three principal thoroughfares. These efforts proved efficacious, and every year thereafter the residents of Pontoise marked September 8 (also believed to be the Virgin\u2019s birthday) with a procession. On the following days the citizens of neighboring towns, including Enghien-les-Bains, Sartrouville, Montmagny, and Herblay, also paid their respects to the statue. Over the centuries the celebration took on an increasingly fair-like atmosphere. In the nineteenth century it lasted fifteen days and was characterized by games and sales of local agricultural products and crafts.\n\nAlthough Pissarro\u2019s sheet is comparatively slight, the fact that it has been signed and dated indicates that it must have been either sold or, more likely, given away by the artist during his lifetime, perhaps even to someone who witnessed him making it. Pissarro also painted the subject in 1872 (fig. 5.2 [PDRS 266]) and seems to have been joined in his sessions by Clovis-Gaston Cousin, a now-obscure Pontoise-based artist whose painting of the F\u00eate de la Septembre is similar to Pissarro\u2019s (fig. 5.3). Cousin\u2019s painting features the same viewpoint as Pissarro\u2019s, showing the tent-filled church grounds. It is possible that the subject matter was a first for Pissarro, while the treatment of the scene was a departure for the local painter. From what little is known about Cousin\u2019s works, he favored a more classical approach to landscape, depicting scenes from a distance so as to capture all of the elements, both natural and architectural. The relationship between their two paintings is fascinating and might well reveal an as-yet unexplored working friendship between Pissarro and an exclusively regional painter.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s sheet bears no direct connection to Pissarro\u2019s formally composed painting and seems to have been drawn in another, tree-filled section of the festival, perhaps as part of a larger graphic investigation of the fair in preparation for the painting. This may even be the spot where Pissarro met Cousin and possibly where both artists decided to paint the same view of the fairgrounds (see fig. 5.4). Cousin, as a native of Pontoise, perhaps attended the celebration every year, but Pissarro may have influenced him to approach the composition in a more modern way by sharply cutting off the structures on both sides\u2014a typical Impressionist strategy.\n\nSince Pissarro made drawings of this type throughout the later decades of his career, it is difficult to date the sheet on the basis of style. Yet, the fact that he painted the event in 1872 as part of his much-studied topographical series of paintings of Pontoise suggests that the present sheet was made in conjunction with that campaign. The city actually hosted two annual celebrations: the F\u00eate de la Septembre and the Foire de la Saint-Martin (Saint Martin\u2019s Fair), held in November on the Saint-Martin fairground at Saint-Maclou Cathedral, which in the twelfth century replaced an abbey that had been founded in honor of this local saint, also known as Saint Malo (one of the founding saints of Brittany). This festival, even older than the F\u00eate de la Septembre, was more of a market-type fair at which villagers sold goods such as cattle, clothing, and hemp. Pissarro represented this November fair in an 1872 painting (fig. 5.5 [PDRS 276]) and in two additional graphic works titled Foire de la Saint-Martin (fig. 5.6 and fig. 5.7). The present drawing, which is thematically related, must have been executed the same year as his F\u00eate de la Septembre painting (fig. 5.2), as after 1872 there only seem to be representations of Pontoise\u2019s Foire de la Saint-Martin in Pissarro\u2019s oeuvre.\n\nThe sheet appears to have been folded along the top edge, and the presence of numerous small tears and edge losses indicate that it was removed from its former mount. Only the top edge seems to have been trimmed (see Support in the technical report). Perhaps its closest cognate in the published literature is a sheet inscribed Saint-Ouen that comes from a smaller sketchbook made in the early and mid-1870s (partially reconstructed by myself and Christopher Lloyd). Saint-Ouen-l\u2019Aum\u00f4ne is located just south of Pontoise, on the other side of the Oise River, and is much closer than \u00c9ragny, Gisors, or even Osny, the other suburbs associated with Pissarro\u2019s painting campaigns of the 1880s. Thus, on the basis of geographic proximity, the studies representing Saint-Ouen may be linked to Pissarro\u2019s Pontoise works from the early 1870s (fig. 5.8 and fig. 5.9).  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro drew F\u00eate at Pontoise directly with a soft, relatively thick graphite point, without erasure and stumping, on thin, smooth, buff-colored, machine-made paper. The composition is largely composed of deliberate vertical and diagonal graphite strokes, although some curvilinear marks suggest foliage in the background, and a few fine lines establish the foreground. The linear strokes define form and, when closely spaced or hatched, help to distinguish elements of the forms rather than to create volume (fig. 5.10). There is little modeling and the image appears relatively flat. The composition has a strong horizontality due to the generous margins above and below the marks and the fact that the drawing extends fully to both side edges of the paper support.\n\nAlthough the top edge of the sheet is trimmed irregularly, the other three sides do not appear to have been altered after manufacture. The drawn lines that extend to the side edges of the support do not seem to be cut off, which would have suggested that the sheet was trimmed after it was drawn on.\n\nBuff (discolored to tan), thin, smooth, wove paper.\n\nFlecks of dark tan fibers, perhaps derived from wood pulp, are visible throughout.\n\nEven, machine-made.\n\nThe paper support was formerly edge-mounted to gray cardboard or laminated board at its side and bottom edges; board remnants were observed on the verso before treatment (see Condition History). The top edge is trimmed irregularly and there is a pronounced horizontal crease or former fold across the upper margin, just above the composition. There is, however, no evidence of sewing holes to suggest that the sheet was taken from a sketchbook or binding.\n\n226 \u00d7 311 mm.\n\nThe work was drawn directly in graphite. The overall composition was created with a relatively thick (1 mm), soft graphite point, as the drawn lines are broad and dark, and there is little deformation or impression in the paper. There is no evidence of stumping or erasure. No media is visible on the verso.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition under normal conditions or magnification.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV radiation, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in fairly good condition; it was conserved in 2014 for publication. The support was formerly edge-mounted to a gray cardboard or paperboard laminate along the side and bottom edges, indicated by gray board remnants present along the edges on the verso before treatment. The prior removal of the drawing from the cardboard mount caused numerous small edge losses and tears that were repaired during treatment in 2014. The strong horizontal crease across the top margin resulting from former folding of the sheet was also reduced.\n\nThe paper was discolored overall; the edges were lighter in tonality where the paper had been protected from light exposure on the formerly folded top margin and the formerly mounted edges. There were moderate undulations in the lower half of the drawing that likely developed when it was formerly restrained by the mount. A small hole is visible in the lower right area in the graphite inscription.\n\nFaint evidence of blue media is visible at the center right side, perhaps transferred during handling of the drawing. Traces of both blue and green media are visible along the crease across the top margin. A few dark brown spots are also visible throughout the support.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Joseph Winterbotham, Jr. (1878\u20131954), Chicago and Burlington, Vt., by 1936.\n\nBequeathed by Joseph Winterbotham, Jr., Chicago and Burlington, Vt., to the Art Institute, 1954.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Chicago, Arts Club, Exhibition of the Joseph Winterbotham Collection, Dec. 9\u201331, 1936, cat. 63.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Arts Club of Chicago, Exhibition of the Joseph Winterbotham Collection: Loaned by Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Winterbotham ([The Club], 1936), n.p., cat. 63.\n\nHarold Joachim and Sandra Haller Olsen, French Drawings and Sketchbooks of the Nineteenth Century, vol. 2 (University of Chicago Press, 1979), p. 74, no. 4C5.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Signature  \nLocation: lower right area  \nMethod: graphite  \nContent: C.

Although this seems grammatically incorrect (the word \u201cSeptember\u201d is masculine in French), this is not an error; rather, the feminine article may derive from the original French name of the commemoration: La F\u00eate de la Vierge Septembre. For more on the F\u00eate de la Septembre see PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 214\u201315. For additional information on the celebration, see http://www.ville-pontoise.fr/content/fete-stembre. For examples of Pissarro\u2019s hand in his graphic works, see John Rewald et al., Pissarro (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1981), p. 195.\n\nAlthough Pissarro can be placed in the district of L\u2019Hermitage in both 1878 and 1879, he seems to have remained in the rural outskirts of Pontoise, and not in the city itself, where the F\u00eate de la Septembre took place. We can also infer that since no other representations of the F\u00eate de la Septembre have yet been identified in any other medium, we can link the Art Institute\u2019s drawing to Pissarro\u2019s 1872 painting of the fair (fig. 5.2), as this is definitively dated 1872 in PDRS.\n\nFor Clovis-Gaston Cousin, see Bulletin des lois de la r\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise, Xi\u00e8me s\u00e9rie, partie suppl\u00e9mentaire, tome deuxi\u00e8me, nos. 13\u201339 (Imp. Nationale, 1840), p. 819, no. 17. Cousin was older than Pissarro, and it is possible that Pissarro was inspired to paint the fair by this native of Pontoise, who was surely more familiar with its events, as Pissarro does not appear to have revisited the subject. The Mus\u00e9e de Pontoise also holds two other works by Cousin featuring the city of Pontoise: The place Notre-Dame, c. 1860, and View of Pontoise the the Eighteenth Century.\n\nSee Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro and Pontoise (Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 150\u201360, for Pissarro\u2019s Pontoise years in the early 1870s. Pissarro seems to have focused on depicting rural labor in French suburbs like Montfoucault after his Pontoise campaign of the early 1870s, in conjunction with his frequent stays at Piette\u2019s farm. I dated Pissarro\u2019s last Pontoise period to 1879\u201383 in Pissarro and Pontoise, pp. 184\u201399.\n\nThis may confirm that Pissarro\u2019s depictions of Pontoise\u2019s November fair at the Saint-Martin fairground were derived from earlier works and, since additional portrayals of the F\u00eate de la Septembre after 1872 do not seem to exist in the Pissarro literature, the Art Institute\u2019s drawing may also correspond to Pissarro\u2019s early 1870s Pontoise campaign, specifically to his 1872 painting (fig. 5.2). For maps of Pontoise and its surrounding districts, as well as the proximity between the Church of Notre-Dame (where the F\u00eate de la Septembre was held) and the Saint-Maclou Cathedral (associated with Pontoise\u2019s November market fair, the Foire de la Saint-Martin), see PDRS 98 and 101. The Benedictine abbey of Saint-Martin, founded in the late eleventh century, was replaced by Saint-Maclou Cathedral in the twelfth century.\n\nThree other variations of these November festivities appear in PDRS, vol. 2, p. 219: one etching, one lithograph, and one earthenware decoration. It seems that the earthenware version was directly derived from Pissarro\u2019s 1872 painting (PDRS 276), even down to the two men having a discussion in the middle ground.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, p. 219. See also PV, vol. 1, pp. 268, 271, 273, 303, 310, and PV 1348, 1372, 1387, 1618, 1668. PV 1668\u2014an earthenware decoration and the last item listed in the catalogue\u2014resembles almost exactly the cityscape in the distance and all the elements in Pissarro\u2019s lithograph in fig. 5.6. There is an even later representation of the Saint-Martin fair dated 1886, entitled The Pig Market, the Fair of Saint-Martin, Pontoise. See John Rewald et al., Pissarro (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1981), p. 179. Pissarro\u2019s latest depiction of the Saint-Martin fair is dated 1891, a pastel listed as PV 1592. These late representations (the 1886 drawing and the 1891 pastel) also suggest that Pissarro possibly reworked his later Foire de la Saint-Martin works from the late 1870s and early 1880s based on his earlier stays, which were centered around the town\u2019s festivities, as is evident from his two paintings from 1872 (fig. 5.2 and fig. 5.5). See also Barbara S. Shapiro, Camille Pissarro: The Impressionist Printmaker (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1973), pl. 5. Pissarro\u2019s 1878 drypoint of the same woman selling chestnuts in his 1881 gouache (PV 1348) and his 1891 pastel (PV 1592) indicate that he at least once reworked a subject from the 1870s in the following decades, during a period when he was representing market scenes in Gisors, an area removed from Pontoise.\n\nThis sheet is cat. 99A recto in Sketchbook IX.
