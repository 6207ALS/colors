She was inspired by the foliage she found on her walks in the summer around Lake George in upstate New York. Although she represented the leaves with carefully realistic handling, the close focus underscores their abstract qualities. She hoped that the strangely monumental subjects would inspire viewers to, as she said, \u201cbe surprised into taking time to look\u201d at them in a new way.</p>\n",
