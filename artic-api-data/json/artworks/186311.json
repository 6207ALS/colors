    "description": "<p>Menzel often chose to depict complex social situations, no doubt to test his powers of observation. From the absolute concentration on the gamblers\u2019 faces to the grimace of the screaming child, he captured a wide range of emotions. His attention to the setting is equally exacting, as evidenced by the meticulous still life on the far table. The artist\u2019s technique here is as sophisticated as his sense of observation. To create an illusion of smoke, for instance, he applied chalk and then scraped areas away. Menzel was known for always having one of his sketchbooks on hand. Reportedly, in order to carry them more easily, he had special, large pockets added to his coats.</p>\n",
