    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:   This carved image of Christ crucified dates from around 1390. Christina Nielsen, Assistant Curator for Medieval Art.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN: The piece is relatively small in size, yet very monumental in its effect. The pain and agony that Christ suffered during crucifixion is dramatically emphasized here with the taut musculature, Christ's distended stomach, the legs which bow out but also curve in at the knee, and you see the very ripply muscles both on his abdomen but particularly in his upturned forearms. And his head is clearly drooping to one side and he is dying if not already dead. And this heightened emphasis on the suffering of Christ encouraged devout Christians to think of themselves in imitation of Christ when they also suffered pain or physical anguish.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The figure was made by a celebrated medieval artist, Jacques de Baerze, for the Duke of Burgundy who then controlled the low countries and large parts of Eastern France. It was once surrounded by other carved figures as the central focus of a large altarpiece. The figures were originally painted to make them appear more lifelike. You can still see white on Christ's stomach and arms and gold on his loincloth.</p>\n<p>CHRISTINA NIELSEN: If you imagine the altar panels being viewed under candlelight with painted sculpture, it would have almost had the effect of the works being alive.</p>\n",
