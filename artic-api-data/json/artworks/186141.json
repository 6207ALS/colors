Soon the hotel had four stars and a thriving business. When two of the managers were fired, all three moved to a trailer in the nearby seaside village of Findhorn. There they grew vegetables, including legendary forty-pound cabbages, and their garden became a matter of myth. Around them arose the Findhorn Foundation, a flourishing spiritual and educational center with more than three hundred members\u2014and sufficient enrollees for its courses to warrant purchasing the Cluny Hill Hotel.\n\nSirius Community was founded by three former members of the Findhorn Foundation, who hoped to create a similar environment in the United States. Not only has Sirius become a spiritual center, but the community, which strives to embody \u201cthe new planetary consciousness that honors the interconnectedness and sacredness of all living things,\u201d is an aspiring ecovillage as well.\n\nAn ecovillage is \u201ca vision, an ideal, a goal,\u201d but as Tony Sirna notes in the Communities Directory, there are really no examples of fully realized ecovillages now except for some aboriginal communities. Generally speaking, ecovillages are committed to sustainability, which implies an ongoing and future-oriented dedication to living in concert with nature. Typically small (\u201chuman scale\u201d), they can exist in urban as well as rural areas\u2014even a few miles from downtown L.A., where the Los Angeles Ecovillage carries out an extensive and admired program. While honoring \u201cthe highest truths common to all religions,\u201d Sirius also generates electricity using solar and wind power, runs vehicles powered by vegetable oil, and builds environmentally friendly buildings, including one of the largest cob houses in America (an ancient and incredibly durable building method employing a hardened mixture of clay, sand, and straw).\n\nThe community is named after the brightest star in the sky.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
