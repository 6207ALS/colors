    "description": "<p>British artist Elizabeth Price (born 1966) talks about her videos, which often showcase her ability to manifest the drama of historical artifacts, archival images, and documents through an institutional and feminist critique. Her sensitivity to video\u2019s sensuousness as a medium is apparent through the two multichannel videos, <em>K</em> and <em>A Restoration</em>, which were both recently acquired by the museum. To create the hypnotic, commercial-like narrative of <em>K</em>, Price combined CGI animated nylon stockings, stop-frame animations of the sun, factory noises, and a synthetic voice-over. For <em>A Restoration</em>, Price used the collections and archives of the Ashmolean and Pitt Rivers museums in Oxford to map an unsettling digital landscape of contemporary culture.</p><p>Both video works are on view in the Donna and Howard Stone Gallery for Film, Video, and New Media, October 11\u2013January 7, 2018.</p>",
