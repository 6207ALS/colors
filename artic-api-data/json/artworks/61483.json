    "description": "<p>This modest cottage nestled at the foot of towering mountains presents a quintessential image of academic retreat from the \u201cdusty\u201d world of material concerns and political instabilities. Its cultured occupant kneels on a platform and plays the zither (<em>qin</em>); a book lies open before him and young servants wait attentively nearby. The luxuriant setting of layered peaks and intertwined trees, as well as the dry, charcoal- like treatment of fibrous and dotted boulders, is imbued with a textural richness. This style is closely associated with Wang Meng, the last of the \u201cFour Great Masters\u201d of the Yuan dynasty.</p>\n<p>Such a complex, kinetic composition reflects this artist's distinctive contribution to the literati's new use of painting as a vehicle for intellectual and emotional self-expression.  This concept was largely kindled by social and political upheavals that accompanied the 14th-century Mongol conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Wang Meng, who had served the Mongol government as a legal scribe, retired to a mountain hermitage in the turbulent final decades of Yuan rule. He may have executed this painting as a metaphorical self-portrait.</p>\n",
