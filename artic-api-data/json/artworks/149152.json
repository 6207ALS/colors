The nine-story Alfred Murrah Federal Building housed seventeen government agencies and a day-care center. At 9:02 A.M., a truck containing more than two tons of fertilizer and fuel oil exploded next to the building, killing 168 people, 15 of them small children. At least 600 others were injured in the blast. \n\nThe FBI arrested Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols for the bombing. McVeigh, a former Army sergeant, and Nichols, a former member of a paramilitary group known as the Michigan Militia, had spoken about their desire to seek revenge for the attack by the United States Government on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, which had occurred two years earlier. Both men pleaded not guilty.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
