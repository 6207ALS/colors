    "description": "<p>Noted sculptor Lorado Taft was born and educated in Illinois and received additional training in sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris between 1880 and 1883. Returning to Illinois, Taft began teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago. Taft\u2019s first major commission was to design sculptures for the influential World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and his work was exhibited there to great acclaim. Known particularly for his monumental outdoor sculptures, often with water features, Taft worked, taught, and lectured about art throughout his career. This collection contains two typed copies of a lecture given by Taft and mounted photographs of five of Taft\u2019s sculptures, including the Fountain of Time in Chicago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Taft,%20Lorado,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
