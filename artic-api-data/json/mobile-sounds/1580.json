    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Edgar Degas was fascinated by Parisian millinery shops with their lavish displays of colorful hats and their elegant shop girls and customers. This young woman who\u2019s inspecting a hat at arm\u2019s length might possibly be a client, but it\u2019s perhaps more likely a shop assistant. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: If indeed the young woman is a milliner working her craft, the hat that she\u2019s working on seems not to have been finished. The whole question of finished and unfinished-- in other words, when the picture was completed-- was something that was very close to Degas\u2019 practice and even in this picture some of the other hats that are on the stands seem less finished than the blue hat and the pink hat with the gold ribbon and that wonderful hat with green ribbon. What\u2019s also interesting though in terms of the ambiguity in this picture is Degas identification with the whole milliner theme, because Degas was born into an affluent banking family. However, as an artist he, like the milliners, spent his time creating things with his hands and using materials. And I think that this picture is, in a way, a metaphor for many of the issues that Degas was confronting himself as an artist.</p>\n",
