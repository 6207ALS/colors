Over the years, she has created series of drawings in various media that extend her painting ideas but also exist as independent bodies of work.  Always focused on her immediate environment, Fish creates drawings based on memories and observations of the conditions in her garden and the physical properties of her house\u2019s interior and exterior. She employs media to evoke\u2014rather than mimic\u2014physicality, touch, and time, as seen here.</p>\n",
