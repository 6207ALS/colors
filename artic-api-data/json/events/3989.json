    "description": "<p>Nicolai Remisoff (1884-1975) led a colorful life as an artist and designer. He trained in his native Russia, fled the country after the Russian Revolution, and worked as a theater designer in Paris and New York. Settling in Chicago in 1925, Remisoff designed opera and ballet productions and painted murals in public buildings in the Chicago area before moving to California, where he worked on Hollywood films and television. Our speaker Jeff Nigro is an art historian, lecturer, and educator. Jeff has had a professional relationship with the Art Institute of Chicago for more than 28 years, first as a staff lecturer, later as Director of Adult Programs in the Department of Museum Education. Currently, Jeff is a Research Associate and Coordinator of the Boshell Foundation Lecture Series for the Department of Ancient and Byzantine Art.
