    "description": "<p>Join ceramic specialist Namwon Jang for a discussion of the Goryeo celadons from the Art Institute\u2019s collection currently on view in the Korean galleries.</p><p>The practice of drinking tea was brought to the Korean peninsula from Tang China (618\u2013907) and widely spread in the Goryeo court and Buddhist temples. When ceramicists in the region began making teaware with Goryeo celadon, the objects were not only functional but rare. They acquired new material value and a reputation as objects of taste. In this talk, Jang will discuss how the celadon produced during the Goryeo dynasty (918\u20131392) reflects the material culture of Goryeo society and its international relationships with China and Japan.</p><p>The discussion will be held in Korean and live-translated into English.</p><p><em>This program is generously funded by the National&nbsp;Museum of Korea.</em></p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p><strong>Namwon Jang</strong> is a professor of Korean and Asian ceramic history at Ewha Womans University and the director of Ewha Womans University Museum, Korea.
