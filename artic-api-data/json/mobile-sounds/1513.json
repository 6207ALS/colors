    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  If you read the label for this silver set, the first question you might ask is, &quot;What does that name mean? The Geneva Tribunal Testimonial.&quot; The Art Institute's Ellen Roberts explains.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: Well the history of this is very interesting. After the Civil War in 1871, the Americans actually sued the British to get war reparations from them. Because they accused them of helping the Confederacy during the war, and thus prolonging the war. So they brought that case in front of three neutral arbitrators from Brazil, Switzerland and Italy. And so they came to Geneva in Switzerland and they met, and they decided that the British were indeed at fault, and that they would need to pay the Americans 15 million dollars in war reparations. So in gratitude for that, the Americans commissioned three identical sets of silver from Tiffany and Company.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Among the figures on the silver set is Dionysus, the Greek god of wine.</p>\n<p>ELLEN ROBERTS: The center punch bowl has on it heads of Dionysus as the handles. On the wine coolers themselves you see the head of Silenus, who is Dionysus's most famous follower. The candlesticks have the figure of Ariadne, wife of Dionysus. Also on the wine coolers, each one has two mythological figures, one representing agriculture and the other representing commerce.</p>\n",
