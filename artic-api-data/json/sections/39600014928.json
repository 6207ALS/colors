In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 56.1, fig. 56.2, and fig. 56.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in c. 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see fig. 56.4) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin (see cat. 56.1, cat. 56.2, and cat. 56.3) and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. The analysis that follows of what the print depicts relies on a 1921 impression (cat. 56.4), which conveys all of the information that Gauguin inscribed and carved into the woodblock. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nThe title of the sixth plate in the Noa Noa series, Nave nave fenua, means \u201cdelicious land.\u201d The French title, L\u2019\u00eele d\u00e9licieuse, most likely derives from the writer Pierre Loti, who used this phrase several times to describe Tahiti in his autobiographical novel Rarahu, or Le mariage de Loti. Published in Paris in 1879, the book gained critical acclaim and a large readership, including Gauguin. Unlike the majority of prints in the Noa Noa Suite, which are amalgams of motifs that Gauguin drew from multiple sources, both from his art and elsewhere, Nave nave fenua derives from a single image, the artist\u2019s spring 1892 painting of the same title (fig. 56.5 [W 455]). It featured in the Durand-Ruel exhibition but did not sell. Reversed by the printing process, the image in the wood-block print is reduced, modified, and embellished with various decorations.\n\nIn the print, a woman stands, flowers behind her right ear, with her right arm bent and holding a twig or grass stem and her left extended to touch a flower resembling the \u201ceye\u201d of a peacock feather. In the middle ground, separated from the figure by a rivulet, is a tree trunk, behind which rise tall trees. Running along the left side of the image is a decorative band filled with Marquesan-inspired designs. The artist\u2019s monogram, PGo, features at the bottom. Above the scene, a masthead contains the print\u2019s title. Evil intrudes upon this Edenic setting in the form of a flying lizard that hovers beside the woman. Its presence reveals the scene to be a Polynesian version of the biblical Fall of Man and the woman to be a Tahitian Eve, an Eve more \u201cancient\u201d and \u201csavage,\u201d as the artist informed the Swedish playwright August Strindberg, than her Western counterpart.\n\nThe facial features of the nude in the painting have been related to those of Gauguin\u2019s mistress, the teen-aged Tehamana, a nubile Tahitian girl\u2014probably much like one captured in a vintage erotic photograph (fig. 56.6)\u2014whom he transformed here into a monumental embodiment of Eve. While she is Polynesian in appearance, she also embodies Asian and Judeo-Christian traditions. The artist appropriated her pose from an albumen print he had owned since 1889 that was part of a collection of assorted visuals he constantly consulted (see cat. 52, Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). The photograph, by Isidore van Kinsbergen, shows a panel, carved into volcanic rock, that adorns a ninth-century Buddhist temple at Borobudur, in central Java (fig. 56.7). It depicts Maitrakanyaka welcomed by apsaras (nymphs), his body swaying sinuously, his left arm bent and right arm extended to pick fruit off a nearby tree. This figural type features in work by Gauguin that predates his first trip to the South Seas: a stoneware figure whose topknot betrays its Asian origins (fig. 56.8 [Gray 15]) and a painting (fig. 56.9 [W 389]) showing the biblical Eve in Paradise about to take the forbidden apple offered by a snake (the composition\u2019s vertical format and luxuriant setting also foreshadow the print Nave nave fenua), as well as work made during his first Tahitian stay: a relief at the back of a carved wood head (fig. 56.10 [Gray 98]). Significantly, the head of the painted Eve closely resembles that of Gauguin\u2019s mother as seen in a photograph (fig. 56.11). The body of the female in the painting Te nave nave fenua extends the entire height of the composition, which seems barely to contain her. In the wood-block print, she is more generously accommodated in the setting, much as Maitrakanyaka is in the ancient relief.\n\nUnderscoring the relationship between Eve and nature is the twig or grass stem in her right hand, coupled with the action of her left hand\u2014in the painting it holds a flower; in the print, it touches the flower. A vintage photograph shows a Tahitian woman holding a tool described as a \u201cstylet\u201d (stylus) and the flower of a vanilla orchid plant (fig. 56.12). The photograph illustrates a critical aspect of growing the vanilla orchid (Tahiti abounded in vanilla plantations): the most effective pollination of the vanilla blossom was done by hand using a twig, stem, or other tool to dust the pollen of one of the flower\u2019s stamens to its stigma. While in neither the painting nor the woodcut is Eve actually \u201cmarrying the vanilla,\u201d as the practice was called, the movement of her arms and contents of her hands could suggest it, thus linking her to fertility.\n\nThe biblical Temptation of Eve involves a snake and an apple, neither of which was native to Tahiti. According to Rarahu, Loti\u2019s mistress in his above-mentioned novel, Christian missionaries described the biblical snake as \u201ca long lizard without feet.\u201d The lizard in Gauguin\u2019s painted images features brilliant red wings. The wings add mass and movement to the lizard\u2019s form, underscoring its aggressive intrusion into the scene. The motif of a flying creature bringing temptation to an innocent human has been related to an image by Odilon Redon with which Gauguin was probably familiar. An illustration for Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony is aptly captioned \u201cAnd a Large Bird that Descends from the Sky Hurls Itself on Top of Her Hair\u201d (fig. 56.13).\n\nThe flora in the painting differs significantly from that in the print. Instead of the former\u2019s richly foliaged poison-fish tree (see fig. 56.14) and glimpse of an adjacent breadfruit tree (see fig. 56.15), the wood-block print features a stunted, forked stump, partly obscured by the flying lizard. The space above the woman and lizard contains abstracted vegetal forms, the edges of some shredded from the effect of wind and rain. From left to right, we see vegetation that might be the leaf of the breadfruit tree; a coconut palm (see fig. 56.16); a banana tree (see fig. 56.17); and an ironwood tree, with its distinctive cascades of fuzzy, needle-like foliage (see fig. 56.18). Set against a reserve of white that suggests billowing clouds, the foliage seems to sway restlessly in the breeze, which, like the tree stump, possibly signals trouble. The form of the plant in the lower-right corner may have derived from that of the coastal lily (see fig. 56.19).\n\nThe only botanical feature shared by the painting and print is the plant in the foreground, with its peacock-feather-eye blossoms. Most writers have concluded that this flower is entirely the product of Gauguin\u2019s imagination. However, Gauguin must have been familiar with the peacock plant. As discussed in Scented Sites, this plant featured in the foreground of the now-lost painting Noa Noa (Scented Sites, fig. 3), although it was not shown in bloom. Three of the six petals of the peacock blossom each bear a dark, blotchy shape (see fig. 56.20). Thus, it is possible that, in designing this element, the artist was thinking of a single petal of this flower.\n\nThe horizontal masthead and the vertical band at the left suggest a carved window- or doorframe through which the viewer observes the scene. The decorations on the latter derive from rubbings that Gauguin made of designs adorning Marquesan carved wood objects such as clubs, bowls, and coconut containers that he found in Tahiti. The artist made rubbings of such objects. He cut out two such rubbings, done with graphite on paper, and then selectively heightened with watercolor, and pasted one along the left side, like the vertical element in the woodcut, on page 169 (folio 89R) of his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti. Gauguin reserved this page for the beginning of chapter 11, which is titled \u201cNave nave fenua\u201d (fig. 56.21).\n\nGauguin made a to-scale preparatory drawing for Te nave nave fenua in 1892. It was pricked for transfer to the canvas (fig. 56.22 [Rewald 56, Pickvance 61]). He reworked this drawing around 1894. Predating the painting and print is a delicate 1892\u201393 rendition of a woman holding a flower stem between her fingers and a red-winged lizard in a landscape (fig. 56.23 [Rewald 58, Pickvance 62]). Here Gauguin revealed his illustrative skills by breaking up solid areas of paint with an overlay of colorful dots, which can be seen as an amusing send-up of Pointillism, a style he did not esteem. The artist was obsessed with his Tahitian Eve throughout 1894 and beyond. In addition to reworking the to-scale preparatory study mentioned above, in 1894 he portrayed the head of a woman in profile with the lizard at the upper left (fig. 56.24 [Pickvance 78]) and executed a charcoal drawing in which the female is the focus and the winged lizard and landscape are articulated only minimally (fig. 56.25 [Rewald 60]). The latter served as a matrix for three very different watercolor transfer monotypes (fig. 56.26 [Field 1973 6]), fig. 56.27, fig. 56.28 [Field 1973 7]). Also from 1894 is a version in gouache and ink (fig. 56.29 [Rewald 59, Pickvance IX]). In 1891/93 Gauguin had drawn his Tahitian Eve with her arms in a slightly different position (fig. 56.30), mirroring that of the standing Buddha in another section of the Borobudur relief photographed by Van Kinsbergen (see fig. 56.31). The final appearance of this figure occurs at the right of a late wood-block print, Woman, Animals, and Foliage, of 1898/99 (fig. 56.32 [cat. 97.2]). In these works, Gauguin often played with the position of Eve\u2019s head and the direction of her gaze, shifting it slightly. For example, in the painting and wood-block print Nave nave fenua, she turns her head slightly to the left, glancing away from the lizard. In the gouache and ink drawing (fig. 56.29), the direction of her head aligns with that of her body, but she eyes the lizard. And in her final appearance in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre (fig. 56.34; see below), her head turns to the right, and she looks at the lizard.\n\nIn addition to pasting a watercolor Nave nave fenua\u2014which reverses the image of the painting and which possibly dates to 1894 like so many other versions of the subject\u2014onto page 69 (folio 39R) of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 56.33), Gauguin adhered onto the suede front cover of this manuscript a detail, in gouache, showing just the woman\u2019s head and the winged lizard (fig. 56.34). Their placement at the top of the front cover of this important undertaking is not surprising: for Gauguin these two protagonists were the central elements of the story of the Fall of Man, signaling the struggle between innocence and corruption, good and evil. They lie as well at the heart of the artist\u2019s experience in Tahiti, where he sought an idyllic existence but found instead a paradise lost.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">This print is closely based upon an eponymous picture, Te nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (fig. 56.35 [W 455, Field 1977 33]), which Gauguin painted in 1892 in Tahiti. When the painting was exhibited in November 1893 at Durand-Ruel in Paris, its title was correctly translated in the catalogue as Terre d\u00e9licieuse. In this wood-block print, it is spelled Navenave fenua and inscribed in capital letters on a masthead occupying the top of the composition; this, together with the vertical format, suggests that the plate marks a shift within the Noa Noa series.\n\nOn the left side, a decorative band completes this asymmetrical frame by running the whole length of the block. Alternating white-on-black and black-on-white parts, it comprises freely interpreted, ornamental patterns known from Marquesan tattoos and carvings (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). Gauguin\u2019s monogram, PGo, finds its place at the bottom, emphasizing the cryptographic quality of these quasi-signs and integrating the artist\u2019s persona into the original Polynesian culture he was seeking. The most remarkable motif (fig. 56.36) is situated alongside the upper torso of the female figure, from hip to shoulder, and derives from the \u201ctikigenic\u201d patterns that form the main basis of Marquesan ornament. Around an ipu (\u201ccontainer\u201d) sign (see cat. 53, Commentary, fig. 53.46), turned to the left, a small head extends upward its nose or arm, which morphs into another head\u2014also facing left\u2014with a prominent lower jaw (or arm). There can be no doubt that Gauguin, who would later praise the Marquesans\u2019 \u201csense of decoration\u201d and observe that \u201cone is astonished to find a face where one thought there was nothing but a strange geometric figure,\u201d intended an iconic interpretation of this kind to be possible. On a perceptual level, the latency and dynamism of this double-headed monster adds to the sense of danger closing in upon Tahitian Eve, all the more as the eye and member of its upper part rhyme with those of the flying lizard approaching her.\n\nThe identity of the main figure can be determined with the help of earlier versions of the same theme, such as the 1890 Exotic Eve (fig. 56.37 [W 389]), from which it follows that the tropical \u201cland of delights\u201d represents the garden of Eden. Henri Dorra demonstrated that Gauguin\u2019s \u201cexotic Eve\u201d displays the facial features of the artist\u2019s deceased mother (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), and a charcoal study for Te nave nave fenua shows they were replaced by those of his young Tahitian mistress Teha\u2018amana. When Te nave nave fenua was exhibited in Paris, the painting elicited much comment. One of Gauguin\u2019s defenders, Achille Delaroche, described it as follows: \u201cThere a fantastic orchard offers its insidious blossoms to the desire of an Edenic Eve, whose arm is extended timorously to pluck the flower of evil, while the red wings of the Chimera flutter about her forehead.\u201d But less favorable critics went so far as to reproach the artist for depicting the Tahitian woman as \u201ca female quadrumane.\u201d Gauguin responded that the Eve of his choice was \u201calmost an animal,\u201d which enabled her to be \u201cchaste, although naked,\u201d whereas all the Venuses exhibited at the Salon (see fig. 56.38) were \u201cindecent, obnoxiously lewd.\u201d In Te nave nave fenua, he had indeed departed from European conventions of female beauty in a way that could be perceived to emphasize animality, but he also rooted his Eve firmly in her tropical garden, like the plants surrounding her, even including the unusual anatomical detail\u2014absent or not visible in the print\u2014of a polydactyl foot with two tiny extra toes.\n\nThe other protagonist of the scene is not a snake, as in the biblical source (Genesis 3) and in Exotic Eve, but a fantastic creature generally identified as a winged lizard. Ziva Amishai-Maisels pointed out that in Pierre Loti\u2019s 1879 novel Le mariage de Loti (first published as Rarahu: Idylle polyn\u00e9sienne), the Tahitian girl Rarahu, worried that she will be betrayed, calls her French lover a \u201clong lizard without feet\u201d because the mestizo woman who had raised her said that Eve was tempted by a lizard, there being no snakes in Tahiti. Lizards, some of them arboreal, were feared in Polynesia because of their disquieting \u201cvoice\u201d and their way of falling on a prey; they were regarded as spirits (of ancestors or divinities), and their image was used apotropaically. The lizard therefore seems a fitting replacement for the snake of Genesis, although it does not play this role in the first translation of the Bible in Tahitian, by Henry Nott, who introduced instead for this purpose the Greek-based neologism ophi. With its wings and menacing claws, Gauguin\u2019s lizard has also been compared to the dragons and monsters found in temptation and infernal scenes such as Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s Harrowing of Hell (fig. 56.39) and Rembrandt van Rijn\u2019s Adam and Eve (fig. 56.40). Yet its large red wings have an elegance absent from these grotesque antecedents, pointing rather to other sources such as Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s Mephistopheles Flying, from the suite of lithographic illustrations he did in 1828 for Goethe\u2019s Faust (fig. 56.41), and \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s illustration for St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s version of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s poem \u201cThe Raven\u201d (fig. 56.42). This bird of ill omen was dear to Gauguin\u2019s heart (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d), but Delacroix\u2019s Mephistopheles brings us closer to the Devil, instigator of Adam and Eve\u2019s expulsion from Paradise.\n\nThe Fall of Man was an important theme for Gauguin, who was raised a Catholic and who consistently objected to the sexual morality of the Church. From the time of its discovery by Europeans, Tahiti had been described and fantasized as an Earthly Paradise, and Gauguin did not see it differently when he envisioned moving there. Since Denis Diderot\u2019s Suppl\u00e9ment au Voyage de Bougainville of 1772, Tahiti had also been used to criticize monogamy and private property, in the name of the \u201claws of nature,\u201d and to denounce the destruction of natural societies at the hands of colonists and missionaries. For Diderot the Tempters who had introduced the seeds of death into the Earthly Paradise were Bougainville himself (by taking possession of the land); the sailors who had infected Tahitian women with syphilis; and the priests who perverted the island\u2019s youth, forbidding them to \u201creproduce themselves without shame, in the face of heaven and in plain sight.\u201d Commenting again on his depictions of Tahitian women in 1896\u201397, Gauguin described them as \u201cEve after the Fall, still able to go about unclothed without being immodest, still with as much animal beauty as on the very first day.\u201d \u201cEve after the Fall\u201d is more explicitly represented in paintings like Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 56.43 [W 458]), in which a Polynesian Eve places her hand over her pudenda like the Medici Venus, and Nave nave fenua shows her immediately before the Fall, but Gauguin\u2019s comment is generic and suggests that his Tahitian Eve will remain unaffected.\n\nGauguin based Eve\u2019s pose on those of Buddhist figures on reliefs of the Borobudur temple complex, especially that of the Indian merchant Maitrakanyaka picking fruit from a tree while being greeted by nymphs (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 56.7). This provenance confers on her a dignity that, together with the satanic grandeur of the flying lizard, suggests Gauguin\u2019s meditation on the biblical narrative may have been informed by one of its most elaborate commentaries, John Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost (1667). We know that, while in Brittany, Gauguin was introduced by his friend Jacob Meyer de Haan to the epic poem in 1889 (at the latest). He represented De Haan in a tortured pose in front of a lamp with copies of Milton\u2019s book and Thomas Carlyle\u2019s Sartor Resartus (1836) and a plate of apples, traditionally used to represent the forbidden fruit of Eden (see fig. 56.44 [W 317]). Whether he read it himself or relied on De Haan, Gauguin had many reasons to enjoy Paradise Lost. Milton\u2019s Satan shows a psychological complexity that must have appealed to the artist, who represented himself as a suffering tempter of women (see fig. 56.45 [Gray 76]). The \u201crites / Mysterious of connubial love\u201d are observed by Adam and Eve before the Fall and eloquently defended: \u201cWhatever hypocrites austerely talk / Of purity and place and innocence.\u201d Eve misguidedly trusts the serpent, which, possessed by the Devil, claims to have received the gift of speech by eating of the forbidden fruit and to prove thereby that this fruit does not kill but enlightens. Nonetheless, despite her error and even after the Fall, Eve maintains a dignity befitting the \u201cmother of mankind.\u201d\n\nWhen Satan approaches Eve in Paradise Lost, he finds her \u201cveiled in a cloud of fragrance,\u201d for she is busy propping up \u201cgently with myrtle band\u201d the drooping heads of roses (see fig. 56.46). Rather than being close to the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, as is usual in depictions of the Temptation, the Tahitian Eve of Nave nave fenua holds a flower in her left hand and a twig or grass stem in her right one. It has been suggested, in the absence of apples and snakes in Tahiti, that the flower replaced the apple as the lizard replaced the serpent. Stephen Eisenman proposed to relate Eve\u2019s gesture to the pollination of vanilla orchid plants effected by women working at the island\u2019s numerous plantations (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). This gesture and the scene could, however, equally refer to the moment of encounter between Eve and Satan in Milton\u2019s narration, all the more as in the painting Te nave nave fenua, she clasps the flower stalk with one hand and holds no object in the other. Alternatively, Gauguin may have combined the two references and made the one to \u201cmarrying the vanilla\u201d more explicit in the print by adding the twig.\n\nIn any event, the flowers tended by Eve resemble peacock feathers. They may derive from the peacock plant (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), but their suggestion of eyes is paramount, as an earlier apparition in Gauguin\u2019s 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) shows (fig. 56.47). Here two feathers mirror the contest about mortality between Tefatu, who wants humans to die, and Hina, who wants them to live again (see cat. 53, Commentary). In Nave nave fenua, their gaze, highlighted in blue in a hand-colored impression (cat. 56.1), suggests the striving for a higher state of being associated with the Tree of Knowledge. The motif of the flower-eye, cultivated by Gauguin until his death, had an important prototype in Odilon Redon\u2019s lithograph Il y eut peut-\u00eatre une vision premi\u00e8re essay\u00e9e dans la fleur (There Was Perhaps a First Vision Attempted in the Flower) (fig. 56.48), part of an evocation of the genesis of life inspired by science more than by the Bible (see cat. 54, Commentary).\n\nSimilarly, Gauguin\u2019s Eve is an integral part of nature, which is understood as a never-ending process. This is underscored by the dynamism of her surroundings. Peter Zegers proposes to identify the trees forming the background of Nave nave fenua with precision (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), but Gauguin\u2019s contemporaries perceived its flora as fantastic. This may owe something to their lack of familiarity with tropical plants, but it is certainly also due to the animation of the landscape, which reaches a climax in an impression printed twice and off-register (cat. 56.3). The drama created by the silhouettes of the trees is impressive enough in a pure black-and-white impression (fig. 56.49), which bears an inscription on the verso (fig. 56.50) stating that the print was pulled by the artist \u201cin a most primitive way, putting his weight on his bed.\u201d The agitation of the trees may refer to the impending disaster, true to the biblical scenario and to Milton, who mentioned the \u201cstorm so nigh.\u201d Or their explosive conquest of the sky may express the untamable fecundity of tropical nature. In his 1903 manuscript Diverses choses (Various Things), Gauguin replied to the critics of his 1893 exhibition that he had wanted \u201cto suggest a luxuriant and untamed type of nature\u201d and that Tahiti was \u201can immense palace decorated by nature itself.\u201d  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor. The three buyers were Michel Manzi, who purchased Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary) (1891; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W 428]); Edgar Degas, who bought Hina tefatou (Moon and Earth) (1893; Museum of Modern Art, New York [W 499]); and Wilhelm Hansen, who acquired Vahine no tiare (Flower Woman) (1891; Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen [W 420]).

There is a contemporary description of Gauguin\u2019s studio:\n\nAu fond, \u00e9tait un hangar vitr\u00e9, comportant un rez-de-chaus\u00e9e et deux \u00e9tages. En haut de l\u2019escalier, \u00e0 la hauteur de second, un balcon desservait trois ateliers. Le troisi\u00e8me et dernier de ceux-ci, au bout de balcon, \u00e9tait celui de Gauguin. . . . Au bout de l\u2019antichambre se trouvait l\u2019atelier. . . . Cette assez vaste pi\u00e8ce, enti\u00e8rement peinte en jaune de chrome clair\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014donnait la sensation imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019\u00e9trange et de l\u2019impr\u00e9vue. Sur les murs, balafr\u00e9s de toiles barbares. (At the back was a kind of windowed shed with a ground floor and two upper stories. At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . . An entrance space led to the studio. . . . This rather vast room, painted entirely in bright chrome yellow\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014created an immediate impression of strangeness and unpredicatability. On the walls, smeared with barbaric canvases.)\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin, 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), pp. 123\u201324. Colta Ives identified the man at the lower-left corner of the photo as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten wood-block prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the woodcuts do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.

Maurice Malingue (B. Grasset, 1946), pp. 262\u201364. Gauguin had asked Strindberg to contribute the preface for the catalogue for his February 18, 1895, sale at the H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, but Strindberg refused, writing to Gauguin about his dislike of the artist\u2019s work. Gauguin decided to publish the letter as the preface. The sixth plate of the suite may have been intended to introduce chapter 9 of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, since it includes a prose poem by Charles Morice entitled \u201cNave nave fenua\u201d that Gauguin copied into the manuscript (fols. 89V\u00ad\u201389R [paginated pp. 169\u201370]). Interestingly, that poem does not reference Eve but instead mentions Hina, the Tahitian moon goddess.\n\nSee Charles F. Stuckey with Peter Zegers, \u201cTe nave nave fenua,\u201d in Richard R.

Tehamana (also known as Tehura) was some three decades younger than Gauguin and close in age to his only daughter, Aline, who in 1892 was fifteen. The French photographer Charles-George Spitz was a contemporary of Gauguin who worked in Tahiti. The artist based the 1893 painting Pape moe (Mysterious Water) ([W 498]) on one of Spitz\u2019s photographs.\n\nThe albumen print appeared in Isidore van Kinsbergen, Oudheden van Java: De temple ruine van Boro-Boedoer (Batavia, [1874]), pl. 57/58.

See Gamboni, Paul Gauguin: The Mysterious Centre of Thought, trans. Chris Miller (Reaktion Books, 2014), p. 273.\n\nThe reference to peacock-feather-inspired flowers originated with Gauguin\u2019s collaborator, Charles Morice. See his review in Mercure de France 9 (Sept.\u2013Dec. 1893), p. 296:\n\nNave nave fenua. C\u2019est la m\u00eame terre, la Terre d\u00e9licieuse. C\u2019est l\u2019Eden tahitien. Mais ici l\u2019oeil du peintre, tout fid\u00e8le qu\u2019il reste \u00e0 la sensation, ob\u00e9it a une po\u00e9tique pens\u00e9e, et le tableau se compose. Une femme nue, puissante et tr\u00e8s douce, atteint d\u2019un geste timide des fleurs telles que les yeux \u00e9blouissants des plumes des paons, des fleurs d\u2019orgueil. Elle va les cueillir et un monstre ail\u00e9, noir aux ailes rouges, siffle \u00e0 ses oreilles le mauvais conseil. (Nave nave fenua. It\u2019s the same earth, the delicious Earth. It is the Tahitian Eden. But here the eye of the painter, faithful as he is to his sensations, yields to a poetic thought, and the painting takes shape. A nude woman, strong and very sweet, reaches with a timid gesture to flowers that are like the shining eyes of the peacocks\u2019 feathers, flowers of pride. She will gather them, and a winged monster, black with red wings, whispers bad advice into her ears.)\n\nFor more on the identification of the peacock plant in the lost painting Noa Noa, see Scented Sites, note 5.\n\nFor a discussion of Nave nave fenua\u2013themed works, see Charles F.

(Galeries Durand-Ruel, 1893), p. 18, cat. 16. Navenave (delicious, charming, ravishing, etc.) is a duplication of nave (to be delighted, etc.); fenua means \u201cland,\u201d \u201ccountry,\u201d and was used to translate \u201cthe earth\u201d in the Bible, as in \u201cThy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven\u201d (Matthew 6:10). Bengt Danielsson and Hiriata Millaud disagreed about the correctness of the syntactical construction. Danielsson proposed the translation \u201cLand of sensuous pleasure\u201d and found that \u201cDelightful land\u201d is \u201cprudish but acceptable\u201d; Danielsson, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Tahitian Titles,\u201d Burlington Magazine 109, no. 769 (Apr. 1967), p. 231, no. 36. Millaud regarded the duplication navenave (with a nuance between the spellings nave nave and navenave) as expressing an \u201cextreme pleasure,\u201d and she associated fenua with the placenta, the umbilical cord, and women, as well as with the land; Millaud, \u201cLes titres tahitiens de Gauguin,\u201d in Ia orana Gauguin, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e de Tahiti et des \u00celes/Somogy, 2003), p. 86.\n\nThis print can be called Navenave fenua, as this is how Gauguin wrote it into his boxwood matrix, and it is a perfectly correct Tahitian expression. However, the Art Institute of Chicago is retaining the title Nave nave fenua because that is how this print is known in all the literature on it to date. Calvin Brown suggested understanding the Noa Noa Suite as organized around the three vertical prints; Alastair Wright and Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010), p. 110. However, these prints may also possess a structural function within a different sequence, such as the one proposed by Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d).\n\nStephen Eisenman, who has paid the closest attention to this ornamental band, described it as \u201ca vertical column of Polynesian-inspired ornament, starting with a domino pattern at the top, a pair of diamonds below that, followed by another domino pattern, a ragged saw-tooth, a double-headed serpent embracing a crescent, some interlocking chevrons, another crescent and finally the PGO monogram\u201d; Eisenman, Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream, exh. cat. (Skira, 2007), p. 298, cat. 78. Unusually, Alistair Wright proposed another possible source in tapa (bark-cloth) designs; Wright, \u201cParadise Lost: Gauguin and the Melancholy Logic of Reproduction,\u201d in Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010), p. 68.\n\nThis motif can naturally be \u201cread\u201d from top to bottom as well. The expression \u201ctikigenic\u201d comes from the German ethnographer Karl von den Steinen, whose magnum opus, Die marquesaner und ihre Kunst (1925\u201328), provided what remains the most systematic, detailed, and perceptive analysis of Marquesan \u201cornament\u201d; his morphogenetic study distinguishes between motifs deriving respectively from weaving (\u201cplectogenic\u201d) and from the tiki figure (\u201ctikigenic\u201d). For \u201cplectogenic\u201d patterns comparable to the chevron, diamond, and checkerboard motifs of Gauguin\u2019s decorative band, see the French edition, Von den Steinen, Les marquisiens et leur art (Mus\u00e9e de Tahiti et des \u00celes, 2005), for example, vol. 1, pp. 133, 138, 140.\n\nPaul Gauguin, Avant et apr\u00e8s (1903) (Avant et Apr\u00e8s, 1989), p. 73; English: Paul Gauguin\u2019s Intimate Journals, trans.

Gosselin, 1836]), also reissued.\n\nSee, for example, John Milton, Paradise Lost, book 4, lines 20\u201324 and 73\u201377, and book 9, lines 455\u201379.\n\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost, book 4, lines 742\u201345.\n\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost, book 5, line 388.\n\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost, book 9, lines 424\u201331.\n\nStephen F.
