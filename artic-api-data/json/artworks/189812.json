Knotted Chair, designed for the Dutch group Droog Design, in collaboration with the faculty of aviation at Delft Technical University, was the first project by Wanders to attract international interest. Constructed to resemble hand-knotted macram\u00e9, the chair is actually made from aramid fibers twisted around a carbon core and filled with epoxy resin, resulting in an incredibly strong and durable object.</p>\n",
