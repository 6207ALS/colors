    "description": "<p>Focusing on time-based media art conservation as an ongoing process, this two-day symposium and workshop invites artists, curators, conservators, technicians, scholars, collection managers, and registrars to explore how technical and aesthetic decisions impact the preservation of artworks.</p><p>From the selection of formats during production, to the continual reformatting of moving image works, to \u201creconstructions\u201d of works that are partly lost or obsolete, choices of assessment and care are interwoven with how artworks are seen and remembered. Artists can be critical stakeholders in conservation approaches, including repositioning their past works into new contexts or modes of display. Further, the transfer between formats as technological platforms change provides opportunities to revisit an artwork\u2019s identity or assess the underlying attributes of an analog or digital format. <em>UNFOLDING</em> will draw from art history, conservation, artists\u2019 own procedures, and technical fields of expertise with the aim of expanding our collective attention to the in-between moments in the lives of artworks.</p><p>This event is sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and hosted through the Time-Based Media Initiative at the Art Institute. It is co-organized jointly by the museum\u2019s departments of Academic Engagement and Research, Conservation and Science, Modern and Contemporary Art, Photography, and Architecture and Design.</p><p>This event is free but registration is required.</p><p><em>UNFOLDING</em> also occurs on <a href=\"/events/4705/scholars-day-unfoldingproduction-and-process-in-time-based-media-art\" target=\"_blank\">October 31, 2:00\u20136:00</a>.</p><h3><strong><br>Schedule | Panel Discussions&nbsp;and Time-Based Media Art Workshop</strong></h3><p><strong>9:30 a.m. | Coffee<br></strong></p><p><strong>10:00 a.m. | Welcome and Introductions</strong><br><br><strong>10:15 a.m. | Panel III: Commissioning Art and Performance\u2014An Alternative Practice of Stewardship</strong><br>Johanna Burton, Wexner Center for the Arts, Ohio<br>Larry Smallwood, Clark Art Institute, Massachusetts&nbsp;<br>Trajal Harrell, Artist&nbsp;<br>Chairs: Hendrik Folkerts and Jordan Carter, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>11:30 a.m. | Panel IV: Born-Digital Art</strong><br>Mark Hellar, Hellar Studios, LLC, San Francisco&nbsp;<br>Jan Tichy, Artist<br>Andreas Angelidakis, Artist and Architect<br>Chair: Maite Borjabad, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>12:30 p.m. | Lunch</strong></p><p><strong>1:45 p.m. | Introductions to Time-Based Media Art Workshop and Attendees</strong></p><p><strong>2:00 p.m. | Presentation by Small Data Industries</strong></p><p><strong>2:30 p.m. | Workshop: Assessing Digital Files&nbsp;<br></strong>Led by Jeff Martin, Consulting Media Conservator, Kramlich Collection/New Art Trust and Kristin MacDonough, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>4:00 p.m. | Moderated Q&amp;A on Digital Preservation</strong></p><p><strong>4:30 p.m. | Group Discussion on the Midwest Media Arts Consortium and Closing Remarks</strong></p><p><strong>5:00 p.m. | Reception</strong></p>",
