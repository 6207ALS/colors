Robinson, 1949.1132\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent brown glass. Blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rim is rounded by reheating, flared out, then infolded. The wall bends in to a constricted neck and tapers outward in a convex line to form a long ovoid body. The base is applied and tooled; the underside is thickened and has a pontil mark. A thick coil is applied at the lower quarter of the body. The coil is laid onto the surface, then pulled out and up to join the top of the rim, then folded, tooled, and flattened to form a thumb rest. The trail below the handle is crimped into nine horizontal fins or tabs to form a decorative ridge along the back of the vessel. For a zoomable image, see fig. 118.1.\n\nThe jug is intact; there is some iridescent film on the handle and rim as well as patches on the base.\n\nThis is a rather unusual form blown in a color that is not particularly common in Roman glass; see the related vessel, a beaker or cup of the same color (cat. 125). It is an unintentional color found in glass, with iron impurity usually associated with the silica in the form of sand used for production.\n\nAlthough the form is uncommon, there is a small storage jar in a private collection in the Netherlands without handles that is a parallel in profile, sharing an out-turned rim and swelling body. The elaborate tooled handle decoration can be found on unrelated vessels. The characteristic pinched decoration is a hallmark of pitchers in the northwestern provinces. A fine example is in the Corning Museum of Glass. The decoration is found on other forms, such as the famous snake-thread decorated masterpiece in the R\u00f6misch-Germanischen Museum, Cologne. On other forms, probably from the eastern Roman Empire, there are fish with elaborate fins and bottles with tooled decoration on their sides.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The Chicago jug was published in Luckner, \u201cAncient Glass,\u201d p. 87, no. 65 (illus.).\n\nBijnsdorp, Fascinating Fragility, p. 202, no.
