    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The political and romantic alliance of Egyptian queen Cleopatra and Roman Commander Marc Antony is legendary. During their ill-fated war against Rome they minted coins to pay their armies and settle debts.  This silver coin is remarkable not only because of the degree of detail but because it features the likenesses of both figures. And perhaps most interesting is the fact that Cleopatra appears on the front while Marc Antony receives second billing on the back. Katherine Raff Rice Foundation Curatorial Fellow in the Art Institute\u2019s department of ancient and Byzantine Art.</p>\n<p>KATHERINE RAFF: Cleopatra is displayed on the obverse, the more important side. She was married to Marc Antony later in her life and they had children together. But she\u2019s really staking a claim here saying that she is the more important of the two.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The two profiles are nearly identical sharing the masculine features including the flat nose, strong chin and thick neck complete with large Adam\u2019s apple. Across a political landscape ruled by men this served a dual purpose. Cleopatra was broadcasting her power as queen of Egypt while also emphasizing her partnership with Marc Antony.<br>Katherine Raff:  You can see with her hair and necklace that she clearly is a woman but that seems to be less of a consideration than making a very bold point about her importance as a ruler.</p>\n",
