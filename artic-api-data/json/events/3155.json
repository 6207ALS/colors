    "description": "<p>Renowned Chicago music group Joan of Arc perform an original live score to Carl Dreyer\u2019s seminal 1928 silent film <em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em>. The group\u2019s alternately dark and lyrical soundtrack offers a sonic counterpart to Dreyer\u2019s haunting depiction of religious persecution.</p><p><em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em> is based on the records of the 1431 trial that led to Joan of Arc being convicted of heresy and burned at the stake. Through the use of close-ups that lay bare every nuance of the characters' reactions, Dreyer focuses on the spiritual and psychological confrontations between Joan and her judges. While the initial reaction to the film\u2019s uncompromising formal vocabulary and raw intensity was one of reserve, the film has come to occupy a place among the most respected masterpieces in film history.</p><p><strong>About the artists</strong></p><p>Chicago's Joan of Arc is never reliant on the status quo. In the course of their history, the band's recorded output has elicited not only critical praise for challenging the norms of traditional songwriting, but also significant backlash from reviewers who became increasingly confused by the band's eclectic output. Formed in 1996 by Tim Kinsella (Cap\u2019n Jazz, Owls), the band has released numerous albums in addition to collaborating with experimental theater ensemble Every House Has a Door on the performance work <em>Testimonium</em>.</p><p>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event.</p>",
