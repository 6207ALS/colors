    "description": "<p>Art Shay is one of Chicago\u2019s great photojournalists. With more than 25,000 published photographs\u2014including more than 1,000 magazine covers\u2014Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.</p>\n<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs\u2014of an American military air disaster\u2014were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay\u2019s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.</p>\n<p>Of particular significance in Shay\u2019s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909\u20131981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city\u2019s down-and-out, and the photographer\u2019s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.</p>\n<p>In his 1951 hymn to the city, <em>Chicago: City on the Make</em>, Nelson Algren compared his affection for his adopted home to loving a woman with a broken nose, writing, \u201cyou may find lovelier lovelies, but never a lovely so real.\u201d Working in Chicago as a photojournalist since 1948, Art Shay befriended Algren while preparing a pitch for a story on the \u201cprose poet of the Chicago slums\u201d for <em>Life</em> magazine. For the next 15 years Shay documented Algren\u2019s life in Chicago, in particular the neighborhood around the intersection of Damen Avenue and Division Street, where Algren lived and found inspiration for his writing. Here Shay captures Algren in front of the Polonia Bar, the opening location of his famous 1947 short story \u201cHow the Devil Came Down Division Street.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cHere Algren has just emerged from losing yet again in a Division Street poker game. In this game his dealer was the legendary dealer/heroin addict Bill Hackett. Algren\u2019s favorite short story of his Chicago oeuvre was \u201cHow The Devil Came down Division Street.\u201d It was a fanciful jaunt of a doomed immigrant alcoholic down a wild street in the Algrenian imagination. \u201cOncoming evenings\u201d (as Algren called them) were always special for him as a writer. In his classic 1951 essay, <em>Chicago: City on the Make,</em> he limned \u201cthe great city\u2019s night colors,\u201d \u201cits ceaseless dramas lived out behind blind doors, and the jargon-tongue of Chicago\u2019s as spoken in our Saturday night dance halls, bookie joints and courts.\u201d\u2019<br>\u2014Art Shay</p>\n",
