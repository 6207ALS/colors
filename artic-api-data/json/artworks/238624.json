An almost obsessive use of vertical ink hatching reminiscent of printmaking (in which Jefferys was trained) is accompanied by broad passages of brown wash to establish location and mood. While the artist occasionally uses light brown wash for modeling, for the most part the flesh of his strongly outlined nude figures is defined by the untouched cream-colored paper.</p>\n",
