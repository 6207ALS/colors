He used a metal-nibbed dip pen and glossy, black ink. The artist wove this spare composition together from a series of shorter lines rather than from a few, continuous lines. Matisse had a solid understanding of how much ink his pen held and how long a line he could achieve with one dip of the pen. For example, he executed the neck, opening, and stopper of the ewer with one looping pen stroke (see fig. 53.1). With great skill and control, he created relatively uniform lines; few tapered off as the ink ran dry or show the variation in width caused by vacillations in pressure. He reserved heavy, black lines for the fruit to mark the central point from which the rest of the composition radiates.\n\nMatisse took the drawing right up to the edges of the sheet; ink extends onto the lower edge and nearly to the left and top edges. The sheet dimensions remain unchanged from the time he executed this work.\n\nSigned and dated: Matisse 44 (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 53.2).\n\nMatisse drew using pen and black ink. When the surface is viewed at an angle the ink appears glossy, indicating the presence of a resinous binder. Under ultraviolet light (365 nm) the binder in the ink exhibits an orange fluorescence (characteristic of shellac) on the center of the verso (fig. 53.3), in the area of the densest ink application.\n\nThe support is medium-thick, smooth, ivory wove paper. The furnish contains occasional colored fibers visible under magnification 2\u00d7. The edges are hand torn. The sheet is semitranslucent. Transmitted-light examination reveals a fine screen pattern.\n\n52.2 \u00d7 40 cm (20 3/8 \u00d7 15 3/4 in.).\n\nWith curatorial approval, in 2010 graphite framer\u2019s marks and other later notations on the verso were erased because they were visible from the recto due to the translucent nature of the paper (see fig. 53.4). These were photodocumented prior to removal (fig. 53.5, fig. 53.6, fig. 53.7, and fig. 53.8).\n\nThere is no other record of conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.\n\nTransmitted light reveals a circle with an X or cross through it. The circle is approximately 2.5 cm in diameter and is located 8.5 cm from the right and 9 cm from the lower edges. This is not a watermark. Microscope examination at 80\u00d7 of the verso with raking light shows that the area has been very gently abraded. It is possible this was done to remove a faint mark or stain. Under ultraviolet light (365 nm) the translucent circle appears light gray, as if there is residue from media present. This abraded area can be seen on a photograph of the verso taken on June 28, 2010.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. The tip of the lower right corner is creased. The sheet is cockled at all edges. There are gray stains at the right edge, 16 and 31.5 cm from the top edge. Under ultraviolet light (254 nm) there is a long, horizontal mark evident on the verso, near the center of the left edge, that appears to be a liquid drip and fluoresces white as if it contains optical brighteners. There is no trace of this \u201cdrip\u201d under normal light. It indicates the sheet came into contact with some extraneous liquid at some point.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Marguerite Duthuit (n\u00e9e, Marguerite Emilienne Matisse, Aug. 31, 1894\u2013Apr. 1, 1982), Paris.\n\nClaude Duthuit (1931\u2013May 2011) and Barbara Duthuit, Paris.\n\nRuth Stanton Family Foundation, New York, by Feb. 21, 2005\u2013June 13 2005.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 13, 2005.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Rome, Musei Capitolini, Matisse: \u201cLa r\u00e9v\u00e9lation m\u2019est venue de l\u2019Orient,\u201d Sept. 20, 1997\u2013Jan. 20, 1998, cat. 176 (ill.), as Giovane donna seduta a un tavolo, 1944.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">R\u00e9mi Labrusse, \u201cCatalogo delle opera: 176,\u201d in Claude Duthuit et al., Matisse: \u201cLa r\u00e9v\u00e9lation m\u2019est venue de l\u2019Orient,\u201d exh. cat.
