Robinson, 1946.1050\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent light-yellow-green glass. Pattern-molded, blown, trail decorated, and tooled. A thickened, rounded rim flares out from a sharply tapering, straight-sided vessel wall attached to a thickened, flattened base. There is a pontil mark on the underside. The body is spirally ribbed; about a quarter of the way down the vessel wall, a single thick horizontal trail defines the start of the spiral decoration below it. For a zoomable image, see fig. 129.1.\n\nThe beaker is intact, with an overall light-brown incrustation and thin, milky weathering product with some patches of iridescence.\n\nThis is an unusual variation on a form that appears with a variety of base types throughout the Roman world, in all periods. The applied trail on a pattern-molded body suggests a later date for the beaker.\n\nThere are two related beakers in the Princeton University Art Museum. One is comparable to this vessel but with more characteristic sets of wheel-cut decoration on the body; the other one is plain and has a similar profile. There is a similar form in the Middle Eastern Culture Center, Tokyo, with the same tooled foot but without applied decoration. A beaker said to have been in a Jerusalem private collection, on the American market, and another, formerly in the Erwin Oppenl\u00e4nder collection in Waiblingen, near Stuttgart, are two more variations, the Oppenl\u00e4nder beaker being more flared and said to be from the Black Sea region and found at Olbia.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 48, form 34.\n\nSee Antonaras, Fire and Sand, pp. 129\u201330, nos. 173 and 174, which is compared to Isings form 109c, a later vessel type that is found in Frankish tomb groups; Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, pp. 136\u201337.\n\nIdemitsu Museum of Arts, Treasures of the Orient, pp. 138, 260, no. 169.\n\nFortuna Fine Arts, Solid Liquid, p. 69, no. 120, is probably later than its first-century-A.D. attribution.\n\nSaldern et al., Gl\u00e4ser der Antike, pp. 258\u201359, no. 757, color illus.; p. 245, a beaker on a solid pad base and no decoration, 4th/5th century A.D.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 129 Beaker, 3rd/4th century A.D.\n\nfig. 129.1 Beaker (3rd/4th century A.D.).
