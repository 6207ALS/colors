    "transcript": "<p>KATE NESIN: This is one of my favorite paintings we have. Joan Mitchell\u2019s \u201cCity Landscape\u201d from 1955.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Curator Kate Nesin.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: It\u2019s a work that has been described primarily according to this tangle of pigments that stretched horizontally across the center of the canvas. It\u2019s a dripping painting, a slashing painting. The strokes are visible as if laid down really vigorously in haste.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  But, in fact, Mitchell worked quite methodically.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN:  She would say that she would paint a little and then sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. And she described eventually the painting told her what to do. So she really built the surface up mark by mark stroke by stroke over time despite the tangle and speed and density implied by the title of \u201cCity Landscape.\u201d</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Though keenly aware of its abstract elements curator Nesin initially read the image as a distant skyline with a cloudy sky above and gray reflective water below.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN:  But there are all sorts of different viewpoints we could step into. There is the sense in which this could be an aerial view, a kind of dense island city surrounded by water. This could be a nighttime or a twilit evening view of a city street on a rainy day. So that tangle of pigments are lights of various kinds that are lost in this dripping mass of sky and gray concrete building. This is a painting that collapses a number of possible representational views into a single densely worked abstract surface.</p>\n",
