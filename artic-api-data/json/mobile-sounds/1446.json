    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: An incident in the life of the historical Buddha inspired this thirteenth century sandstone sculpture. A serpent king or Mucalinda once spread his multiple hoods over Buddha as a canopy to protect him from a storm. Here Buddha sits in the lotus posture of meditation on a seat formed by three coils of the serpent\u2019s body. The Mucalinda\u2019s seven hoods form a nimbus around Buddha\u2019s head.  Buddha wears a crown. This identifies the figure as the transcendental Buddha Akshobhya rather than the historical Buddha Shakyamuni. Many images like this one were produced in today\u2019s Thailand and Cambodia during the time of the Khmer Empire. The subject of Buddha sheltered by a Mucalinda became especially popular after it was endorsed by the Khmer King Jayavarman VII. In this sculpture each horizontal coil or register under the Buddha is wider than the one below. This arrangement resembles the ultra like seats of the earliest Indian Buddha\u2019s. These three coils may allude to three worlds of early Buddhist and Hindu cosmology, the worlds of desire, of form and of formlessness.</p>\n",
