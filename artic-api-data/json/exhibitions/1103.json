    "short_description": "American fashion photographer Irving Penn, who died in October, at the age of 92, used his craft and his subjects as vehicles for a civilizing enterprise. Against the bestiality and depredations of global warfare\u2014Penn\u2019s legendary tenure at Vogue began in 1943, in the depths of World War II\u2014the photographer strove for humanity and calm; while the postwar world hummed with speed and increasingly youthful, violent energies, his ageless compositions served as models of balance, restraint, and order. Not that Penn turned his back on the world, or sanitized its inequities.",
