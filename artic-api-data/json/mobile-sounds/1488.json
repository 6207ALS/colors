    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Curator Judy Barter.</p>\n<p>JUDY BARTER: This is such an interesting object because the clock was made early around 1820 and yet the decoration is from the 1880s. So this is someone updating and old piece of furniture to make it appear contemporary. At the time, one of the things that was so popular in the 1880s was Japanism.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: This meant Japanese influenced art and imagery. A fascination with Japanese art had swept America and Europe since Japan was reopened to western trade in the 1850s following over 200 years of virtual isolation.<br>Judy Barter:  And if you look at the sides of the clock, particularly you will see Japanist [ph?] designs, in other words, asymmetrical vignettes, flattened quality of design, elaborate scenes and gold painted cartouches. These are all taken right out of books of Japanist design. On the front, however, is the history of a section of Maine, which at the time of the founding of the United States was still a part of the state of Massachusetts. So there\u2019s a Revolutionary War battle at Lexington, Massachusetts, for example, that\u2019s depicted here.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  This is in the roundel in the center of the clock\u2019s door. The largest scene painted on the base of the clock shows a conflict between Native Americans and settlers.</p>\n",
