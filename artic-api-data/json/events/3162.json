Whether facilitating a state of deep focus or engaging in playful and speedy drawing exercises, this class will investigate the relationship between time and drawing. Participants will work on a multiple-session long-term drawing and experiment with fast-drawing techniques. The class will also explore approaches to depicting the abstract and literal notions of time and speed. Materials are provided.</p><p>For additional information about upcoming Member Sketch Classes, please call (312) 499-4111 or visit the <a href=\"/join-and-give/members/member-programs/member-art-classes-2015\">member art class</a> page.</p>",
