    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This monumental painting, entitled simply, &quot;Red Yellow Blue White and Black&quot;, is by Ellsworth Kelly.  He made it in 1953 while living in Paris.  Curator James Rondeau:</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU:  This picture was realized at a crucial moment near the end of Kelly's sojourn in Paris just as he was beginning to really uncover what proves to be the near infinite possibilities of the monochrome, the color spectrum, chance ordering, and multi-panel composition.  What Kelly I think wants us to see here are the most pared-down basics of color and form and the relationship to one another, how color is defined by shape, how shape defines color, how we read colors in relationship one to the other, how blue reads differently next to red than it reads next to white, how the center black panel in a way holds this seven-panel composition together, but also the relationship between the individual panels and the wall that surrounds them.  In a traditional landscape painting you might have a tree in the near space and a mountain in the far space.  Those notions of foreground and background that we think about in compositional terms, if we take that basic structure when examining these works, the foreground of this experience are the panels themselves, and the background is the wall, or the architectural space which surrounds them.</p>\n",
