    "description": "<p>In the summer of 1965, having graduated two years earlier from the University of Chicago, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/15789/danny-lyon\">Danny Lyon</a> traveled on his Triumph motorcycle from his home in Hyde Park to Chicago\u2019s tough Uptown neighborhood. The area had acquired the nickname Hillbilly Heaven for its large number of immigrants from central Appalachia. Over a period of several months, Lyon photographed residents of Uptown\u2019s Clifton Avenue using a Rolleiflex camera borrowed from his close friend and mentor Hugh Edwards, then a photography curator at the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>Lyon gained the trust of several families, resulting in images that depict struggles but also immense community pride: \u201cparadise inside a square,\u201d as the photographer said, referencing the camera\u2019s square format. In 1966 Lyon wrote of the project, \u201cThe pictures are not made to disturb people\u2019s consciences but rather to disturb their consciousness. The pictures do not ask you to \u2018help\u2019 these people, but something much more difficult; to be briefly and intensely aware of their existence, an existence as real and significant as your own.\u201d</p>\n",
