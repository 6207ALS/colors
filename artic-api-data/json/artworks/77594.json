At the time, some Americans expressed concern that the importation of luxury goods, such as silk, from Europe, did not properly showcase the nation\u2019s greatness. Under the direction of Gertrude Rapp, members of the Harmony Society, a small pious sect of Lutheran immigrants, raised silkworms and wove silk textiles. Although members supposedly had no interest in fashion or luxury, this colorful silk velvet demonstrates their dedication to self-sufficiency.</p>\n",
