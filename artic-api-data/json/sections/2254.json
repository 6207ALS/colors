A two-part plaster mold would have been made from the model, often by a professional mold maker. The model would almost certainly have been damaged or destroyed when the mold was removed. From this waste mold a plaster of the sculpture was then cast, which, in turn, was then used to make a carefully created piece mold or a flexible gelatin mold. From one of the plaster versions yet another mold would have been made, in this case, a gelatin mold for lost-wax casting. The bronze edition of Thorn Extractor was lost-wax cast by the C. Valsuani foundry. Numerous mold lines are visible on the surface. It has a dark-brown patina, lightening to a medium-golden-brown tone. X-ray images show evidence of the casting and of repairs.\n\nIncised: 6/10 HM (on back) (fig. 10.1).\n\nBronze (an alloy of primarily copper and tin). A sample was taken for [glossary:LA-ICP MS] analysis (fig. 10.2).\n\nLost-wax cast.\n\nC. Valsuani foundry, Paris.\n\nDark brown, lightening to a medium-golden-brown tone on larger flat areas. XRF analysis of the surface indicates that the patina contains chromium, a characteristic of many Valsuani patinas.\n\nThe core material is white with a granular component (fig. 10.3). There are numerous mold lines, the most prominent of which are at the proper left side of the supporting element, the proper left back corner, the back of the hips extending into the supporting element, and across the proper right leg, extending into the supporting element (fig. 10.4).\n\nX-rays of the object (fig. 10.5) show a few round plugs, repairs of casting flaws done, likely while still at the Valsuani foundry. There also appears to be a repair in the back of the supporting element in which an irregular piece of bronze has been incorporated into a gap. This repair corresponds to a slight depression in the outside surface.\n\nThe piece was lightly cleaned of grime in 2013 by Art Institute conservators. A small amount of microcrystalline wax was added to dull areas.\n\nThe sculpture is in sound condition. Grayish-white material, possibly investment, is visible in low areas of the face and neck and, to a lesser extent, elsewhere on the sculpture. There are a few very tiny bright scratches.  \nSuzanne R.
