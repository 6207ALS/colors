After campaigns in Pont-Aven, Martinique, and Arles, Gauguin sought an even more distant locale: a more \u201cprimitive\u201d environment that he thought would be far from the financial pressures and corrupting nature of Western civilization. In his estimation this distance would allow him to further his work, which he thought at the time was \u201conly a seedling . . . out there I hope to cultivate it for my own pleasure in its primitive and savage state. In order to do that I must have peace and quiet.\u201d When Gauguin arrived at the port of Papeete (fig. 27.1) on the ninth of June, he was not only seeking his \u201cstudio of the tropics,\u201d but was also arriving with a mandate from the Ministry of Fine Arts to study and paint the local landscapes and Tahitian customs.\n\nGauguin painted this landscape with lush vegetation, dwellings, and locals going about their daily lives in the fall of 1891 while living in a native house in the small village of Mataiea some forty miles south of Papeete, which also served as Tahiti\u2019s capital (fig. 27.2). Among the very first canvases he undertook after his arrival, it is the direct outcome of months of preparation of the kind he expressly preferred when encountering a new environment. \u201cIn each locale,\u201d he would later write, \u201cI need a certain period of incubation, so that I may learn every time the essence of the plants and trees.\u201d As before, drawing was the critical instrument for \u201cgetting the engine started in a new country . . . [of getting] used to the personality of each thing and each individual.\u201d He made studies of local vegetation, animals, and the population at rest and at work (see, for example, fig. 27.3 and cats. 29\u201338).\n\nWhat distinguished the Tahitian project from Gauguin\u2019s earlier encounters with cultures new to him was the self-consciousness of the official artistic mission that had brought him to the South Pacific. In March 1891 he had requested and received from the Minister of Public Education and Fine Arts a government-sponsored assignment: a \u201cmission to Tahiti, in order to study from an artistic viewpoint, and for the paintings that might result, the customs and landscapes of that country.\u201d\n\nGauguin took the assignment seriously, as is evident in his report, shortly after his arrival, to a close friend: \u201cStill not one painting, but a lot of research which can bear fruit, many documents that I hope will be useful for a long time in France.\u201d Several months later, he informed another, \u201cI am working harder and harder, but so far only on studies or, rather, documents, which are building up. If they are not useful to me later, they\u2019ll be so to others.\u201d This repeated characterization of his Tahitian drawings as precious research documents, as a kind of visual field work that constitutes the necessary preliminary to the later, off-site task of creating the synthetic statement that is the painting, reveals the same scientific bias reflected in his application for government sponsorships. His stated goal\u2014to create a series of pictures in which he \u201cfixes the country\u2019s character and its light\u201d\u2014echoes the language of the \u201cscientific missions,\u201d the exploratory fact-finding expeditions then touted as the intellectual by-products of colonialist expansion. As a sailor, Gauguin had indirectly been part of such ventures; now, as an artist, he was on comparable ethnographic mission of his own.\n\nWhat distinguishes Te raau rahi from Gauguin\u2019s other Tahitian pictures of 1891 is the wealth of descriptive detail it includes about the local vegetation. Reading the picture from left to right (fig. 27.4) we can identify a number of trees that have medicinal uses or bear fruits that are staples of the Tahitian diet: a poison fish tree (hotu), a mango tree, a coconut palm (harri), a tropical almond (auteraa), and a banana tree (tunu maia). A breadfruit tree (uru), though not seen in the picture, stands nearby, as attested by the discolored orange leaves that lie scattered in the foreground to the left of the seated figure. Absorbed into the landscape, as if a part of nature, are, in the middle zone, the native huts with roofs made with plaited pandanus or coconut leaves. Their occupants, who populate the foreground, go about their daily routine. The bending man at left is absorbed in the task of husking a coconut on the banks of a small stream that extends from the far left of the composition diagonally up the hibiscus hedge (fig. 27.5). On the right a woman cares for a child, and another woman stands with her back to us (fig. 27.6).\n\nThe clear result of months of observation, Te raau rahi richly satisfies Gauguin\u2019s avowed mission while at the same time realizing the pictorial potential of his surroundings. This is most clearly signaled by the hibiscus shrub at the far right of the composition. It is identifiable despite the artist\u2019s clear interest in the decorative potential of its color and the linear rhythms of the branches that are echoed by the tree branches that fill the sky in the top third of the picture plane. Richard Field was right to identify this canvas as \u201cunique\u201d by virtue of its color, variety of shapes, and activated design.\n\nScholars have debated whether the Chicago picture was the Te raau rahi that was one of eight Tahitian paintings by Gauguin exhibited in Den Frie Udstilling (The Free Exhibition), an 1893 show organized by his wife, Mette, in Copenhagen. This stems from the fact that it bears the same inscribed Tahitian title as another of Gauguin\u2019s pictures of 1891, now in the collection of the Cleveland Museum of Art (fig. 27.7 [W 437]). While we cannot know for sure which painting was exhibited in Copenhagen as Te raau rahi, the evidence favors the Chicago picture. To begin with, we know that, in anticipation of the exhibition, Gauguin wrote to his friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid asking him to add titles in Tahitian to the surfaces of four of the eight pictures that he was shipping to him in Paris: he requested that one, which he described as \u201cLe paysage grand arbre\u201d (\u201cLandscape large tree\u201d), bear the title \u201cTe raau rahi.\u201d The question remains as to which canvas Monfreid applied this inscription. When the inscribed titles on the Chicago and Cleveland paintings are compared, it is clear that the handwriting is not the same (fig. 27.8). Richard Field has suggested that the inscription on the Cleveland picture is not in Gauguin\u2019s hand but rather was applied by Monfreid. Based on this identification, and his comparison of the Cleveland inscription to the other three on Gauguin\u2019s list, Field believes that it was in fact the Cleveland picture that was included in the exhibition. Daniel Wildenstein has suggested that the inscription found on the Chicago picture is also not in Gauguin\u2019s hand. This is a curious assertion, for if one compares the inscription to Gauguin\u2019s handwritten manuscript Noa Noa, there is a distinct similarity between the two (fig. 27.9). Technical examination of the inscribed title on the Chicago painting has revealed that the inscription in this case was first written in pencil (fig. 27.10), was traced over in paint, and was later scraped down and traced over again in paint (Technical Study). In addition, it is possible that the painting was waxed before the painted inscriptions were added, which may have necessitated the reapplication of the inscription (the wax layer may have caused the initial inscription to flake) but may also suggest that Monfreid played a part in its addition (Technical Study). In the same December 1891 letter to Monfreid, Gauguin instructed him, upon receiving the group, to \u201cwash them [the paintings] carefully and with many precautions . . . you will wax [them].\u201d This sequence of events allows for the possibility that Gauguin first wrote the inscription on the canvas, thus explaining the similarity in handwriting to Noa Noa, and that Monfreid later traced over the pencil lines with paint.\n\nExamining the inscriptions alone may not lead to a definitive answer as to which Te raau rahi was shown in the 1893 Copenhagen exhibition. Another piece to this puzzle is that a very close variant of the Cleveland composition was certainly on display in Copenhagen. Gauguin included this work in the shipment to Monfreid and asked him to title it Te fare maori, describing it in his letter as \u201cLa maison avec le cheval\u201d (\u201cThe house with the horse\u201d) (fig. 27.11 [W 436]). It is highly unlikely that were he planning to show Te fare maori in Copenhagen that Gauguin, with his exhibition sense, would also have included its close variant. The impact of each would have been diminished by their similarity, making the artist look repetitive.\n\nFinally, landscape is more expressly the subject of the Art Institute\u2019s picture, the abundance of nature more explicit and the human presence and habitations more fully absorbed into its design. While both the Cleveland painting and Te fare maori feature a house prominently in a landscape, the Chicago picture subordinates dwellings, figures, and animals to the landscape in which they find themselves. This focus of the Chicago composition is arguably more in keeping with Gauguin\u2019s description in his letter of a landscape wherein a big tree was the principal subject.\n\nIn Gauguin\u2019s semiautobiographical account of his time in Tahiti, he offered this somewhat Panglossian description of Tahiti and its people:\n\nIt is a perpetual celebration and an absolute disregard for work, because nature\u2019s bounty renders it vain, while the languor of siestas quickly washes away their worries.\u2014This is Tahiti! An island explored by travelers but misunderstood, bringing back nothing but fables, but here she is at last, depicted by a painter who fell in love with her\u2014Here is Tahiti and its people, the most beautiful in the world with her stunning flora.\n\nGauguin\u2019s official mission tasked him to capture this Tahiti, and Te raau rahi was an early attempt to fulfill this mandate by depicting his new home in the forest. It seems here as though Gauguin wished to capture everything all at once: the colors, the vegetation, the people and their way of life.  \nRichard R. Brettell and Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin\u2019s Te raau rahi (The Big Tree) was painted on a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-format (73 \u00d7 92 cm) canvas of coarse twin-threaded basket-weave jute. He primed it with a double layer of a moderately thick chalk-and-glue ground applied by palette knife, which he brushed out to roughen up the jute fibers and enhance the texture. On top of this he drew outlines in what appears to be graphite for the main compositional elements. He then used a brush to apply an additional, more textured white lead layer in the sky. He skirted around the thicker branches as drawn but sketched and painted the thinner branches on top of this added white. Gauguin then underpainted the compositional areas with thin paint layers. He held in reserve the hotu tree (the \u201cbig tree\u201d of the title) at left and most of the figure of the seated woman. He then reinforced the contours with dark-blue lines and continued to add them, reaffirming edges, as the painting progressed. He employed a variety of devices to enhance the hotu\u2019s presence, including strong outlines, contrasting colors, exaggerated aerial perspective behind the tree, and sharply detailed tendrils hanging in front of it.\n\nGauguin\u2019s first area of concentration was the top portion of the landscape, then the figures, and last the foreground. He worked the upper branches against the textured sky more freely and quickly, and the foreground meadow more slowly, with hatched strokes of shifting color. He varied his technique to paint different areas. The big tree was built up with many colors applied in thick smooth layers, resembling the bark of the hotu tree, while the banks of the river at the left edge were simply left underpainted. The hibiscus bush at the right edge has a very linear structure of blue branches that was enhanced with added lines to become abstractly decorative. The artist used small brushes, mostly 2 mm and sometimes 4 mm in width and generally short strokes, although where branches became long and thin, he would paint two or three long, sinuous strokes to define their shape, sometimes twisting the brush onto its narrow edge. Gauguin added texture to the sky and branches in the final paint layers by pouncing and pushing the paint into small ridges and peaks. Elsewhere the paint layers are generally thinned and fluid, and variations in color result from the translucent layering. There is evidence of dry brushing that softened and spread the paint, and of wiping away to thin layers of color still more.\n\nGauguin primarily made minor adjustments to the edges of forms, but he made a more significant change as well. In the final picture, at the foot of the big tree there is a pool of water, but earlier it extended beyond its present right edge as a stream running alongside the base of the hedge. It is still visible above the baby\u2019s head and in front of the standing dog. The reclining dog was larger when first painted, especially its forehead and ears. The seated woman\u2019s sleeve was initially fuller, and the baby wrapped its little arm around hers. The area of the straw hat had been covered by the green lay-in for the bushes. To brighten the yellow, Gauguin painted over the green with a white layer before adding the hat. Similarly, he underpainted the baby with white, which allowed him to paint the gown with softer blue folds, an effect that would have been more difficult if he had painted directly over the green. The inscription was first laid out with pencil and painted over twice, suggesting, as does a letter by Gauguin, that it was possibly not in the artist\u2019s hand. The surface of the picture still retains its original beeswax coating.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 27.12).\n\nSigned and dated: P Gauguin 91 (lower right corner, in dilute dark-blue paint) (fig. 27.13 and fig. 27.14), likely applied with 1 mm rounded-tip brush. Gauguin may have prepared the spot for his own signature by adding extra layers of yellow and green to smooth out the rough jute texture.\n\nInscribed: Te raa\u00f9 rahi (lower left corner, in red earth paint) (fig. 27.15 and fig. 27.16). The inscription was first written in what appears to be graphite on the paint surface, as is visible in the infrared reflectogram (1.5.\u20131.7 \u03bcm). Gauguin had prepared a place for the inscription by painting out some green grass stems, still visible in the infrared reflectogram (1.0\u20131.1 \u03bcm) (fig. 27.17).\n\nThe graphite letters were followed closely when it was rewritten with red earth paint. At some point after the inscription had dried, most of these letters flaked off or were scraped off, leaving behind only small remnants. The inscription was then repainted, again following the graphite letters and covering the remnants of the first inscription. A more full-bodied, less-dilute red earth paint, lightened slightly with zinc white, was employed for this second painted inscription, likely using a 2 mm flat-end brush (fig. 27.18).\n\nJute canvas.\n\nThe original size of the canvas was approximately 73 \u00d7 92 cm, judging from the painted area that is now folded slightly over the edges with 0.5 cm over the left edge and slightly less over the top, while the bottom and right edges align with the stretcher as they had originally. The original size corresponds to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-format canvas, turned horizontally.\n\nTwin-threaded basket-weave (fig. 27.19). The average thread count (standard deviation): 3.7V (0.1) \u00d7 3.7H (0.1) threads/cm (counting double threads as one); the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe basket-weave canvas is fairly tight and relatively strong, although the jute fibers themselves are prone to severe deterioration. A selvage is not apparent.\n\nCurrent stretching: The current stretching dates at least as far back as the lining (which took place sometime before the painting entered the Art Institute collection in 1949), although the earlier stretcher may have been reused after the lining. The tacking margins are partially intact but covered by paper tape. They presently seem to extend from 1.0 to 2.0 cm in width, that is, somewhat narrower than the stretcher depth. They were probably originally wider but broke off over the years before the canvas was lined.\n\nOriginal stretching: The cusping shows relatively even tension around all edges and indicates that the original tacks were initially placed 6\u201312 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The stretcher has five members. The stretcher stock is 6.5 cm wide and 2 cm deep. The corner joints are lapped on the reverse with keys. The stretcher size (72.1 \u00d7 90.8 cm) was increased by nailing a strip of wood 3 mm wide along the bottom and a piece 7 mm wide along the right edge to produce the current measurements (72.5 \u00d7 91.5 cm), although these dimensions were still smaller than the original painted surface, approximately 0.5 cm of which is now folded over on the left and top edges. The current stretcher may date from the restretching after the canvas arrived in France (fig. 27.20).\n\nOriginal stretcher: Unknown. There is a network of cracks in the paint, though not limited to the strongly vertical ones indicative of rolling. The canvas was most likely rolled for shipment from Tahiti.\n\nNone.\n\nNot determined.\n\nGauguin primed the face of the canvas himself after stretching it. Most of the ground samples indicate two separate applications of similar chalk grounds. The combined depth of the grounds is fairly thick and varies from 53\u2013132 \u03bcm to as much as 319 \u03bcm (fig. 27.21). Though identical in composition, the bottom layer generally contains coarser particles, while the top has a finer, more compact arrangement of particles (fig. 27.22). Long grooves and arching scratches in the surface were made by a palette knife as the top ground was applied; this is especially evident near the standing woman (fig. 27.23 and fig. 27.24). The jute fibers are visible through the ground under stereomicroscopic examination. In many areas the fibers in the top ground have been roughened up so that they protrude and are picked up by the paint (fig. 27.25). This suggests that Gauguin used a brush to work the top ground to create a rougher texture after applying it with the palette knife. In other areas it appears that paint chips of ground were dislodged and deposited elsewhere, adding to the surface texture (fig. 27.26). The ground does not quite extend all the way to the original edges. Rather, at the bottom and right sides, which are still visible, the paint often extends beyond the edge of the ground onto unprimed canvas.\n\nThe ground has a slight pinkish cast when observed with the naked eye, and small amounts of colored pigments are detected in the ground. The dark jute fibers, where visible through the ground layers, also contribute to the warm tone of the ground.\n\nBoth layers of ground were found to contain calcium carbonate in the form of chalk with many microfossils and traces of silicate materials (impurities that are associated with chalk), as well as traces of iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, and an unidentified black. The medium of the ground is estimated to be glue.\n\nThere are a number of thin, faint, probably graphite lines visible in the infrared reflectogram (1.5\u20131.7 \u03bcm) that were likely drawn directly on the ground. Gauguin drew in graphite both on the chalk ground and on the subsequent lead white layer in the sky. Major landscape elements, including the tree trunks and main branches, the larger clumps of foliage, the banks of the river, the figures, and the hut, were included in this underdrawing (fig. 27.27).\n\nGauguin then reinforced the graphite contour lines for these elements with a dilute, dark-blue paint similar in quality to that used for his signature. Sometimes these blue lines are visible directly on the ground, such as the top edge of the hut (fig. 27.28). Similar painted sketch lines were later added on top of the first lay-in. Gauguin later painted contour lines to sketch new forms, such as the man\u2019s stick (fig. 27.29). He also reinforced outlines, such as those on much of the big tree, where sections were added at various stages; these emphasize the tree\u2019s massive structure and differentiate it from the background (fig. 27.30). Many of these preliminary and later painted-blue outlines are visible in the reflected-infrared (1.5\u20131.7 \u03bcm) and transmitted-infrared images. One such preliminary outline visible in the latter image is the simple dark line for foliage in the top right corner, which is now covered by a more complex grouping (fig. 27.31).\n\nDuring the sketch phase, Gauguin worked up the seated woman\u2019s hair with dark-blue curls before adding the hat; he retained the blue sketched hair at the nape of her neck (fig. 27.32). Seemingly minor elements, such as the orange fallen breadfruit tree (uru) leaves at bottom center, were even part of the initial blue painted sketch and were individually underpainted. Gauguin held the leaves in reserve, painting around them while adding the final foreground; although when he painted them, he did not follow the blue outlines very closely. This was done soon after the foreground was painted, since the colors mixed wet-in-wet, the orange becoming muddier as the brush moved from left to right to produce the row of leaves (fig. 27.33).\n\nDrawn lines appear to be graphite, judging by their thin, even quality. The blue painted sketch lines were not analyzed. In one sample of a later dark-blue contour line on the seated woman\u2019s blouse, the blue was identified as primarily a mixture of ultramarine blue and Prussian blue.\n\nThere are numerous small adjustments between the graphite drawing, the blue sketch, the initial lay-in, and the painting stages. But overall, the composition was well laid out in the sketched state without major compositional changes thereafter.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination detected painted underlayers, rather than unpainted ground, through the top paint layers. The first lay-in was applied in thin, intermittent washes: greens and blue-greens of various shades for foliage, pale pink for the upper sky, and yellow-green and pale pink for the foreground meadow. The standing woman was laid in with transparent brown, along with the bush behind her; blue was used for her skirt. The trunk of the tropical almond tree right of center was first blocked in with red lake and pink. Gauguin used a red lake to underpaint a number of areas, including the baby\u2019s hair, the mother\u2019s pink sleeve, the dog, many branches, the orange breadfruit leaves on the ground, and the roof of the hut, as well as unidentified forms in the middle distance at the right edge. A sketch from Gauguin\u2019s Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook) could have been used as the source for this hut. The words violet and pourpre (shades of red lake as used in the hut\u2019s underlayer) are written on the roof of the drawing (fig. 27.34 and fig. 27.35).\n\nBecause the layers of underpaint were so thin and the underlying sketch remained visible, the artist did not have to paint around forms and figures, which left the underlayer brushstrokes uninterrupted. For example, the dynamic diagonal dark-blue-green strokes used to block in the hedge were painted over sketch lines for the seated woman\u2019s head, as is confirmed in the transmitted-infrared image (fig. 27.36). The underlayers for the hedge and meadow were painted across the sketches for the standing woman\u2019s legs and the dog standing at her side (see fig. 27.36). Similarly, the turquoise lay-in for the water runs over the sketch for the man\u2019s legs and stick, as is visible in the infrared reflectogram (1.5\u20131.7 \u03bcm), where the absence of legs makes the man appear to be kneeling on the bank (fig. 27.37). To ensure a brighter yellow in the seated woman\u2019s hat, Gauguin first painted out the dark bush underlayer with a white intermediate layer. He also underpainted the baby\u2019s gown with white over the meadow\u2019s underlayer. These white layers can be inferred by their lighter appearance (signifying greater density) in the X-ray and are visible under the stereomicroscope (fig. 27.38). The infrared reflectogram (1.5\u20131.7 \u03bcm) indicates that the seated woman\u2019s sleeve was once fuller, hiding more of the infant, whose arm was originally around hers (fig. 27.39). The back of her hat brim was wider and her skirt a lighter blue-gray, which extended farther down at the bottom.\n\nThe care the artist took in executing the hotu tree at left, the \u201cbig tree\u201d of the title, indicates its importance as the subject of the painting (fig. 27.40, fig. 27.41, and fig. 27.42). He first drew it in pencil on the ground and held it in reserve while completing the lay-in for the adjacent background. He then reinforced its contours with blue and, after painting the surrounding bushes, applied the tree\u2019s preliminary washes directly on the ground: purple, blue, pink, and green for the trunk, shifting to yellow where the tree forks and to green farther along the branches. Although there are spots of impasto at the bottom of the trunk and in the lower branches, for the most part the pale blue, pink, brown, and gray on top were applied in thick, smooth layers that fill in the texture of the jute, perhaps to suggest the smooth surface of hotu bark (fig. 27.43). He skirted around the blue hollow in the trunk, then added touches of myriad colors to this area to create a textured contrast with the smooth bark above. As a naturalistic touch, he even included stringy orange hotu flowers along the top edge.\n\nThe only significant change to the composition involved the water, which, in the final version, is a tranquil pool in the far right foreground. The water was completed quite late in the painting\u2019s genesis. After the turquoise lay-in, the water received a dark-blue-green coat. Along the left edge it was left in this unfinished state, but to the right Gauguin added a wet-into-wet reflective surface of brilliant lighter blues and blue-grays, smoothly filling in the canvas texture as he had for the bark of the big tree (fig. 27.44). In the early stages of painting, the stream met a thin sandbar, now mostly hidden, which thinned its width as it continued across the canvas directly in front of the hedge. Bits of blue water can be seen with the stereomicroscope dipping in between the bushes and in the infrared reflectogram (1.5\u20131.7 \u03bcm) flowing along as a thin blue ribbon, widening and narrowing; it is still visible to the naked eye above the infant\u2019s head and in front of the standing dog (fig. 27.45 and fig. 27.46).\n\nThe infrared reflectogram indicates that the standing dog\u2019s tail was more substantial and curved down at the end when first painted, and that its head was not held down, but instead pointed more to the left. The artist also adjusted the size of the sleeping dog, which was initially larger. Although the back leg was in the same position, the forehead and ears were bigger, and its back touched the woman\u2019s skirt (fig. 27.47). To make the head smaller, Gauguin first painted over much of the larger head with the green of the surrounding foreground, as is visible in his snout.\n\nAfter the intermittent blue lay-in for the skirt of the woman standing at far right, it was painted a paler blue-gray before Gauguin changed it to dark blue (fig. 27.48). The skirt was initially wider on the left, extending to the same width as the red shawl. He scumbled over the strong red of the shawl with thin strokes of gray to tone its brightness back (fig. 27.49). Her proper right arm was previously articulated at her hip, as revealed by the red still visible under the blue of the hibiscus bush at the right edge. And there appear to be remnants of a blue line for the same arm in a slightly raised position, which Gauguin sketched and then rubbed out.\n\nRather than painting the man\u2019s hands first and then adding a bit of coconut between them, Gauguin painted the entire coconut section and then added the man\u2019s hand over it (fig. 27.50). As first painted, the man had stronger silhouetted features that have been partially painted out, and his pareu was a darker blue, similar to the final color of the standing woman\u2019s skirt, before being lightened.\n\nGauguin first concentrated on the sky and upper landscape, then the figures, and then the foreground meadow, where the figures appear carefully staged. For the sky Gauguin laid down a highly textured lead white oil paint directly over the ground. This oil layer would resist the sinking in of the overlying colors as well as provide additional texture under the sky and smaller branches (fig. 27.51; see Paint Layer). With the lead white he skirted around the major branches, which had already been drawn; he sketched and painted the thinner branches and the foliage on top of it. The lead white passages have small granular inclusions visible under the stereomicroscope that add a slightly bumpy surface to the textured white. Light catching the textured surface of the misty sky creates a palpable atmospheric effect. In these upper branches Gauguin worked more freely and quickly, often skimming the branches over the rough texture of the white underlayer. A wider 4 mm brush was used more frequently in the top portion, where the more highly textured, edgy brushstrokes catch the light and impart a greater sense of movement. Gauguin also varied the texture with his brushwork in the final layers: lifting the paint into small ridges and peaks of impasto, pouncing it for an almost flocked effect, and wiping and brushing the paint out in varied directions to create smoother areas of greater translucency (fig. 27.52, and fig. 27.53). The rough underlying texture not only broke up the brushwork but also caught paint intermittently as the brush crisscrossed along the branches, the intermittent edges of the branches serving as modeling, especially when wiped (fig. 27.54).\n\nGauguin used a number of devices to increase the presence of the big tree. A mist is suggested by the exaggerated atmospheric perspective that Gauguin employed behind the big tree (see fig. 27.55). With the cooler tones and lower contrast of blue trees receding behind it, extra pictorial space is created around the big tree. The tree\u2019s space becomes more expansive still by the added device of hanging decorative tendrils from its front branch. The eye-catching detail of these tendrils at the front of the tree and the more open sky behind the tree, its darker, thick branches with strong contour lines, and its colorful, highly contrasting bark against the pale, indistinct background, are all techniques used by Gauguin to strengthen the tree\u2019s dominant presence within the landscape. As he added the long twisting branches higher up in the tree, adorned with airy puffs of foliage simply formed by curled dashes of paint, he worked back and forth between foliage and sky, cutting one into another, or reaffirming their edges (fig. 27.56 and fig. 27.57).\n\nThis lively and varied treatment of the big tree contrasts markedly with the more solid masses of greenery in the placid scene below. The foreground was built up slowly by layering groups of soft, translucent, hatched strokes, often wet-into-wet in fluid paint, and with amorphous washes that shift with slow subtlety from one hue to another, moving from yellow to green to blue-green and blue, then back to green and yellow, thus creating the appearance of softly shimmering sunlight on the scene (see fig. 27.55). Gauguin used a larger 4 mm brush late in the process for the vertical green grass in the foreground, where a firm pressure has pushed the extra fluid paint to the edges of each stroke, creating the appearance of two parallel strokes.\n\nThe forms along the left edge remain as initially blocked in with blue outlines and flat color (fig. 27.58). This stark, almost unfinished appearance contrasts with the highly worked big tree and with the technique Gauguin explored in the hedge to create a sense of depth. The hedge began with a vigorous diagonally stroked lay-in of blue-green, as seen in the transmitted-infrared image (fig. 27.59). He added blue branches, occasional red flowers, and touches of other colors and then stretched a thin film of olive green over each bush, lending them an inflated appearance. Gauguin dry brushed the green from the center out to thin it, then added a highlight (see fig. 27.55). This band of soft, dull green acts as a foil for the brighter, purer colors in the rest of the picture. The dark-green foliage on left edge has a brilliant transparent turquoise underlayer, covered with dull blue and dull green. These duller layers were wiped in areas while still wet, so the dark color remains mostly in the interstices and the underlying turquoise is revealed (fig. 27.60).\n\nThe linear brushwork of the blue bush at the right edge differs from the other bushes but relates to the sinuous tree branches above. At the bottom of the bush, the blue lines suggest the form of a lying dog or of a woman with a hat, seated cross-legged and leaning forward. These are not lines from previous branch forms, but instead were added late in the process and reinforced by orange edges, as if to visually tease the viewer\u2019s perception with the possibility of these forms (fig. 27.61).\n\nGauguin primarily used small brushes. A soft, flat-end 2 mm brush was most frequently used. A stiffer 4 mm brush was also used (estimated based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, red and yellow iron oxides, emerald green, viridian, chrome yellow (possibly two types), vermilion, red lead, red lake, cobalt blue, Prussian blue, ultramarine blue, burnt sienna, traces of black and dark brown particles.\n\nThe red lake was identified as madder lake. A substrate of aluminum and phosphorus was identified. A tin and possibly calcium substrate was found in one sample, suggesting the possible presence of two different red lakes.\n\nOil (estimated). Most areas of paint are extremely fluid, with very little body, as though diluted with extra medium and/or turpentine.\n\nThere is a surface coating of beeswax directly on the paint layer (fig. 27.62). This wax is probably an original coating. The waxed surface must have remained unvarnished for some time, because there was an ensuing layer of grime that built up before a natural-resin varnish was applied. This later varnish has now been removed, but the original wax coating underneath remains (fig. 27.63).\n\nBefore 1949: Painting received an aqueous lining.\n\nNov. 1949: Cleaned (whether this was a varnish removal or grime cleaning was not stated). Inpainted and revarnished with natural resin varnish.\n\nMay 1960: Consolidation and grime removal took place.\n\nNov. 1996: The natural-resin varnish was removed. In places, a very thin residual amount of this natural-resin varnish was left on the surface for color saturation. Unnecessary repaint in areas where Gauguin had allowed the canvas fibers to show was removed. A large area of old repaint above an old tear was toned, and small losses around the edges were filled and retouched.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition. At some point before it entered the collection of the Art Institute, 0.5 cm of original paint was folded over the left edge and slightly less over the top edge; these are the current foldovers. There is an old filled tear across the trunk of the tall almond tree in front of the hut, with insoluble old retouching (fig. 27.64). There is some minor abrasion of very thin paint layers, especially toward the edges. This abrasion is probably from cleaning, or possibly facing removal after lining, but some may be wiping by the artist. There are tiny losses where the ground and paint had bridged gaps between threads in the jute canvas and essentially had no support. There is a network of fine cracks running in all directions, but many cracks are disguised by the wax on the surface. The wax coating is slightly grimy and is now slightly cloudy in some areas. A minimal glue residue remains on the surface from the lining process and is slightly cloudy and crizzled in a few spots.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister\n\nCurrent frame (installed by 1933): The work is framed in a late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, French, Louis XIV ogee frame with lambrequin corner and shell center cartouches connected by foliate c-scrolls and dividing fleur-de-lis. The frame has both water and oil gilding on red bole over gesso and cast plaster ornament. The sanded frieze has been painted with an opaque ocher. The frame is mitered and nailed, the original construction of the inner and outer edge boards has been filled with a back frame glued in place, the rebate of the frame has been enlarged, and the sight molding has additional wood glued to the inside face. The interior and back of the frame are overpainted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight outer side; ovolo with a dentil pattern, with alternating dentils hollowed; scotia side with thumb top; ogee face with cast plaster ornament of lambrequin corner and shell-center cartouches connected by foliate c-scrolls on a quadrillage bed and dividing foliate bracketed fleurs-de-lis and bellflowers on a double-lined diamond bed; convex; fillet; sanded frieze; fillet; and ogee sight edge with a running c-scroll bellflower ornament (fig. 27.65 and fig. 27.66).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Label  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten in blue crayon on brown paper tape  \nContent: Ra\u2026f(?)\u2026(illegible) 6205 / P(?)6711(?)0 (fig. 27.67)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten in red pencil  \nContents: CHICAGO 9 (fig. 27.68)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten on printed label, torn  \nContent: 1 / . . . uguin / Underskrift (fig. 27.69)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: handwritten in pencil  \nContent: 7 / Gall. 41 (fig. 27.70)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar  \nMethod: handwritten in black crayon  \nContent: 10 (circled) (fig. 27.71)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar  \nMethod: red paper dot (fig. 27.72)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar  \nMethod: stamped in black ink  \nContent: CHESTER H.

Power at the samples was kept very low (never exceeding a few mW) by a series of neutral density filters in order to avoid any thermal damage.\n\nSamples were mounted on a Specac diamond compression cell for analysis by MFTIR. Data were collected in transmission mode between 4000 and 400 cm-1 at 4 cm-1 resolution and 128 scans per spectrum using a Bruker Hyperion microscope with MCT D315 detector, interfaced to a Tensor 27 spectrometer bench.\n\nThe samples were derivatized using a 1:1 mixture of benzene and MethPrep II (Alltech: [m-trifluoromethylphenyl]trimethylammonium hydroxide, 0.2 N in methanol). After leaving overnight at room temperature, the reaction vial was centrifuged and 1 \u03bcL of the sample solution was injected into the gas chromatograph (GC). A Varian 3800 GC was used with a Restek Rxi-5ms column (30 m, 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 \u03bcm film), interfaced to a Saturn 2200 mass spectrometer. The GC inlet temperature was 300\u00ba C and the MS transfer line 300\u00ba C. The oven was programmed from 45\u00ba C, with a two-minute hold, then increased at 20\u00ba C/min to 85\u00ba C and at 15\u00ba C/min to 310\u00ba C, and held isothermally for 21 minutes; total run time 40 minutes. The inlet was operated in splitless mode with helium as the carrier gas, at a constant flow of 1 mL/min.

Richard Field suggested an order for these works that places the Art Institute\u2019s picture as the sixth realized in Tahiti in part because it exhibits \u201ca greater tendency towards description\u201d than those he identifies as preceding it. Field assumes that despite Gauguin\u2019s telling friends that he had yet to sufficiently study his environment to begin painting, he had indeed begun to do so while still in his research phase. See Richard S. Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Trip to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), pp. 309\u201316. Further technical investigation of the corpus of 1891 pictures may eventually yield information that can complement and refine the observations and formal analysis that inform Field\u2019s ordering.\n\nSee Paul Gauguin, Avant and apr\u00e8s, facsimile ed.

The exception to Gauguin\u2019s habitual practice was Arles; this can be explained by the presence of his housemate Vincent van Gogh, who, from the moment Gauguin arrived, was insistent that he join him in painting.\n\nGauguin to Mette Gauguin, summer 1891, in The Writings of a Savage, ed.

Gauguin requested that Monfreid forward these eight paintings on to Mette, and he wrote to his wife the same day, telling her that she should be expecting a shipment of paintings from Monfreid; see Gauguin to Mette Gauguin, Dec. 8, 1892, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 sa femme et \u00e0 ses amis, ed. Maurice Malingue (B. Grasset, 1946), p. 236, no. 134. In this letter Gauguin again lists the same eight pictures he mentioned to Monfreid and adds one more\u2014Te vahine note tiare, with a French translation La femme \u00e0 la fleur. It is important to note that in the letter to Mette, Te raau rahi was translated by Gauguin as Le grand arbre. Gauguin further cautioned Mette that these translations are \u201cfor you only so that you may give [them] to those who ask . . . But I want the titles in the catalogue to be the same as those on the picture[s].

Stenning (World, 1949), p. 177, no. 134. On examining the two lists, it appears that the French titles included in Gauguin\u2019s letter to Monfreid are more descriptive of the composition itself, and those included in his letter to Mette are closer to a direct translation of the Tahitian title.\n\nSee Richard S.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with stereomicroscopic examination, indicates that the signature\u2019s paint mixture may contain cobalt blue, lead white, zinc white, and iron oxide containing pigments(s) and/or Prussian blue.

These included Le paysage grand arbre\u2014Te raau rahi. Gauguin split the list into two categories; just before the second group of four he made a request: \u201cVeuillez mettre les titres suivants \u00e0 ceux qui n\u2019en ont pas\u201d (Please put the following titles on those [paintings] that do not have one). Among these four is Le paysage grand arbre\u2014Te raau rahi, although this could refer to another painting entitled Te raau rahi (1891; Cleveland Museum of Art [W 437]). Gauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 8, 1892, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 Daniel de Monfreid, ed. Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 62, no. 8. Translation by Genevieve Westerby. See Commentary.\n\nPossibly the first inscription had not adhered well. This was likely the case if the painting\u2019s surface had first been waxed by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid at the request of the artist. Gauguin sent a cache of paintings to Monfreid that included a painting titled Le paysage grand arbre\u2014Te raau rahi with instructions, including treatment of the canvases: \u201cVous les laverez avec soin et beaucoup de precautions pour ne pas enlever la peinture et la preparation et vous cirerez\u201d (You will wash them [the paintings] carefully and with many precautions so as not to remove the paint and the preparation and [then] you will wax [them]). Gauguin to Monfreid, Dec. 8, 1892, in Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 Daniel de Monfreid, ed.

Travers Newton, Jr., Technique and Meaning in the Paintings of Paul Gauguin (Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 208.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with stereomicroscopic examination, indicates that the paint mixture includes iron oxide\u2013containing pigments, lead white, and zinc white.

The thicker paint and admixture of white would aid in covering the remnants of the older inscription.\n\nJute was confirmed by microscopic fiber analysis; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1949\\_513\\_ Gauguin\\_BigTree\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Aug. 26, 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis was the size Gauguin most commonly used at this time. He wrote to his wife, Mette, that he had completed thirty-two canvases, twenty-eight of which had the dimensions 70 \u00d7 90 cm (his approximation of a standard-format no. 30 canvas). See Lettres de Gauguin \u00e0 sa femme et \u00e0 ses amis, ed. Maurice Malingue (B. Grasset, 1946), p. 230, no. 130, which dates the letter to July 1892. The letter was redated to April 1892 by Richard S. Field in Field, Paul Gauguin: The Paintings of the First Trip to Tahiti (Garland, 1977), p. 361, no. 11.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See C. Richard Johnson, Jr., Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \"Thread Count Report, The Big Tree (Te raau rahi), Paul Gauguin, 1891 (W439/1949.513), January 2014.\"\n\nThis is to be expected on a canvas that had been primed on the stretcher rather than cut from a larger primed piece. When the ground is applied, it sets the cusping from the original stretching.\n\nThere are no supplier marks on the stretcher, and the artist stretched and primed the jute himself.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to the chalk-and-glue ground and aqueous lining.\n\nIn contrast, the palette knife tends to press the material flat. There is also no distinct outer edge to the ground, as a knife application usually produces, so it is likely the edges were brushed out.\n\nThe bottom and right edges are the most visible and least damaged edges. The left and top edges have been folded over and covered with paper tape.\n\nThe ground was analyzed with PLM, XRF and SEM/EDX. Traces include magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and potassium, indicating silicate minerals present in the chalk. Traces of barite were also found in one sample by SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1949\\_513\\_ Gauguin\\_BigTree\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Aug. 26, 2015; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cGaug\\_BigTree\\_1949\\_523\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 13, 2013, both on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. Traces include magnesium, aluminum, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and potassium, indicating silicate minerals present in the chalk. Traces of barite were also found in one sample by SEM/EDX.\n\nThe medium of the ground was not analyzed but is assumed to be glue.\n\nLead white identified by SEM/EDX; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1949\\_513\\_Gauguin\\_BigTree\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Aug. 26, 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThese leaves were identified as breadfruit by their shape, even though a breadfruit tree is not identifiable in the painted scene. Peter Zegers, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago, has studied the flora of Polynesia and made the identification.\n\nAnalyzed by PLM; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1949\\_513\\_ Gauguin\\_BigTree\\_analytical\\_report\u201d Aug. 26, 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. Viridian, vermilion, and chrome yellow were also present but may be from the underlying meadow.\n\nPeter Zegers, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago, has studied the flora of Polynesia and made the identification.\n\nGauguin used this technique again, holding a figure in reserve but painting the legs over the lay-in, when he painted the standing woman in No te aha oe riri (Why Are You Angry?) (cat. 90).\n\nAlthough the pareu appears to stop short at the back in the infrared reflectogram, this is simply due to Gauguin\u2019s use of different shades of blue.\n\nThe hotu tree (fish poison tree [Barringtonia asiatica]) was identified by Peter Zegers, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago, who has studied Polynesian flora.\n\nThe top layers of the water were painted after the foreground was completed, and mix wet-into-wet with the man\u2019s orange legs and their blue contour lines.\n\nThe scumble has since been partially abraded, probably in cleaning. The darker scattered marks on the shawl are remnants of a later accretion.\n\nPareu in Tahitian refers to a sarong worn by both men and women.\n\nPossibly the granules were not added by Gauguin, but were the result of metal soap formation as the painting aged.\n\nGauguin commented on his distaste for flashy brushwork and impasto in a letter to Bernard: \u201cAu point de vue de la couleur [Van Gogh] voit les hasards de la p\u00e2te comme chez Monticelli et moi je d\u00e9teste le tripotage de la facture etc.\u201d (As for color, he [Van Gogh] appreciates the haphazardness of thick paint, as in the work of Monticelli, while I dislike the tampering with brushwork, etc.). Gauguin to \u00c9mile Bernard, [second half of Nov. 1888], in Victor Merlh\u00e8s, ed., Correspondance de Paul Gauguin: Documents; T\u00e9moignages, vol. 1, 1873\u20131888 (Fondation Singer-Polignac, 1984) p. 284, no. 182; translation by Camille Grand-Dewyse. Gauguin\u2019s own manipulation of the paint surface with the brush is so understated that it is barely visible and acts to break up any hint of facile brushwork.\n\nThe dark foliage on the right edge has thin scumbles of yellow, which lend a similar sense of volume.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, zinc white, iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow, chrome yellow, emerald green, viridian, vermilion, cobalt blue (XRF); lead white, chrome yellow (possibly two varieties of yellow: a lemon yellow and a medium yellow), iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, vermilion, red lead, red lake, burnt sienna, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, cobalt blue, emerald green, viridian, traces of black and dark brown particles (PLM); lead white, zinc white, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, Prussian blue (SEM/EDX); and zinc white, lead white, iron oxides and silicates, cobalt blue, chromium-containing pigments and vermilion (electron microprobe).

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s technique and published analyses of Gauguin\u2019s paintings.\n\nBeeswax was identified by GCMS and FTIR; Ken Sutherland, \u201c1949\\_513 gauguin big tree coating report,\u201d Aug. 14, 2013, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGauguin sent a cache of paintings to Monfreid with instructions, including treatment of the canvases: \u201cVous les laverez avec soin et beaucoup de precautions pour ne pas enlever la peinture et la preparation et vous cirerez\u201d (You will wash them [the paintings] carefully and with many precautions so as not to remove the paint and the preparation and [then] you will wax [them]).
