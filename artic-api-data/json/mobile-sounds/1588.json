    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This plaster sculpture made in 1926 by the Belgian artist Georges Vantongerloo is based on his belief in the eternal beauty of geometric forms. Curator Stephanie D'Alessandro.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: It may initially seem like a very strict, very static, very abstract and almost impersonal kind of work, something that is very much based on math or science or perfect proportion. But the hand of the artist is very much there. There\u2019s a sense of invention. You can see the way that he put these forms together. After World War War I artists looked back on the work that they had made and found out many of the forms that they had chosen to use in the past, painting in a representational style, let\u2019s say, didn\u2019t have the same meaning after the war. And they began to search for new forms. In particular, artists looked to art to heal society and some of the works that we\u2019re looking at in this gallery have to do with that effort.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Vantongerloo and other artists associated with the Dutch artist movement known as De Stijl, or \u201cthe style\u201d, believed in the universal language of abstraction.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: One of the most important factors of the style was a true non-representational kind of form looking to geometric shapes and pure line as a kind of static peaceful kind of blank slate in a way and pure color-- the primary colors of red, yellow, and blue and the additional colors of white and black and gray.</p>\n",
