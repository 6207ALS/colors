    "description": "<p>The most influential and enduring progressive printmaking collective of its time, the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular (the Popular Graphic Art Workshop or TGP; 1937\u20132010) created some of the most memorable images in midcentury printmaking. This Mexico City\u2013based workshop took up the legacy of the famous Mexican broadside illustrator <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36247/jose-guadalupe-posada\" target=\"_blank\">Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Posada</a>, creating prints, posters, and illustrated publications that were popular, affordable, legible, politically topical, and, above all, formally compelling.</p><p>Founded in 1937 by <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35738/leopoldo-mendez\" target=\"_blank\">Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez</a>, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/44796/luis-arenal\" target=\"_blank\">Luis Arenal</a>, and American-born <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36065/pablo-o-higgins\" target=\"_blank\">Pablo O\u2019Higgins</a>, the TGP emerged and evolved in the crucible of anti-fascist and leftist politics in Mexico in the period surrounding World War II. This environment shaped not only the workshop\u2019s dedication to a collective printmaking model but also its production aimed at both \u201cthe people\u201d and discerning collectors, a strategy necessitated by the era\u2019s quickly changing political tides. The collective created works for groups spanning the leftist and progressive political spectrum, including the government of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and his successors, the Mexican Communist Party, major trade unions, and anti-fascist organizations.</p><p>During the TGP\u2019s heyday, from its founding until the 1950s, the workshop produced thousands of prints, primarily linocuts and lithographs, for everything from ephemeral handbills and newspapers to political and advertising posters to luxe portfolios and printed books. Through an expressive, realist visual language, TGP\u2019s work addressed a wide range of socially engaged themes, including Mexican history and culture, both local and international political satires (including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=calavera%20broadsides\" target=\"_blank\">calavera broadsides</a>), rural and urban scenes of daily life, and agitprop prints. The members of the workshop, a core of about 40 during its height, produced both individual and collective works and welcomed numbers of foreign members and guest artists\u2014from <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/42649/elizabeth-catlett\" target=\"_blank\">Elizabeth Catlett</a> to <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33371/josef-albers\" target=\"_blank\">Josef Albers</a>\u2014to use the workshop in order to collaborate on prints and create individual pieces.</p><p>The Art Institute holds <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=%22Taller%20de%20Gr%C3%A1fica%20Popular%22\" target=\"_blank\">over 100 works</a> by the TGP, one of the most significant collections in the United States and a testament to the collective\u2019s expansive influence, which led to the establishment of print collectives around the world.</p>",
