    "description": "<p>Emerging in the early 1970s amid new genres of land art, performance art, film and video, and feminist practices, artist Ana Mendieta developed a deeply personal, experimental, and largely ephemeral oeuvre consisting chiefly of performative actions that she described as \u201cearth-body sculptures.\u201d Born in Cuba, Mendieta came to the United States as a refugee in 1961 at the age of 12. The trauma of separation from her family, culture, and homeland became the bedrock of the artist\u2019s practice, which was rooted in physical and spiritual connections between the body and the natural world. The <em>Silueta</em> series\u2014hundreds of earth-body sculptures and their attendant photographs and films\u2014constitutes the core of Mendieta\u2019s project. Based initially on the artist\u2019s own body and silhouette, the <em>Siluetas</em> developed into a panopoly of archetypal goddess figures and eventually more universal human forms. They also incorporated a unique blend of ritual effects drawn from diverse religious practices in much the same way as studio performances <em>Untitled</em> (Body Tracks) and <em>Untitled (Blood Sign #1)</em>, in which she used animal blood. An intensely productive period of travel to Cuba, where Mendieta felt her practice was reconnected with its origins, promoted these and other drawings, etching, and sculptures in which, for the first, her iconic goddess forms became permanent individual objects.</p>\n",
