    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  In the late nineteenth century the picturesque little towns on the river Seine just west of Paris became popular destinations for Parisians wanting to enjoy a day out. This is one of many paintings made by Renoir at the restaurant Fournaise, which overlooked the river. The two men and a woman sit on one of the restaurant\u2019s river terraces enjoying the summer afternoon after a leisurely lunch. They may all have spent the morning in more active pursuits. The man to the left was a well-known patron of a swimming establishment nearby. His friend to the right is dressed in a rower\u2019s white shirt and pants, and their companion wears a female boater\u2019s blue costume, as does the woman we see through the trellis. Beyond her a racing boat cuts through the water at a faster pace. On the terrace Renoir evokes the atmosphere of relaxation and quietness as the party lingers over wine and fruit. His soft, loose brushwork perfectly conveys the slightly hazy afternoon light. It filters through the trellis to fall glowingly on the men\u2019s white costumes, and the thicker paint application highlights the edges of the wine glasses and decanter with points of dazzling dancing brilliance.</p>\n",
