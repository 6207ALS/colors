    "description": "<p>In 1933, Arthur Dove and his wife, Helen Torr, moved to Geneva, New York, where Dove had been raised, to settle his family\u2019s estate following the death of his mother. Although ambivalent about returning to his childhood home, Dove found renewed inspiration in the local landscape and began exploring it in depth, making numerous sketches and watercolors that became the basis for canvases such as <em>Cross and Weather Vane</em>. The composition incorporates several natural motifs such as trees, rolling hills, and the round orb of the sun that recur with frequency in Dove\u2019s work and affirm his passion for nature. These elements mingle harmoniously with the manmade objects in the painting, such as the arrow-shaped weather vane, which seems to take flight like a bird. The small brown cross, which appears to be embedded in a gray, rocklike form, serves as a reminder of Dove\u2019s belief in the interconnectedness of spirituality and nature.</p>\n",
