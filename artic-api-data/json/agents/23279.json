    "description": "<p>The innovative printmaker Martin Schongauer played a crucial role in the development of engraving, bringing a new tonal richness to the medium, as well as an unprecedented skill in the rendition of surfaces and textures. Although he was active in the Rhine Valley (on the border between modern-day France and Germany), Schongauer\u2019s influence spread across Europe through the 116 engravings he produced beginning around 1470.&nbsp;</p><p>Schongauer\u2019s early training as a goldsmith is evident in the refined engraving technique and the attention to minute surface decoration he displays in works such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/86268/the-censer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Censer</em></a>.<em> </em>In <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/29317/the-death-of-the-virgin\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Death of the Virgin</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20352/the-road-to-calvary\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Road to Calvary</em></a>, on the other hand, Schongauer\u2019s rendition of complex spaces, solid volumes, and tonal variation reflect his parallel practice in painting. Later, as in his restrained <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/68112/st-sebastian\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Saint Sebastian</em></a>, Schongauer moved toward greater simplicity, giving prominence to the calligraphic beauty of black lines set against white paper.&nbsp;</p><p>The Art Institute owns a remarkable collection of prints by Schongauer. Among the approximately 100 works are examples of his major achievements, as well as rare works by his early <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4019/the-battle-of-st-james-the-greater-at-clavijo\" target=\"_blank\">followers</a> and imitators. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/collection?q=%22after%20Martin%20Schongauer%22%20\" target=\"_blank\">copies</a> of his compositions by other printmakers\u2014such as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/37116/israhel-van-meckenem-the-younger\" target=\"_blank\">Israhel van Meckenem</a>, who reproduced 58 of his prints, and the Netherlandish <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/43486/master-f-v-b\" target=\"_blank\">Master F.V.B.</a>, who made a <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/56691/ornament-with-owl-mocked-by-day-birds\" target=\"_blank\">reversed copy</a> of an <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4016/ornament-with-owl-mocked-by-day-birds\" target=\"_blank\">ornamental design</a> by Schongauer\u2014are eloquent indications of Schongauer\u2019s influence and fame. Even during his lifetime Schongauer\u2019s renown extended beyond borders: in 1487 in Florence, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33808/michelangelo-buonarroti\" target=\"_blank\">Michelangelo</a> saw an impression of the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/84751/the-temptation-of-saint-anthony\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Temptation of Saint Anthony</em></a> and made a copy of it\u2014this was Michelangelo\u2019s first known painting.</p>",
