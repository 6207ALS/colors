    "transcript": "<p>Number 3-7-8. City Landscape, by American artist Joan Mitchell. Painted in 1955. Oil on linen. 6 feet 8 inches square.</p>\n<p>In this abstract painting, a tangled mass of bright color spreads out across the center of the canvas, with areas of paler tones above and below.</p>\n<p>In the central area, which extends across almost the full width of the image, the colors have been applied very densely: larger patches and smears combine with smaller daubs, blobs and drips. The colors have been laid over and over each other, so no single color predominates. Instead, there is a layered mass of deep purple, pink, orange, bright blue, khaki, olive green and mustard yellow. In the areas above and below, the paint has been applied in blocks of color \u2013 pale gray, cream and white mingled with hints of blue and pink. Even within these larger expanses of color, the brushstrokes are visible, creating a streaked, sketchy appearance. Drips, streaks and thin lines of color trail out from the central mass to punctuate these paler areas.</p>\n<p>To hear an interpretive commentary on this work, press 1-2-3.</p>\n",
