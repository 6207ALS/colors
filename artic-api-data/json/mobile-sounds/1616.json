    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The thrilling equestrian and acrobatic displays of Parisian circuses were rich source of inspiration to late nineteenth century artists. This painting by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec shows the Cirque Fernando, located in the bohemian Montmartre neighborhood where he lived. Lautrec went on to make many posters for clients, such as the Moulin Rouge nightclub. He was among the first artists to exploit the attributes of poster making in his paintings, such as large, legible images, a reduced range of colors, and a caricature-like style. Here, he focuses his caricaturist talents on the ringmaster, who menacingly whips the horse toward a paper hoop, through which the female acrobat must jump. The glance exchanged by the two performers crackles with tension. Its intensity contrasts strikingly with the impassive presence of the perfectly dressed bourgeois audience. Several of the spectators like the clowns are cropped abruptly by the edges of the canvas. Lautrec adapted this compositional technique in the flattened linear way he portrayed the figures from Japanese prints. These had become enormously popular and influential among avant-garde artists.</p>\n",
