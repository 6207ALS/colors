    "description": "<p>After delaying his education to serve in the Second World War, Rosofsky renewed his studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1946. Marked by featureless figures and confined space, his work from the 1950s has a monstrous quality. Rosofsky was influenced by the bleak postwar conditions he witnessed in Occupied Germany as well as the retrospectives of Edvard Munch, Alberto Giacometti, and others held at the Art Institute. His early interest in human frailty would continue throughout his career.</p>\n",
