    "copy": " For the sixth year in a row , intrepid art explorer Sophie took time out of her busy summer to tour with me through the galleries. We took a walk through America after the Fall: Painting in the 1930s and as we were headed in, I asked Sophie what she knew about the decade. \u201cThe Great Depression,\u201d she said. And that\u2019s an appropriate reference point because the \u201cfall\u201d in the title refers to the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, and the exhibition includes work from that moment in time through the United States\u2019 entry into World War II in 1941. We talked about how diverse the landscapes were throughout the show, from energetic and crowded cities to quiet and isolated rural America. In fact, as artists were trying to determine what was truly \u201cAmerican\u201d about American art, many took a regionalist approach and focused on the working class. From Grant Wood featuring Iowa farmers to Marsden Hartley showcasing the Maine landscape, these artists highlighted people and places that had been previously ignored. We also talked about what she saw in the paintings\u2014road trips, ghost towns, farming, factories\u2014but more often than not, we talked about how the people in the paintings might be feeling. She frequently used words like \u201ctired,\u201d \u201csad,\u201d and \u201chopeless,\u201d and described people as \u201cwishing for a better job\u201d or \u201conce really happy, but not any more.\u201d When you begin to look past the narratives in the paintings, you see how artists like Edward Hopper and Ivan Albright accurately captured the disillusionment that so many people were experiencing during that tumultuous decade.   One of her favorite works in the show\u2014the Art Institute\u2019s own Thanksgiving , pictured above\u2014is decidedly more optimistic. She liked how bustling and candid the painting seemed and when she noticed how lived in the space seemed, she decided that maybe the house had been in the family for generations. She was also quick to note that there were clearly more family members present outside the frame since there are only women featured in the painting (save one small boy in the background). Visit this exhibition before it closes on September 18 and when you do, take a closer look at the people in the paintings. It\u2019s a complementary history lesson that you won\u2019t want to miss. And thanks as always to Sophie for her insightful perspective! \u2014Katie Rahn ",
