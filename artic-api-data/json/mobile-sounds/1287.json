    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This large scale bronze dating from about the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. depicts Dionysus the god of wine and theater who was worshiped widely throughout the Mediterranean. This statue was probably made in the area of present day Syria, Lebanon and Israel. The son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and Semele, a mortal, Dionysius was in Roman times often portrayed as he is here as an adolescent youth. His lips may have originally been wrought from copper and his flowing locks of hair echo a style often worn by athletes or gods. It\u2019s bound by a thin headband and a twisted grapevine which once may have had leaves and grapes. His gently curled right hand probably cradled a bunch of grapes or a kantharos, a long handled wine cup. His left hand would have held a thyrsus, a staff topped with a pinecone that was associated with the worship of Dionysus. In Greek vase painting and Roman sculpture, Dionysus is usually shown surrounded by satyrs, half-human half-beast and a retinue of female followers. In his role as the god of theater, his followers were known for staging elaborate festivals marked by drinking, dancing and feasting, the extreme of which left participants in a trance like state of ekstasis, the origin of the English word ecstasy. To this day, the adjective Dionysian describes unbridled celebration and excess.</p>\n",
