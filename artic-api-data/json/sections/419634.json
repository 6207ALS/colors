Paris  \n[2 August 1894]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014I suppose then you are printing the \u201cLong Gallery\u2014Louvre\u201d for this number of the Studio\u2014\n\nIt is quite understood with Mr. White and Mr. Holmes that you proceed with this as you did with my former drawing\u2014so / that\u2019s all right\u2014One thing\u2014Of course you will have on their print, always the name of the Publication, somewhere in small type\u2014You might think that I would object to it\u2014but no\u2014it would also go to make another distinction between the prints and my own proofs.\u2014\n\nI doubt not that by this you will have heard from Mr. Thomson\u2014and that will be all right too\u2014\n\nDo you know I don\u2019t really like this Austrian paper\u2014I hate the grain\u2014fine as you make it\u2014I must try something else\u2014\n\nMind you dont squeeze your fresh proofs into a horrid pasteboard roller again!\u2014to be degraded still further in the Post. /\n\nYou still have paper, Dutch and other\u2014have n\u2019t you?\u2014And have n\u2019t you my other proofs for me this week? The remaining of the 25 each\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]  \n\nWill see about the stump.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. [Paris]  \nAug 7. 1894.\n\nThe proofs arrived safely and are very beautiful\u2014It was quite a pleasure to see them again on the Dutch paper, than which really nothing is finer\u2014Your own little stump work in the marine is capital\u2014and we like it very much.\n\nSent you yesterday more Japanese and Dutch, and in the middle of the package what I fancy is perhaps the best drawing I have done\u2014The \u201cBlanchiseuse de la Place Dauphine\u201d\u2014It has no stump and ought to come out perfectly\u2014Do write at once to say that it arrived safely. You had better let Thomson know about the chance for printing his before the other\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n21 Wellington St.  \nLondon WC.  \nAugust 11/[18]94\n\nDear Mr. Whistler\n\nI am writing to you from the sea side, having arranged with Henry this morning to send you your proofs etc. I hope you will like them but what you will think of the mixture of papers I dont know! The children of Israel complained when called on to make bricks without straw but were at anyrate allowed to supply some themselves\u2014how much harder our lot, when you reject our paper and supply us 13 dutch and 8 Japaneese sheets to print 4 proofs / and 42 impressions!!! I have mixed up all sorts of old rejected stuff to spin out enough, and now have nothing at all left to pull even the proofs of the new drawing which came safely this morning. Do send us over a respectable amount please! What is the subject of the new drawing? it is very good, and I much like the Laundresses. What an awkward corner Mr. Thomson is putting you in. Mr. White came down yesterday to ask us to proceed with the Picture Gallery [cat. 86] as they want to have as much time to get it as perfectly printed as possible. I think The Art Journal is most unreasonable in their asking further delay.\n\nwith kind regards to Mrs. Whistler and Yourself\n\nI remain yours very Sincerely  \nTom R Way\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac\u2014Paris  \nSunday. [12 August 1894]\n\nMy dear Tom. The proofs that Mr. Morgan promised for fridays post have not come\u2014and I am a bit disappointed\u2014\n\nI am most anxious to see the new ones and to have the remaining of the other sets of (25)\n\nI have got / hold of a new paper!!\u2014of this more news shortly\u2014\n\nLet me hear from you first\u2014  \n\nKindest messages.  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac\u2014Paris\u2014  \nTuesday\u2014[14 August 1894]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014The proofs are beautiful\u2014and now I can send in another 50 odd old Dutch paper of an exquisite quality\u2014I would use it on the Blanchiseuse [cat. 93]\u2014and some on the last drawing which I call the \u201cLate Piquet \u201d\u2014and some on this new drawing I now pack with the paper if you succeed with it\u2014\u201cLa Rue de Furstenburg\u201d\u2014I say \u201cif you succeed\u201d\u2014not that I doubt that your Father will manage it all right\u2014Only I will give you the straight tip\u2014and the reason why once before with a French paper of something of the same kind you missed it and the drawings were \u201csmashed\u201d\u2014This kind of paper must be laid down on a grained stone!\u2014That\u2019s whats the matter! They will not take on the smooth polished stone\u2014as the grained German paper does\u2014\n\nNow I am most anxious that this should succeed! and then I will send more elaborate ones\u2014They \u201cd\u00e9calquer\u201d this paper here at Lemercier / where I tried a preliminary drawing, but then of course they have not your Father\u2019s art, and the biting in was feeble\u2014and the result weak and comparatively poor\u2014though the proof still looks like a drawing on paper\u2014absolutely\u2014\n\nOne other thing\u2014I thought that I had mentioned in one of my letters to you lately that\u2014(besides \u201cThe Reaper\u201d [cat. 89], which I don\u2019t like, and which we must destroy,) I didn\u2019t care for \u201cThe Porch\u201d [cat. 88], and didn\u2019t want any more proofs from it at present. I suppose however that I must have forgotten to tell you\u2014for you have printed the little batch and I regret the beautiful paper!\u2014Really all the paper of this last packet of proofs is exquisite\u2014and you had frightened me by supposing it very \u201cmixed\u201d\u2014Well now destroy at once the two drawings: \u201cThe Porch\u201d, and \u201cThe Reaper\u201d\u2014send me a destroyed proof of each on the commonest paper\u2014They are unfit for anything else\u2014and wipe off the stones\u2014Destroy also at the same time the \u201cMontesquiou\u201d portrait sending proof and wiping stone\u2014The time has come to weed out all that is unworthy\u2014And I am going to do much better than all this. In the meanwhile though I do like the Blanchiseuse! and also the Little Caf\u00e9 au Bois, / and indeed the \u201cLate Piquet \u201d! Doesn\u2019t your Father think them fine and very simple and direct? You see if you manage this new paper, it will lead to many things!\u2014\n\nI have written to Thomson\u2014  \n[signed with a butterfly] /  \n\nTry and get a rich result of this new thing.\u2014and put it on the stone at once.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac\u2014Paris  \nAug. 16. [1894]\n\nMost anxious to see proof of new drawing [cat. 97]! so that I may judge if I can continue to work and push further effects on this new paper, which is very pleasant to work on\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \nAug. 17. [1894]\n\nMy dear Way\u2014I was delighted to get your letter\u2014But you really must write a much more explicit one!\u2014\n\nI want to know what you think about this paper.\u2014I would like to go on with it, but don\u2019t know how far I am wasting the drawings themselves\u2014We all know what can be done with the Austrian paper\u2014but the grain is disagreable when we get into any dark / or rich effects\u2014\n\nNow does this new paper give to the stone the very sweet velvety quality that in working I seem to think I have obtained? or is that lost in the rolling up?\u2014\n\nDo you mean only that the grained stone will not allow of the same use in printing for periodicals for instance, such as the \u201cStudio\u201d or Art Journal, as does the smooth stone\u2014and that transfers cannot be taken?\u2014Is this your chief objection?\u2014Or indeed do you object\u2014 / I can\u2019t make out\u2014for you dont really say what you think of the \u201cRue Furstenburg\u201d\u2014or how in your opinion the drawing behaved\u2014\n\nOf course all this would be much more pleasantly got at over the salmon at \u201cSimpson\u2019s\u201d as of old!\u2014and perhaps one of these days soon that may yet come off\u2014\n\nBut meanwhile do tell me something more\u2014The proofs have not yet arrived and so today I am sending you another drawing\u2014Try and see how much it will give\u2014in the way of effect\u2014\n\nHow is it that you are not also / at the sea side with Tom?\n\nSelfishly I am only too glad that you are still in Wellington Street to help me in my experiments for I am still very much occupied with my lithographs!\n\nHow are you?\u2014\n\nIt is cold here and the Summer has rained itself miserably away!\u2014\n\nWith kindest remembrances from us all\n\nAlways sincerely  \nJ. McN. Whistler.\n\n110\\. Rue de Bac\u2014Paris\u2014  \nSunday. [19 August 1894]\n\nMy dear Way\u2014In the first place I must tell you how pleased I am with the proofs of the Rue de Furstenburg\u2014\n\nThey are much brighter than what I hoped for. There is I notice, a difference between one, which I trust is the first\u2014and the others which are much richer\u2014Now if these be the later ones I suppose the stone will always give them of that quality. The inequalities you speak of in your letter I believe are due to the fact of this paper not / being the best of its kind\u2014that is I fancy that I can by and bye get that kind of paper from a better maker\u2014\n\nI notice myself, and it was pointed out to me by the Lemerciers that it was very poorly and unequally prepared\u2014and they showed me a last bit (they had no more in stock) much better \u201ccoll\u00e9\u201d\u2014That is the glue or gum was thicker and less cheaply spread upon it\u2014They will prepare some especially for me if I wish\u2014Meantime I am sending another specimen of theirs. They say that it is put upon the stone with great certainty\u2014One thing about it that ought to be nice for you, is that when the backing upon which it is pasted comes off on the stone, you can see through the transparent stuff and judge of how you wish to deal with it much better than you ever could with the opaque Austrian grained paper\u2014\n\nNow as to the grain on the stone\u2014I don\u2019t mind that\u2014but suppose you try a very finely grained stone this time?\u2014\n\nWe shall get at the right thing after a while\u2014But to come back to the Austrian paper\u2014Now look at the Blanchiseuse of la Place Dauphine\u2014Well you see that after all, unless it be a fancy of mine, these last proofs on the Dutch paper, are pale in the chiaroscuro\u2014I mean less rich than I would like\u2014It is true I might perhaps have got more tone or depth with a number 3 chalk\u2014 or if I had used the stump\u2014But I don\u2019t want the effect of much working\u2014and the more black one puts on, the more grain appears.\n\nWell we can only go on trying\u2014But at present my notion is that the Austrian paper is only all right for any open and rather slight sketches\u2014as for instance the \u201cTerrace Luxembourg\u201d / or light drapery figures\u2014Of course the stone itself would be the thing\u2014and I must send one over soon\u2014only then all out of door work must be on paper\u2014\n\nThis last kind would I should think be very safe for travelling and enduring\u2014I mean for instance\u2014supposing I were to go to Venice (dont say anything about this to any one) I might produce a series of wonderful things that would bring results of all kinds!\n\n\u2014But the question of paper ought to be solved first\u2014For how could I take a matter of twenty stones!\u2014and if that were possible how could I safely send them over to you as they went on!?\u2014\n\nMany thanks for your letter\u2014and with  \nkindest messages  \nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \n[21 August 1894]\n\nA line to tell you how delighted I am with your letter and the pleasure you express at this new result! However I have still another paper\u2014This is in the nature of the transparent one that failed through inferiority and cheapness!\u2014It is simply wonderful to draw upon\u2014Giving the most really \u201cvelvety\u201d effects\u2014The only danger is in the journey! You might have the stones with fine grain ready so that the drawings could be popped on in all freshness. Probably by tomorrows post a couple\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac\u2014Paris.  \n[22 August 1894]\n\nMy dear Way\u2014The proofs are lovely!\u2014The lady seated in the hat and feathers that I shall call for the present \u201cThe Visit\u201d [cat. 99], is really splendid! in its go and brightness!\u2014dont you think? and certainly the paper in your hands has done wonderfully\u2014\n\nAlso the garden one is very very pretty\u2014I shall call that \u201cThe Sisters\u201d [cat. 100] [fig. 1] for the moment\u2014\n\nAnd now the other seated lady [cat. 98] you know I like. / The paper was cheap and faulty\u2014but there is a quality about the chalk on it that is simply beautiful!\u2014It looks like a charcoal drawing\u2014Now I am sending you a \u201cForge du Passage du Dragon\u201d on this kind of paper, but of a far superior condition\u2014I am ordering some more of it\u2014and I think that this ought to give us wonderful results\u2014with absolutely the \u201cvelvet\u201d I am always trying for!\n\nOf course I shall be most anxious to know what you think of all this\u2014I suppose that I shall use these two kinds of papers for different purposes, the first for light bright portraits etc . . . and the second for lamp effects and deep interiors etc\u2014 /\n\nIt is very nice of you to devote yourself to these proofs so entirely\u2014and I am enchanted\u2014But also I think that we are on the verge of things that have scarcely ever been done!\u2014\n\nBesides I fancy I am beginning to draw a bit! What do you think?\n\nI scratch this off in great haste and shall write again directly and also send you more paper immediately\u2014\n\nI would go on printing off the 25 each\u2014and dont forget the little Rue Furstenburg\u2014Defective though the paper be you have made / it come out charmingly and it is a pretty little drawing\u2014Dont you like the little horse?\u2014and the figures?\u2014\n\nAlways yours  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n21 Wellington St.  \nStrand. [London]  \nAugt. 23. 1894\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAm glad to hear that you were pleased with the proofs, so were we. Kindly send more paper that we may print the last 3. have only 4 sheets here.\n\nYours faithfully  \nH. E. Morgan.\n\n110 Rue du Bac [Paris]  \n[28 August 1894]\n\nDear Mr. Way,\n\nI have sent you today, 100 sheets of paper. Mr. Whistler says will you print him all the new ones, also\u2014the nude model reading [cat. 33]\u2014the seated figure in a fur cape [cat. 17]\u2014The winged hat\u2014the Mosquetaire [cat. 35]\u2014and the dancing girl [cat. 29] / and some of the draped figure with the book [cat. 32].\n\nIf you could send some of the 3 Luxembourgs [cat. 68, cat. 69, and cat. 70] as soon as possible, he will be much obliged\u2014\n\nWith kind regards to your father  \nVery Sincerely  \nBeatrix Whistler\n\n110 Rue du Bac [Paris]  \n[28 August 1894]\n\nDear Mr. Way,\n\nI am sending you some new paper by this post. Mr. Whistler is looking forward to seeing the new proofs\u2014He says:\u2014if you send the mildewed paper back\u2014he / will perhaps be able to take the marks out, as he has just heard of a way of removing them.\n\nWith our kindest regards.  \nVery Sincerely  \nBeatrix Whistler\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Augt. 28th 1894\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler,\n\nI am sending this evening proofs of the 2 drawings received yesterday. They will, I hope, give you satisfaction but you will not forget that the process is to me a novelty looking for some considerable study and experience on my part to develop. That they promise as much as I said in my last note is still my opinion, if I can carry the printing to anything approaching the perfection of your drawings. / The proofs I am having pulled upon the \u201cnew Dutch\u201d that you may judge whether I have been too severe about the mildew.\n\nThe Studio order is printed and ready for delivery but we are still waiting to hear from Mr. Thomson.\n\nWith kindest regards \u2013  \nYours faithfully,  \nT. Way\n\nParis, 110 Rue du Bac, Aug. 29, 1894.\n\nI am enchanted! You are \u2018developing\u2019 the matter most delightfully\u2014and I seem to be on the way to realizing soon the \u2018quality\u2019 that I all along felt my work ought to give\u2014if we could master the material.\n\nThe proofs look like beautiful \u2018drawings\u2019\u2014This last one of the lady in the garden (which we will call \u2018La Belle Gardini\u00e8re\u2019) is really lovely! . . .\n\nNow at last I am sending you a drawing on the other kind of paper, from which I hope \u2018so much\u2019!!! . . . It should give \u2018absolutely perfect\u2019 results.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac [Paris]  \n[30 August 1894]\n\nDear Mr. Way:\n\nMr. Whistler has sent by this post, another drawing\u2014\u201cThe Priest\u2019s House\u201d, [cat. 105] and 50 sheets of paper.\n\nWill you; he says, go on with the sets, with the exception of the Duette [cat. 104]\u2014which / he wishes you to hold over until he sees you, when he will explain what he wants.\n\nWith our kindest regards\u2014  \nBelieve me.  \nVery Sincerely Yours  \nBeatrix Whistler\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. Paris.  \nSunday\u2014[2 September 1894]\n\nMy dear Way\u2014I do hope you have my little Forge all right by this time\u2014and I have every belief in your making it turn out as I long to see it!\u2014\n\nNow I send you tonight one on your favorite paper\u2014for my new paper had not as yet been made\u2014\n\nThis new drawing we will call for the present the \u201cSmithy of the Passage\u201d\u2014\n\nThe last drawing of the \u201cPriests house Rouen\u201d, / of which I received the proofs this morning, is, as far as you are concerned, excellent, but as for me, I think but slightly of it\u2014It is really not up to the mark\u2014and for the moment we will put it aside\u2014Don\u2019t print any more of it until our lunch at Simpsons!\u2014\n\nBut the others we can go on with\u2014the sets of 25\u2014I do want them!\u2014This paper (Dutch) I am sending you lately is simply the most beautiful possible\u2014and the proofs upon it will be lovely\u2014\n\nDont you like the seated figure? I call it \u201cThe Lady Paresseuse\u201d [cat. 98]\u2014 /\n\nThe one in the garden is \u201cLa belle Jardini\u00e8re\u201d tell Tom\u2014for his Catalogue\u2014The two in the garden \u201cthe Sisters\u201d, I call now \u201cConfidences in the Garden\u201d. The little \u201cRue de Furstenberg\u201d mind is a great favorite of mine.\u2014\n\nI have a whole lot half finished that will be coming directly\u2014And now I have just received the new paper! So do solve that problem\u2014and then everything will begin! for as yet I have done nothing to compare to what will come if we master the material\u2014And I have great plans\u2014and one of them you will be delighted / with, when you hear it\u2014for it concerns London!\u2014However for the moment mystery is the order of the day\u2014to be followed by wealth\u2014and a new era in lithography!\n\nwith kindest messages to all\n\nAlways  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nDo write a line to say it is all right.\n\n[Paris]  \n5 September 1894\n\nIt takes the chalk in a most fascinating way, and produces all the effects of stump without using the stumps at all. . . .\n\nI feel that with this paper if perfect, I could do wonders. What do you say? You see the drawings themselves are getting better. Well I must wait and see.\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac. [Paris]  \n[13 September 1894]\n\nHave been kept from everything by bad cold\u2014That\u2019s the reason\u2014will write tomorrow\u2014\n\nIt will all be right\u2014and we shall be delighted with everything\u2014except, by the way the Duet [cat. 104]!\u2014of which you may print two proofs only\u2014on the Japanese paper\u2014to show what you consider the best condition\u2014and then I will decide.\n\nFor me the very finest qualities, are in \u201cLa Belle Dame Paresseuse\u201d\u2014more tomorrow\u2014\n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nDelighted about the Rue Furstenberg and hope you will send the Belle Jardini\u00e8re some time. Mix the papers, for my part I really prefer the beautiful old Dutch\u2014Sending you new drawings. Disappointed with Forges\u2014but still\u2014!! Wait\u2014\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac\u2014Paris.  \n[14 September 1894]\n\nMy dear Way\u2014You see this rubbishy cold of mine and the present blowy weather have just prevented my finishing one or two out of door things that ought to be excellent\u2014and that would help to show where we are with the new paper\u2014Mind you, the two forges [cat. 102 and cat. 103] are disappointments to us now\u2014but you must remember that we have been making amazing progress! and some time ago, I daresay we should have thought, with a certain pleasant astonishment, that we were doing very wonderful things indeed had we produced these two failures then! Now let us distinguish\u2014The two proofs are on two different papers. The failure is really I believe more my fault, than yours\u2014Take the stump / fellow\u2014My work here was not sharp enough and bright enough\u2014It was too much nagged at\u2014you like the paper\u2014and I rather wore it out! Look at \u201cLa Belle Jardini\u00e8re\u201d\u2014There the result is excellent\u2014not too much stump\u2014The perfection in employment of that paper is seen in \u201cLa Jolie New Yorkaise Louis Quinze\u201d (The Visit, old title)\u2014That is a fine drawing, short and sharp\u2014as it ought to be\u2014Now what I am aiming at in the deep effects ought to be brought about on the other paper, which you think as yet not so well made. Well\u2014but I am in hopes that it can be pre-pared with greater care\u2014The principle seems to me as I draw upon it to be right\u2014and we must yet try the newer stuff I have just got\u2014Though I am not sure that Lemercier has done even this as well as he may be made to\u2014The second little Forge was an old bit, and even it had some beautiful results\u2014All the simple lines were of a charming quality\u2014shutters\u2014top windows, etc\u2014much prettier than in the other\u2014and devoid of any of the grittiness of the usual \u201clithograph\u201d\u2014Well the next time all the rest shall be more certain\u2014and if put on the stone at once, I think we will find that we have made an / immense stride\u2014or if again failure then I must see Lemercier about the gum on the paper being better in strength\u2014and more carefully spread. Certainly I mean that the newest and most beautiful quality I have reached, is in \u201cla Belle dame Paresseuse\u201d, and that was on a paper of the same kind, though I fancied of an inferior condition\u2014Take a fine proof of this and put beside it any one of the old lithographs out of your portfolio\u2014and then see how this \u2018belle dame\u2019 looks fair and silvery, and beautiful in the quality of blacks! Indeed far away more like the charcoal drawing itself of the painter\u2014than anything that had ever been printed!\u2014It is really also quite velvety\u2014like, in / effect, the burr in a dry point!\u2014Now even the little Rue de Furstenberg has also this same \u201cfusain\u201d look\u2014and no other paper has ever given it!\u2014\n\nIf I can only get that paper put quite right, then we can do anything\u2014and this is something, worth while\u2014for \u201cLithography\u201d shall develop into very strange matter indeed\u2014and the fun and the mystery will begin in earnest!\n\nWait, till I get some more nude figures too! besides\u2014well never mind just yet\u2014\n\nI suppose you will be sending me the \u201cFurstenburg\u201d, and the \u201cBelle Jardini\u00e8re\u201d and whatever else there is\u2014\n\nThe \u201cDuet\u201d [cat. 104] as I said, I dont think so highly of\u2014but you might and see what you think is its best\u2014and send a couple of proofs to judge of\u2014The single figure Forge [cat. 103] you might perhaps have one more trial at\u2014but the other [cat. 102] I would leave for the present\u2014 / That is all for today!!\n\nWith best regards to both  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\.

A word or two may be said about them\u2014perhaps\u2014in the famous Catalogue\u2014of that when we lunch together / at Simpson\u2019s\u2014\n\nWell the proofs came all right this morning\u2014and very lovely they are\u2014Really La belle Jardini\u00e8re is delightful\u2014and the Forge [cat. 102] has a fine and dignified appearance\u2014what a pity that the top window came out so weak\u2014I have half a mind to scrape that out altogether\u2014however we will see\u2014Now I count very much on the new one I sent yesterday\u2014Let us get it on to the stone at once, even though the printer has gone away.\u2014The Rue de Furstenburg is lovely!\u2014But the \u201cDuet\u201d wont do\u2014I know all about the Rembrandt effect\u2014but the heads are unworthy. I did not then know my material, and couldn\u2019t see what I was doing. I shall do another of the same subject\u2014meanwhile dont show\u2014 /\n\nDid you see the ridiculous paragraph in last weeks Illustrated London News\u2014Now that you are an authority you shall write and say that these works are in no way like Mr. Thingamy\u2019s \u201cdrawing book\u201d of the early Victorian period\u2014It also is not true that there is going to be a \u201cshow\u201d at Goupils\u2014About this also by and bye\u2014I have other ideas!!\n\nWith many messages Always  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\.

I would get them on the stones at once in all their freshness\u2014They were done last night\u2014I rely on their simplicity for their success. I send also some more paper\u2014very lovely old Dutch and I think just a pretty size\u2014we will call No. 1. \u201cLa Robe Rouge\u201d\u2014I rather want to see how the colour is conveyed!\u2014\u201cyou\u201d will think me quite crazy!\u2014No. 2. \u201cLa Dormeuse\u201d.

Whereas in this newest paper that I have had made there is deuced little difference and great difficulty in making it out!\u2014All these things must be quite cleared up. I do hope these last drawings will turn out all right and that you will both feel how nice it is to deal, in your part, with this material, for it is charming to draw upon\u2014for me!\n\nWell about limiting the number\u2014We will talk about that\u2014I intend to bring up the value of these proofs in lithography\u2014You see already I am giving to them the same beautiful and rare papers that I use for the etchings\u2014And this old notion of \u2018popularity\u2019 is all nonsense\u2014I find that only the same old clientelle who collect the etchings, buy the lithographs\u2014and I am not going to give old Dutch paper and Japanese away for nothing\u2014neither am I going to have the proofs on any thing inferior. That last small / Dutch is lovely, and the two drawings ought [to] go charmingly upon it\u2014\n\nAs to the exhibition\u2014yes it is to be under entirely new conditions and in a new place\u2014but of that by and bye\u2014at lunch at Simpsons!\u2014\n\nIf this paper, or another specially made, like it can be settled upon\u2014then we will go into the coloured work!!\u2014and we will wipe up the place! But let us keep that dark at present!\u2014\n\nAs to the periodicals\u2014I don\u2019t mean that to be the real object\u2014We are altogether too choice for that!\u2014Only now and again will we give them something\u2014just to make them eager\u2014And by the way I shall doubtless arrange for you to print one for the \u201cGazette des Beaux Arts\u201d\u2014They have been at me\u2014and I see in it a certain reason that would make / it worth while, and have made your printing a condition\u2014\n\nNow I must be off\u2014  \nWith best messages  \nVery sincerely yours  \nJ. McN Whistler.\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Septr. 25th 1894\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler,\n\nI am sending by Post this evening proofs of the last 3 drawings [cat. 106, cat. 107, and cat. 108] which I hope will meet your wishes.\n\nFrom a lithographer\u2019s point of view they are hardly perfection, suffering as they do in many places from Flaws in material which might have been avoided. But to you, of course, they will appeal from quite a different standpoint and I hope may encourage you to further endeavours\u2014\n\nOf course I cannot but enter my / protest against this flimsy paper.\n\nIt seems amazing that with so perfect a material as that used by you for the drawing of the \u201cBelle Jardini\u00e8re\u201d you should choose one which must give you infinitely more trouble in the execution and be much less satisfactory in the result. But all this I have said in ink before and you do\u2019n\u2019t believe it, so, until we can meet and talk it out\u2014good bye!\n\nWith kindest remembrances from us all to Mrs. W. and yourself\n\nYours faithfully  \nT. Way\n\n[Paris, 26 September 1894]\n\nBut I am charmed, my dear Way with the quality of these last three drawings!\n\nSurely you must feel with me that there is something about the proofs that is more fascinating than what we obtained from the other paper. In the first place they are much more like absolute drawings on the stone itself direct. . . .\n\nNow the two proofs of the \u2018Dormeuse\u2019 are really delightful. Here you can scarcely complain of blemishes in the paper. Do you? and the \u2018Robe Rouge.\u2019 Compare these with the La New Yorkaise which I was so pleased with. Is there not a colour and a sweetness about these last more sympathetic than what the other yields? . . .\n\nThere is something hard and ungracious about the thicker paper, and only the most dexterous and smart works leaves us with pleasant results. For instance the \u2018Forge of the Passage du Dragon\u2019 gives very poor results for the amount of work put into it . . . .\n\nTake again the \u2018Priests House Rouen,\u2019 as I drew I hoped for a beautiful picture. Well it is a dull mealy tiresome thing, and by the way the time has come to do away with that drawing. Please destroy it at once. . . .\n\nYou see I am sacrificing etchings and all for these lithographs! a real triumph for you.  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\. Rue du Bac.

Of the \u201cFruiti\u00e8re de la Rue de Grenelle\u201d say 30 (in all.) and let them be full and rich!\u2014\n\nAs to this last, of the two ladies, I want only three more printed now, as this stone also I can touch when I turn up among you!\u2014  \n\n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\.

I certainly thought I had presented your Father with one\u2014but I will now\u2014You have never seen it then?\u2014It is very beautiful\u2014and as a portrait of the poet extraordinary\u2014\n\nWhat I want you to do now is to pull me half a dozen proofs of the \u201cB\u00e9b\u00e9s du Luxembourg\u201d\u2014giving all the richness that the stone is capable of\u2014This drawing by the way was done on / the old Austrian stuff!\u2014Pull the proofs for me on the old Dutch.\u2014and do Tom let me have them directly if you can\u2014\n\nMr. Thomson passed through on Friday\u2014on his way to London\u2014I told him that I had a great mind not to let the Virtue people have that, or anything else!\u2014 I suppose he will see you directly\u2014Of course the printing will be under precisely the same conditions as before.\u2014\n\nThe last proofs you sent are beautiful! Surely your Father must feel that the \u201cFruiti\u00e8re de la Rue de Grenelle\u201d\u2014is more beautiful in quality as lithograph than what we obtained before! and as to the sleeping lady [cat. 108], he ought to like it beyond any lithograph I have done!\u2014I do!\u2014\n\nSoon I hope to send you some more draped figures\u2014and other drawing\u2014but I am awfully busy\u2014You must both go to the New Gallery\u2014and see my portrait of Mrs. Sickert\u2014 I have told them to send you Private View tickets\u2014\n\nWith kindest messages  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\n110\\.

I sent you some prints awhile since, and hope you liked them, I have now sent proofs of the drawing you were making from the office window, we kept it hoping you might return after the trial but finding that you did not do so and / being anxious that it should not be destroyed, we proved it. Father is very enthusiastic, I like it very much too, what do you say? My medical man, a Dr. Boyd Joll has become a great admirer of your lithographs and as he is coming over to see the Salon, has asked me to give him an introduction to you. Thinking that he may become a purchaser I have given him my card, but in case you do not care to be bothered with him, I have told him how ill Mrs. Whistler is and consequently he will hardly expect to see you, still I believe him to be a man of means, and he was Leylands Liverpool doctor and is now the same to his son\u2014 / have you heard of the exhibition of Lithography in August in Paris to commemorate its centenary? and shall you contribute? with kindest regards to Mrs. Whistler and yourself\n\nI remain  \nYours very Sincerely  \nTom R. Way  \n[fig. 2]\n\n21 Wellington St.  \nLondon, WC.  \nJuly 15. 1895\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler\n\nIt is a long time since we have heard from you\u2014though indirectly I have heard how busy you have been with portraits, and through Mr. Keppel of New York I have heard about the lithograph of Lady Haden hence I suppose you are pleased with it. I must thank you exceedingly for the kind way you treated Dr. Joll, and he / has fully appreciated his interview. C. H. Shannon being made art editor of a new publication and being anxious to have a lithograph, came and saw me on the subject, in order that as time is very short (the whole book must be printed early in August) he might ask you for the use of one that you had already done\u2014I shewed him such as I thought suitable for the size of his page and he tells me that he has asked for the Horoscope and the portrait of your brother\u2014Since writing the above he has been here and tells me you have given him permission to use the latter. Are we to pull / the 3000 impressions for him as we have for the others? (the Studio etc.) you might send us a postcard with instructions please. Also he was not quite certain as to its title. Is it to be \u201cDr. Whistler\u201d or \u201cportrait of my brother\u201d or \u201cThe Doctor\u201d? as he fancies you intend by your letter. I trust Mrs. Whistler is better, and that you are well and with kindest regards from my father and self to both\n\nremain\n\nYours very Sincerely  \nTom. R.

But we must hope that all this will change soon for the better\u2014\n\nWe are not yet well\u2014and of course I was greatly behindhand with much work that is even yet not quite finished. / In the mean time however here is this matter of the new magazine\u2014\n\nWell, as I told Mr. Shannon, you can print for him an edition, for his paper, of \u201cThe Doctor\u201d [cat. 110]\u2014under exactly the same conditions as heretofore with the Studio and the others\u2014Making a transfer of course and keeping the original stone untouched for my proofs\u2014\n\nI cannot at present write as I would do, if I were not still greatly preoccupied\u2014 / But say many nice things to your Father for me\u2014Among them however tell him I do not share his approval of any of the work I did this last time in England!\u2014and wish every trace of that sad visit removed\u2014\n\nIt was mad to think that, under the circumstances, I should be able to do anything\u2014Wherefore wipe out at once the Ly. Haden [cat. 116]\u2014The view out of the window in Wellington Street [cat. 117]\u2014and whatever else I had the folly to think I was doing when really all my thoughts were elsewhere\u2014Show none of these things to anyone\u2014And now how can Mr. Keppel / have known anything about this, absurd drawing of the Ly. Haden when I have only had the two proofs you sent me and have never shown them to a soul!

The prints of yours which we have sent are the following, 1. Limehouse 2. Nocturne 3. Old Battersea Bridge (the tall drawing made for Piccadilly) [cat. 12] 4. the Toilet (drawn for the same) 5. The little nude model reading / 6. the Doctor [cat. 110], this we put in the place of \u201cthe winged hat\u201d which we had framed. My father had selected this set as shewing the greatest variety from a technical point of view. If there had been time I would have included the others. I have requested that your lithographs be hung together in a group. I trust you will forgive me for not being able to get all you wished sent, but it was impossible.

Lyme Regis [Dorset]  \n[27 September 1895]\n\nMy dear Tom\u2014You seem to me to be all of you in a very distraught state\u2014and to need very much a few short clear utterances from my long absent self!\u2014\n\nIn the first place I can see that you [are] all disturbed about nothing at all\u2014in the shape of Goulding!!!\u2014What can it matter what he does?\u2014He never in his life can print as your / Father and you do\u2014and as to his \u201cnames\u201d\u2014and sketches on paper!\u2014if I were to tell you a story concerning a certain fan, that I can and will tell you, you both would only be too amused at the inevitable upshot of all this plotting in Soho!\u2014\n\nThe trouble is that you are in too great a flurry\u2014and then you are so fastened to your old fancies\u2014We could win all along the line in an exhibition perhaps\u2014but the idea of sending to Paris! such very early primitive and poor attempts as \u201cLimehouse\u201d!\u2014 and the Old Battersea Bridge!!! [cat. 12]\u2014The Nocturne too is certainly not the thing that should represent me now\u2014The Doctor in / short is the only thing that out of that lot ought to have gone, excepting always the model reading [cat. 33]\u2014And what a nice little group you might have got together!\u2014I dont know at this moment what the \u201cToilet\u201d is\u2014but with the \u201cDoctor\u201d, there might have been The Blanchiseuse, and the Fruiti\u00e8re\u2014and La Belle Dame endormie, and the Belle New Yorkaise\u2014Two or three of the draped and dancing figures\u2014The Confidences in the Garden\u2014and in short. . . . Well there again you are all wrong in your notion of the sense of things in France\u2014In London they know absolutely nothing! nothing! nothing!\u2014I am especially thinking of those who go to make an Exhibition, or who take an interest in the things shown\u2014Whereas in Paris there is a great habit of technique\u2014if only that\u2014And absolutely childish things could not appear without the ridicule they merit\u2014Of this more by and bye\u2014only I mean that it is always worth while being / well represented over there\u2014And if such things as I have seen (was it in the \u201cStudio\u201d?\u2014where was it?) by Burlington House people were to be shown, there would be a howl of derisive laughter! Wherefore you had better just pray that Goulding do succeed in getting together a large group of his famous persons\u2014and that an exhibition be made, with much booming and hurrahing, of their precious works\n\n\u2014 This if you wish the atmosphere to be cleared!\n\nI am sending today package of seven drawings\u2014Do get them on stone directly\u2014One, a light and rather dainty one of children in a doorway [cat. 119] ought perhaps to be rushed on first\u2014as it was a damp evening\u2014and I fear the chalk might soon be affected\u2014Mr. Pennell tells me he has left a book of old paper with you as well as the Dutch of mine you already have\u2014This French paper we bought together\u2014It is very beautiful\u2014 / You have printed many fine proofs on the same kind for me\u2014I do hope you will get a lot of colour out of these new drawings\u2014They are very simple\u2014and I hope your Father will like them!\u2014\n\nWrite me a line tomorrow to say you have received them all right\u2014  \n\nWith kindest regards to your father.  \n[signed with a butterfly]\n\nLITHOGRAPHIC PRINTING OFFICE  \n21, WELLINGTON STREET, STRAND, W.C.  \nLONDON, Sep 28 1895\n\nMy dear Mr. Whistler\n\nJust a line to thank you for your letter, and to say that the drawings have arrived safely.

This corrects his mistaken statement that Whistler had abandoned the \u201cold-fashioned grained transfer paper\u201d about two years before the drawing of Count Robert de Montesquiou (cat. 85), executed in July 1894; Way (1912), p. 106. This lithograph is exceptional in that Whistler used a coarser grain of papier viennois that he had virtually abandoned by 1891 in favor of the finest grain of the same paper; Smale (1984), pp. 78\u201379.

Almost all of the succeeding letters for August and September refer to transfer papers. Whistler seems to have used several different samples of the thin, textureless, transparent transfer paper known as papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, all of which he obtained from Lemercier. On the first sample he drew four subjects (cat. 95 and cat. 96; dwg. X and dwg. XI); see letter 107 and letter 109. This paper Whistler considered to be \u201cvery poorly and unequally prepared\u201d; letter 107. Another specimen of this kind of paper (but of a superior quality) was used for cat. 97, cat. 98, and cat. 102 (cat. 102 was drawn on the \u201clast bit\u201d and the \u201cold bit\u201d mentioned in letter 107 and letter 118, respectively). In September Lemercier supplied Whistler with samples of this type of transfer paper, prepared especially for him, and on these he drew La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle (cat. 106), La Robe rouge (cat. 107), La Belle Dame endormie (cat. 108), and The Sisters (cat. 109); see letter 119, letter 121, and letter 125. Whistler found another specimen of transfer paper at Lemercier\u2019s workshop that he described as being mounted on a backing sheet; letter 107; on this paper he drew cat. 99, cat. 100, cat. 101, cat. 103, and cat. 105, and dwg. XIII and dwg. XIV; see letter 116, letter 118, and letter 123. Thomas Way liked this paper and disliked the flimsy unmounted papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal; letter 123.\n\nFGA 137a.

DU BAC / 7E / 14 / AOUT / 94 and LONDON / W.C. / S.M.P. / BA / AU / 15 / 94\n\nWhistler had used \u201ca French paper of something of the same kind\u201d in 1892, but had not informed Way how it should be transferred; see letter 33 n. 114. T. R. Way wrote of the new transfer paper Whistler used for the Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97): \u201cIt was very thin and transparent, with a surface like glass. It is made for the purpose of writing facsimiles of letters, being pinned over the original and the writing traced through with ink and a pen. As it has no \u2018tooth\u2019 upon its surface at all, the greasy lithographic chalk slides over, leaving only a faint stain apparent, but its transferring qualities are very perfect, and the slightest grease will come off on to the stone and print\u201d; Way (1912), pp. 107\u201308.\n\nWhistler\u2019s preliminary drawing on the French transfer paper, called papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, would most likely have been transferred by E. Duch\u00e2tel, the premier artistic printer for Lemercier. Whistler had discussed technical matters with Duch\u00e2tel at Lemercier\u2019s workshop around November 1892, when he was working on his portraits of St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 (cat. 59 and cat. 60); Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, pp. 134\u201335; see letter 38 n. 103. Duch\u00e2tel printed lithographs for Fantin-Latour, who had employed papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal since the 1870s and had recommended it to Whistler in 1892; see letter 33 n. 114.\n\n[glossary:Count Robert de Montesquiou] (cat. 85); see letter 92 n. 177.\n\nLCPC box 3.

Way wrote: \u201cThere is another side which will be apparent to students, a certain softness of quality, almost at times a blurred effect, as though the drawing had been made with a stump. The Mallarm\u00e9 portrait has it, and most of the subjects done at Lyme Regis of forges\u201d; Way (1912), p. 108.\n\nThe transferring of drawings from papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal to a grained stone and their subsequent proofing was new to Thomas Way at this point, and he needed time to try out the new materials and assess the results; letter 113. Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97) had been sent to him on August 14 (letter 104) and Way\u2019s missing reply had probably reached Whistler on August 17, meaning Thomas Way had very little time to evaluate the new paper and be more definite about its potential. However, his missing letter to Whistler was no doubt encouraging, though perhaps cautious, about the matter of retransferring such images to stone and printing large editions; see letter 113. Such problems were later overcome when La Robe rouge (cat. 107), a drawing on this kind of paper especially prepared by Lemercier, was successfully published in The Studio 6, no. 32 (November 1895).\n\nSimpson\u2019s, Limited, a hotel and restaurant at 101\u201303 Strand, London, W.C.\n\nLa Belle Dame paresseuse (cat. 98).\n\nFrom a photocopy. Original in the collection of Walter and Nesta Spink, Ann Arbor, Michigan. Folded sheet, written on all sides. Dated in pencil, in another hand, on first side, 19 Aug. 1894.\n\nThe appearance and quality of the papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal Whistler used in 1894 may be seen from a few surviving samples that have untransferred drawings upon them. Two of these subjects, Seated Woman in Luxembourg Gardens (dwg. X) and Statue, Luxembourg Gardens (dwg. XI), indicate that Whistler returned to the Luxembourg Gardens to try out the new paper on subjects he had drawn earlier using the German grained paper. A third sample, with the drawing Beatrix Whistler Looking at Her Birds (dwg. XII), also dates from 1894 and may be compared to cat. 101 and cat. 102. These transfer papers are very delicate and transparent, and are treated on the drawn side with a thin layer of composition that is still sticky to the touch. They appear to be identical to transfer paper found in sample books and described as \u201cFrench transfer paper,\u201d available in England in the early 1900s; see sample books, St. Bride Printing Library, London.\n\nThe method mentioned by Whistler of attaching the transfer paper to a backing sheet had the added advantage of preventing the very thin paper from curling when being laid upon the stone.\n\nLemercier no. 3 was a softer grade of crayon; see letter 43 n. 162.\n\nSee letter 54 n. 24.\n\nLCPC box 3.

The new drawing on the same kind of paper was The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102); see letter 109. T. R. Way recorded that Whistler was very enthusiastic about both these subjects: \u201cCertainly one can feel in all the subjects drawn upon this paper that the chalk has passed over the surface exactly as his mind has directed it, without any effort being necessary to overcome the resistance due even to a granulated surface. But he did not get any of this material ready-made, at least none of a kind on which he could rely, and he had to have some specially prepared for him by Lemerciers in Paris\u201d; Way (1912), p. 109; see letter 103 n. 12.\n\nLCPC box 3.

The \u201clamp effects and deep interiors\u201d referred to his latest drawing, The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102), for which he had used a superior quality of transfer paper to that on which he had drawn Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97) and La Belle Dame paresseuse (cat. 98). Unlike these last subjects, The Forge contained dark areas of tonal work.\n\nGUL M455. Post card\n\nAddressed: J. A. McN.

Whistler had received a proof of this subject (originally called The Visit) on August 22, and it seems very likely that he had used for it the transfer paper mentioned in his letter to Way as \u201canother specimen\u201d of Lemercier\u2019s that could be transferred with great certainty, which Way had received about August 20; see letter 107, letter 109, and letter 103 n. 12.\n\nThe Smith, Passage du Dragon (cat. 103).

These were probably Figure Study (cat. 113) and Study (cat. 114); see letter 126 and letter 130. Whistler may also have been referring to proofs of these subjects in letter 131.\n\nLCPC box 3.

However, his comment that it was a failure \u201cowing to my work\u2014which had lost part of its freshness\u2014and was too fatigued,\u201d suggests some doubt; for it corresponds in some measure with a similar passage in letter 118, in which the artist refers to his work on transfer paper in connection with The Smith, Passage du Dragon (cat. 103), as being \u201ctoo much nagged at . . . and I rather wore it out!\u201d There remains therefore some uncertainty in letter 119 as to which of the two forge subjects Whistler was referring to.\n\nFGA 138.

Way and William Rothenstein were closely associated at this time. Whistler had initially advised Rothenstein to go to Thomas Way to make lithographs for the folio of portraits entitled Oxford Characters (London, 1896). T. R. Way had published an article on Whistler\u2019s lithographs with Rothenstein in The Studio in April 1894; Rothenstein and Way (1894).\n\nWhistler\u2019s reference here to \u201cthe Forge\u201d suggests The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102), but his accompanying description of the subject as being of \u201ca fine and dignified appearance\u201d and to the \u201ctop window\u201d as being \u201cso weak,\u201d clearly identifies it as The Smith, Passage du Dragon (cat. 103). The Forge, Passage du Dragon, on the other hand, is noted by Whistler for the charming quality of its windows and shutters; see letter 118.\n\nThe printer may have been H. P. Bray ; see letter 87 n. 156.\n\nThe Duet (cat. 104). Unlike Whistler, T. R. Way particularly liked this print; Way (1912), p. 109.\n\nThe notice in the Illustrated London News questioned whether the art of lithography was quite worthy of Whistler\u2019s skill, which was so comprehensively expressed through his work as an etcher. It continued: \u201cNot that the lithographs are much less terse or expressive. But the public, and even connoisseurs\u2019, taste has to be educated greatly before it can divest itself of association between lithographs and Vere Foster\u2019s drawing-books of a generation ago.\u201d Some of Whistler\u2019s most recent lithographs were mentioned by name and it was reported that his lithographs were to be shown at the Goupil Gallery; \u201cArt Notes,\u201d Illustrated London News, 15 September 1894, p. 352. Brown had proposed showing a group of Whistler\u2019s lithographs at the Fine Art Society, but Whistler declined; Brown to Whistler, 30 August 1894, GUL F213; Whistler to Brown, Monday [3 September 1894], GUL F214. Whistler also wrote to Huish regarding the piece in the Illustrated London News, saying that he did not want any publicity yet and wanted to sell his etchings and lithographs quietly for the moment; Whistler to Huish, Sunday [September 1894], GUL LB3/10. Before the end of the month, however, Whistler seems to have negotiated new conditions for an exhibition, probably with Huish at the FAS, where a retrospective of his lithographs opened in December 1895; letter 122.\n\nGUL W1411.

In 1898 Andr\u00e9 Mellerio wrote that lithography enabled the artist \u201cto put for very modest prices true works of art within the reach of ever larger groups of people. That is, we think, all that can and should be done in our desire to further purify public taste\u201d; Andr\u00e9 Mellerio, La lithographie originale en couleurs (Paris, 1898), quoted in P. D. Cate and S. H. Hitchings, The Color Revolution\u2014Color Lithography in France, 1890\u20131900, exh. cat. (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Art Gallery, 1978), p. 95. Whistler was under pressure from dealers to keep his prices down. Thomson, Edward Kennedy, Huish, and [glossary:Brown] all objected when he raised the prices of his lithographs; see Whistler\u2019s correspondence with these individuals dating from August and September of 1894 in GUL; see also Kennedy to Whistler, 12 April 1893, GUL W1202; Whistler to Kennedy, [April 1896], NYPL II/84; and Whistler\u2019s records of lithographs sent to the Fine Art Society, John P. Heseltine, Boussod, Valadon, and Co., Hermann Wunderlich and Co., and Charles Lang Freer; GUL NB1/10, 58, 60, 86, 92. See also \u201cMarketing the Lithographs. Whistler made his attitude clear when he was interviewed in the late summer of 1894 in Paris. He was reported in The Studio as saying: \u201cArt is the worst aristocrat of all, it has nothing to do with the masses\u201d; see \u201cAfternoons in Studios: A Chat with Mr. Whistler,\u201d The Studio 4, no. 22 (January 1895), p. 118.\n\nSee letter 120 n. 64.\n\nWork on the color lithographs for the \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d had not advanced since Whistler\u2019s quarrel with Belfond in 1893. In 1894 the print shop closed down and Whistler\u2019s stones vanished; Pennell and Pennell (1908), vol. 2, p. 159; letter 127. It seems likely that Whistler hoped to work with Way in color (he had executed his first color lithograph, Figure Study in Colors [cat. 39] with Way in 1890), but unfortunately his work in this field was never developed beyond the trial proofs printed with Belfond (cat. 45, cat. 46, cat. 55, cat. 56, cat. 66, and cat. 67); see also letter 128.\n\nWhistler considered his previous attempts to produce lithographs (cat. 84 and cat. 85) for the Gazette des beaux-arts to be failures, and he never in fact published a lithograph in the French journal.\n\nGUL W114. Single sheet, printed heading, written on two sides.\n\nSee letter 103 n. 12, letter 114, and letter 116 n. 44.\n\nGUL PC21/74. Copy of a partially transcribed letter, from a detached page of an unidentified and undated English dealers catalogue in a volume of press cuttings at GUL. The catalogue entry describes the letter as follows: \u201cA very lengthy A. L. S. (Butterfly) to Mr. Thomas Way, his lithographic printer. 4 closely written pages. Oblong 8 vo. Paris, 25th September, 1894. With envelope. \u00a322 10s. Of exceedingly great interest, expressing his satisfaction of the proofs of some lithographs, but condemning the \u2018Priests House Rouen\u2019 and giving instructions for the destruction of the drawing: further stating he was sacrificing etchings for the sake of these lithographs.\u201d\n\nThe date ascribed in the dealer\u2019s catalogue, 25 September 1894, appears to be incorrect. The lithographs referred to by Whistler in this letter were transferred, proved, and posted to the artist by Thomas Way on 25 September 1894 (see letter 123 and app. II.3 and app. II.4, entries for 25 September 1894).

According to Sickert, Whistler was working on several self-portraits in June 1895, one of which was probably Brown and Gold (YMSM 440); see Young et al. (1980), p. 195, no. 440.\n\nThe Pageant (1896\u201397) was jointly edited by Charles Hazelwood Shannon and Gleeson White.\n\nThe Horoscope (cat. 30) and The Doctor (cat. 110). Whistler suggested changing the title of the latter to Doctor Whistle\u2014Portrait of my Brother; letter 138. The publication of The Pageant was delayed until the following year, and Whistler\u2019s lithograph appeared in the magazine\u2019s first issue in 1896 as The Doctor\u2013Portrait of My Brother; see letter 138; Shannon to Whistler, 2 September 1896, GUL S55; Whistler to Mrs. William Whistler, postmarked 23 July 1895, GUL W726. Whistler had corresponded with Shannon and Ricketts in 1894 concerning Heinemann\u2019s proposal to publish a folio of lithographs by Shannon and Rothenstein; Shannon to Whistler, [January/February 1894], GUL S54; Whistler to Ricketts, 28 February 1894, GUL LB1/152.\n\nWay was probably referring to Whistler\u2019s earlier plans to exhibit his lithographs in London; see letter 120 n. 64.\n\nFGA 152.

The French section dominated the exhibition, comprising some 1,260 lithographs and filling some 90 pages of the catalogue. In contrast, the British section occupied only twelve pages, and the historical and reproductive works were exhibited together with original lithographs by contemporary artists; among the lithographs exhibited by British artists were two by T. R. Way: Au Bord de la mer, no. 1372, and Le Port, no. 1373. The British section would have been much smaller if not for the efforts of Sir Frederic Leighton, Alfred Gilbert, and Frederick Goulding, who persuaded many artists who had not made lithographs before to make drawings on transfer paper expressly for the centenary show (see letter 141 n. 124). For details of the exhibition, see Centenaire de la lithographie, 1795\u20131895: Catalogue officiel de l\u2019Exposition (Paris, 1895), reproduced in facsimile in Exhibitions of Modern Prints, Modern Art in Paris: Two Hundred Catalogues of the Major Exhibitions, ed. Theodore Reff, no. 26 (New York and London, 1981).\n\nWhistler entertained a longstanding antipathy toward the British art establishment as represented by the Royal Academy of Art, of which Sir Frederic Leighton was President; Way (1912), p. 113. In 1872 Whistler\u2019s masterpiece, Arrangement in Gray and Black: Portrait of the Painter\u2019s Mother (YMSM 101; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), would have been rejected by the Royal Academy had it not been for the action of Sir William Boxall, who threatened to resign if the painting was not hung.\n\nSee letter 136 n. 111.\n\nJ.

Wellington Street / Strand / London  \nPostmarked: LYME-REGIS / C / SP / 27 / 95\n\nFrederick Goulding had set himself up as a lithographic printer in 1893; see letter 128 n. 90. In 1895 Frederic Leighton and Alfred Gilbert, both members of the Royal Academy, accepted an offer from Goulding to assist them in their plans to contribute to the international centenary exhibition of lithography in Paris; see letter 138 n. 116. Goulding supplied artists, including several Royal Academicians, with his own transfer paper and drawing materials, and printed their lithographs, which were exhibited in the British section in Paris. Some of these were reproduced in an article for The Studio in which Goulding discussed the importance of the new transfer paper he had invented and described the innovative techniques he had used, such as dragging the ink from the lines over the surface of the stone and introducing a second color stone that had been selectively wiped and printed in register with the first stone; Way (1912), pp. 112\u201313; [Gleeson White], \u201cLithographs and Their Printing: An Interview with Mr. Frederick Goulding,\u201d The Studio 6, no. 32 (November 1895), pp. 86\u2013101. When the major part of the British section of the Paris exhibition was exhibited by Dunthorne in November 1895, the catalogue introduction drew attention to Goulding\u2019s innovations and credited him with responsibility for the revival of lithography in England; app. V.2; see letter 154 n. 21.\n\nSee list of lithographs exhibited; letter 139. When Whistler had exhibited lithographs at the Champ de Mars and the Grafton Gallery in 1894, he had selected, for the most part, recently completed subjects, with the exception of The Dancing Girl (cat. 29); see letter 73 n. 109. Nevertheless, Whistler had sanctioned Thomas Way\u2019s choice of subjects, although he had also suggested that more recent works should be shown as well; letter 138; Way (1912), pp. 113\u201314.\n\nWhistler added La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle (cat. 106) and La Jolie New Yorkaise (cat. 99) to the list he had recommended in letter 138.\n\nThomas Way had selected Whistler\u2019s early lithographs because they demonstrated a wide range of techniques; letter 139; Way (1912), pp. 113\u201314. He took Whistler\u2019s reference to \u201chabit of technique\u201d to mean a concern for particular lithographic processes, such as lithotint, rather than a certain emphasis on the style or handling of materials; letter 142. French art tended more toward the expressive and eloquent brushwork or line, which created a sensation and illusion, rather than the more descriptive, illustrative manner of drawing that might be expected from the more conservative British entrants; Twyman (1970), pp. 248\u201349. Regarding Whistler\u2019s entries at the Paris exhibition, the artist wrote to Pennell that Thomas Way had done his best and that no great harm had been done; Whistler to Pennell, postmarked 8 October 1895, LCPC box 272. Whistler\u2019s lithographs at the Champ de Mars in 1894 had been greatly admired, and their essential impressionist quality had been noted; see \u201cLe Salon de 1894,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts, 3d p\u00e9r., 12 (July\u2013December 1894), p. 38.\n\nCat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125; letter 143.\n\nGUL W119. Single sheet, printed heading, written on two sides.\n\nThe drawings were cat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125; see letter 141 and letter 143. The proofing of these and other Lyme Regis subjects is recorded in app. II.4, among entries for October and November 1895.\n\nSee letter 141 n. 127.\n\nFGA 160. Two sheets (originally one folded sheet), written on three sides; seven pen-and-ink sketches on second side, by Whistler, of forge subjects (M 1443); addressed envelope.\n\nInscribed in pencil, in another hand, on verso of envelope, Sketches.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas R. Way. Junr. / 21. Wellington Street / Strand / London  \nPostmarked: LYME-REGIS / D / OC / 25 / 95 and LONDON / W.C. / S.M.P. / 7K / OC / 26 / 95\n\nAlthough the envelope catalogued with this letter is clearly postmarked Lyme-Regis / D / OC / 25 / 95, the contents of the letter place it earlier in the chronological sequence. Whistler\u2019s instructions about determining the \u201cchalked side\u201d of the transfer paper, his illustration of seven subjects he had sent to Way on September 27 (letter 141), and his pleasure at Way\u2019s liking the drawings (letter 142) all indicate that this letter was a response to letter 142, which is dated September 28. The envelope probably belonged to letter 150, which is without its envelope but is inscribed in pencil Oct 26 / 95. The envelope has been retained in the original Freer catalogue order because it is inscribed Sketches, which clearly refers to Whistler\u2019s illustrated letter.\n\nAccording to Way, Whistler considered The Master Smith (cat. 120) \u201cone of his most perfect lithographs\u201d; Way (1912), p. 116; letter 151. Way also referred to it as one of two drawings executed on the new grained paper that he sent to Whistler in Lyme Regis; Way (1912), p. 118. However, according to the correspondence, Way did not send the new transfer paper to Whistler until October (letter 144, letter 147, and letter 156). The Master Smith was in fact one of seven drawings sent to Way in September (letter 141), and T. R. Way\u2019s memory was therefore mistaken. The subjects drawn on Way\u2019s new transfer paper were Fifth of November (cat. 133) and Sunday, Lyme Regis (cat. 134); see letter 159 n. 38.\n\nGUL W120.

Way recorded a total of sixteen Lyme Regis subjects in his catalogue of 1905, and all but two of these were drawn on the thin, transparent French transfer paper Whistler liked to use in Paris; Way (1912), pp. 116\u201318; letter 105. The French paper, however, gave very uneven transfers in some seven Lyme Regis subjects and Whistler, according to Way, turned to a new grained transfer paper for two drawings, The Master Smith (cat. 120) and Sunday, Lyme Regis (cat. 134); Way (1912), p. 118. Way was mistaken in the case of the former subject; it was Fifth of November (cat. 133). See letter 159 n. 38.\n\nAddressed: To / Thomas R. Way. Junr. / 21. Wellington Street / Strand / London  \nPostmarked: LYME-REGIS / B / OC / 10 / 95\n\nWhistler exhibited Crimson Note: Carmen (YMSM 441; Hill-Stead Museum, Farmington, Conn.) at the Society of Portrait Painters in October 1895; letter 150.\n\nThe mention of \u201cnew proofs\u201d and \u201cthe last four\u201d probably refers to further proofs of some of the seven earlier subjects and to a group of four more recent subjects proved by Way (cat. 126, cat. 127, cat. 128, and cat. 129); letter 141, letter 142, and letter 143; see app. II.4, entries for 5 and 8 October 1895.\n\nThe \u201cLandlord\u201d was John Grove (cat. 26); see app. II.4, entry for 5 October\n\nFGA 159.

The first two drawings were among the seven Way had received by September 28 (see letter 142 and letter 143), and The Blacksmith and The Brothers were two of a later group which, according to this letter, also failed to transfer properly; see letter 145 n. 139.\n\nT. R. Way had suggested using a second stone and transparent transfer paper for adding work to Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73) in November 1893; letter 64. Proofs of Father and Son (cat. 123), The Blacksmith (cat. 127), and The Brothers (cat. 128), each with registration marks, are at the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow; but according to Way, Whistler never pursued the idea of using transfer paper for this purpose, and later worked directly on the stones; Way (1912), p. 116.\n\nSee letter 145 n. 138.\n\nGUL W122.

The latter two were printed by Belfond in 1893 and were known only through surviving proofs, since the stones had been lost when the firm ceased to exist; see letter 127 and letter 53 n. 19. Way added another thirty subjects to the 1905 edition, fifteen of which were printed in Paris; Girl with Bowl (cat. 118), printed by Lemercier in Paris and published in L\u2019Ymagier, was not recorded as a lithograph printed in Paris, probably because Way had also printed it in London; see letter 150 n. 5. Further Paris lithographs were catalogued by Kennedy (1914) and Levy (1975).
