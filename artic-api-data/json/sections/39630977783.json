Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThe title of this wood-block print, The Rape of Europa, did not originate with Gauguin. It received the title sometime after the artist\u2019s death, based on the association of the long-haired figure mounted on a bull at the center of the composition with the ancient myth of Europa\u2019s abduction by Zeus. Who originally assigned The Rape of Europa to this image remains unknown. Marcel Gu\u00e9rin subsequently listed the print as such in his 1927 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Gauguin\u2019s printed oeuvre, and the title has stood ever since.\n\nZeus, enamored of a young Phoenician woman named Europa, decides to seduce her. He transforms himself into a tame, white bull. The nymph, who gathers flowers along a shore, notices the bull, caresses his flanks, and climbs onto his back, whereupon the bull takes flight, heading with his captive to the island of Crete.\n\nTo best analyze Gauguin\u2019s composition, we turn to an impression that most closely corresponds to what Gauguin carved into his wood block, which is extant (fig. 102.2). At the far the left of the image stands a woman wearing a pareu. She holds freshly gathered flowers, which is indeed mentioned in the Europa myth and portrayed in depictions of her capture. Below her feet are two stone-like shapes, one of which Gauguin used to carve his name and the other to write in pen and ink the number 4. Occupying the middle is the bull, outfitted with an ornate harness, and the rider, who is nude. Despite the mounted figure\u2019s flowing hair, its gender is ambiguous. The area at the top of the image features a dark, curving form at the left and a crested bird of prey at the right with an unidentifiable animal in its talons. Traditional representations of the Europa myth include watery settings and show Europa sitting with legs on one side of the beast. The lack of these features and the enigmatic nature of the print\u2019s elements suggest that it could depict an entirely different narrative; there seems to be no ready interpretation for this complex, enigmatic scene.\n\nGauguin most likely did not depict the bull from life, but rather based it on an image in an illustrated periodical, book, or dictionary. The bull\u2019s harness is bedecked with an assortment of items, not unlike cattle in folkloristic (or folkloric) traditions that participate in communal processions or festivities. Such decorations are also documented in sculptures associated with the Hindu cult of Nandhi, the bull that serves as the mount for Shiva (see fig. 102.3, fig. 102.4).\n\nWhile the hunched posture and wind-blown hair of the rider suggest speed, the way Gauguin portrayed the bull contradicts such a reading, for the animal appears still, as if it stopped in its tracks. The only thing that defines the rider as female is the print\u2019s present title.\n\nThroughout European depictions of Europa mounted on the bull, she has been shown\u2014from antiquity (see fig. 102.5) to the High Renaissance (see fig. 102.6) to the Baroque (see fig. 102.7) to the confections of the Rococo (see fig. 102.8)\u2014sitting sidesaddle. Images of women riding in the same manner as men have could made fun of the former and could have sexual connotations as well (see fig. 102.9).\n\nFor the standing female and the bull, Gauguin looked to his 1898 oil painting Faa iheihi (Tahitian Pastoral), combining the woman from one side of the frieze-like painting and the horse (transformed in the print into the bull) from the opposite side (fig. 102.10 [W 569]).\n\nThe standing woman in Faa iheihi and the present print was ultimately informed (with slight modifications such as the position of the head) by one of the group of three monks captured in Isidore van Kinsbergen\u2019s photograph of a frieze from the Buddhist temple of Borobudur, in Central Java, of which Gauguin owned a copy (fig. 102.11). Gauguin first appropriated the figure for his painting Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary), executed in 1891, during his first sojourn in Tahiti (fig. 102.12 [W 428]). The standing female, often holding flowers, appears in a number of oil paintings and assorted works on paper from the same period, although depicted in a variety of contexts (fig. 102.13 [Kornfeld 54], fig. 102.14 [W 585], fig. 102.15 [W 586, fig. 102.16 W 573], fig. 102.17 [W 581], fig. 102.18 [W 582], fig. 102.19 [W 584], fig. 102.20, fig. 102.21 [W 622], and fig. 102.22 [Field 1973 106]).\n\nThe same is true for the horse and rider; however, the equestrians are depicted riding astride and sidesaddle (fig. 102.23 [W 571], fig. 102.24 [W 575], fig. 102.25 W 587], fig. 102.26 [Field 1973 70], fig. 102.27 [W 597], fig. 102.28 [Field 1973 104], fig. 102.29 [Rewald 108], fig. 102.30 Field 1973 134], fig. 102.31 [Field 1973 96], fig. 102.32 [Field 1973 130], fig. 102.33 [W 620], fig. 102.34 [W 623], fig. 102.35 [Field 1973 58, 95, 116], fig. 102.36 [W 636.]).\n\nThe crested bird\u2014most often a peacock or peahen\u2014is a stock figure in Gauguin\u2019s visual repertory. However, unlike the example in The Rape of Europa, whose talons clutch a large, hare-like creature (see fig. 102.37), for the most part such birds are not depicted as predators. Peacocks and peahens populate a range of works in multiple media. Some Gauguin did before he left Europe for Tahiti (fig. 102.38 [Gray 87] and fig. 102.39 [Rewald 30, Pickvance 52]); some during the artist\u2019s first stay in Tahiti (fig. 102.40 [W 484], fig. 102.41 [W 496]); during his stay in France (fig. 102.42 [Gray 109]), and during his second sojourn in Polynesia (fig. 102.43 [cat. 103.3], fig. 102.44 [W 622], and fig. 102.45 [Field 1973 103]).\n\nA common feature shared by the prints that make up the Suite of Late Woodblock Prints is that the left and/or right side is interpreted as a tree trunk featuring branches with various amounts of foliage that extend across the composition, creating a frame. The same is suggested here at the upper left, although Gauguin might not have finished articulating the trees branches and foliage. The dark shape he did define at the upper left thus can, in some impressions, be read as a threatening cloud.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">After Gauguin developed some proficiency carving the poor-quality, indigenous wood that he had learned to fashion into wood blocks for printing the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints, he began to innovate with the impressions he pulled from them. Although the majority were printed on fine, diaphanous sheets of paper, it was not until the printing of Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) that the artist realized that the papers\u2019 inherent translucency offered potential to further manipulate impressions to achieve aesthetically new and different results.\n\nBuilding on the potential reversibility of impressions printed on thin, translucent paper, when Gauguin carved the block for The Rape of Europa he uncharacteristically oriented his signature in the lower left of the block so that it is legible to the viewer (fig. 102.46). When impressions were pulled from the block, however, the signature was reversed. Given the artist\u2019s proficiency with wood-block carving, this was not an error. When he proceeded to mount these impressions face down onto secondary supports, he clearly knew that the signature would once again be legible in the proper orientation (fig. 102.47).\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin used a second, thicker paper to support the diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter paper. Using this technique Gauguin also prevented the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block or tearing when he lifted it from the block.\n\nThe printed black ink layer on the recto was adhered face down directly onto the secondary support. The rich black ink appears uneven overall. The verso of this impression, now facing the viewer, exhibits offset of residual black ink rich in oil (est.) that imparts a golden tone. The image from which the offset derives is illegible. Similar offset on the verso of the secondary support (fig. 102.48) derives from an identifiable source. When viewed under magnification, the ink is yellow ocher in tone. When the verso is digitally enhanced for clarity (fig. 102.49), it becomes clear that the ink is the result of partial offset from a second-state impression of Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (fig. 102.50 [see cat. 105] fig. 102.51). The identification of offsets provides valuable insight into Gauguin\u2019s studio practice (specifically, that he worked quickly and extemporaneously on multiple blocks and was rather untidy). The study of offsets also helps to establish a chronology of production. Since offset only occurs when ink is wet or damp, offset from an impression of one print onto the verso of another is indicative of working sessions in which two related blocks from the series were printed in succession.\n\nGauguin joined two pieces of paper in a most unconventional manner, taking advantage of the translucent quality of the mitsumata (est.) paper upon which he pulled this impression. When he flipped it over and adhered it face down onto a sheet of opaque ivory wove paper, it could be read as a mirror image of an unmounted impression. This sheet was substantially cut down relative to the overall size of the wood block from which it was printed. The block itself extends farther down along the bottom edge and much further to the left along that edge (fig. 102.52).\n\n231 \u00d7 205 mm (image/primary/secondary support)\n\nGauguin prided himself on his unique manipulation of wood: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice, and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d If read literally, this statement could at first glance seem to indicate that he carved images into one side of five wood blocks and ten images into the fronts and backs of five more blocks\u2014a common practice among artists with limited resources. Yet Gauguin was emphatic that no other artist made prints in the way he was describing. How, then, did his method differ? Exhaustive study in preparation for this publication of the dimensions, contours, printed grain patterns, and surface textures of the group of prints in addition to any extant blocks themselves reveals that Gauguin took thick pieces or planks of wood and crudely cut them down himself to reduce their thickness. Because indigenous wood was not commercially manufactured into regularly sized blocks, the unusual, irregular contours in the wood used by Gauguin provide topographic reference points from which they can be paired.\n\nThere can be no doubt that the wood blocks for The Rape of Europa and Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) derive from the same piece of wood, which Gauguin fashioned into two blocks, both extant. Not satisfied with simply having two smooth surfaces upon which to carve, the artist took one of these two blocks and turned it so that the contours of one would be at a 180-degree angle to the other when the blocks, which are already mirror images of each other, are placed side by side (fig. 102.53). In the block used for this print, Gauguin only minimally retained the saw-cut series of vertical striations along the left side of the block, opting instead to plane and sand them from the left and bottom edges of the block. To retain as much of the piece of wood as possible, he accepted its very irregular edges and the cracks that formed at right angles to them. Here, again, a significant amount of uncut wood forms a visual border around the central vignette. In addition to aesthetically creating bordered vignettes, these borders also provided structural stability, allowing the block to withstand the pressure exerted upon it during printing.\n\nThe two sheets of paper were adhered together by Gauguin. The striations of the brushstrokes used to apply the adhesive are readily visible in raking light. There are handling dents throughout, as well as a diagonal crease in the lower half of the sheet.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition.  \nHarriet K.

The printed side of the paper was pasted to a heavier paper support; thus, we are actually viewing the verso of the translucent printed sheet. As a result, the composition is in the same orientation as the wood block from which it was printed. For more on this process, see Technical Study.\n\nThe oil medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s technique, and printmaking techniques in general.\n\nThe estimation of yellow ocher (an iron oxide) is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s printmaking materials and techniques. The use of iron oxide inks such as ocher were identified by XRF analysis in impressions of Te atua (The God) ([link;140306|text=cat. 53.4]) and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.3), for example.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98.2), and mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nGauguin wrote to Vollard in January 1900: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d Gauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190.
