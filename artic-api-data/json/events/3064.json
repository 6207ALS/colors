    "description": "<p>The theme for this month's Intersections is the \u201cgender box.\u201d What kinds of traits or behaviors are expected of men and of women? What kinds of gender roles are prescribed or reinforced by the images we see? What are the limitations of these binaries and how do they relate to power and sexual violence? We\u2019ll discuss a selection of paintings in the museum\u2019s collection and how representations of women from the past might help us talk about gender roles today.</p><p>In this new interactive lecture series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Educators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p> </p>",
