    "description": "<p><strong>This event is SOLD OUT.</strong> A standby line will start at 7:00 p.m for tickets that become available.</p><p>Presented in response to the new Deering Family Galleries of Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and Armor, Chicago band Joan of Arc perform their original score to the silent film <em>The Passion of Joan of Arc</em> (1928). As they perform an original score to the haunting depictions of the trial and execution of Joan of Arc, the artists ask the audience to consider the very different historical moments that coexist within the presentation\u2014a 1928 film based on the transcripts of a trial from 1431 as seen through a 21st-century lens. Adding an additional contemporary filter, brownshoesonly performs live visual processing to the accompanying projection.</p><p>The program is presented outside in the Art Institute's Stanley McCormick Court North, also known as the North Garden. In the event of bad weather, this program will take place in Fullerton Hall. </p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s Accessibility page for more information. </p>",
