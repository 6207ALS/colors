    "intro_transcript": "<p>You\u2019re listening to Myth and Scandal, an audio tour through the Ancient Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Egyptian collection. The artworks in these galleries come to us from centuries ago and oceans far away, but the people who made and lived with these artworks have more in common with us than you might think.</p>\n<p>Like us, they were drawn in by a good story. And they used those stories to, yes, shock and entertain, but also to teach morality, explain natural phenomena, and generally make sense of their world. These stories were passed down for generations, eventually making these characters as well-known as those in today\u2019s popular culture. Whether it\u2019s a boy wizard with a lighting bolt on his forehead or a king from the futuristic country of Wakanda, we human beings can\u2019t help ourselves when it comes to telling epic stories. And on this tour we\u2019re going to consider why that is by telling you the myths and histories behind these artworks.</p>\n<p>You should know that these stories often feature mature sexual or violent themes that may not be appropriate for every listener. If that\u2019s not of interest to you may want to skip this one.</p>\n<p>As with all of our tours, we recommend you take the stops in order; however, feel to jump around using the numbers listed on the label next to the artwork. Enjoy the tour and thank you for listening.</p>\n",
