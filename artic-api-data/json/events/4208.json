Dick's&nbsp;<em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em>, this year's One Book, One Chicago is looking to the future\u2014and all the shapes it can take<em>.&nbsp;</em>Much of artist Lee Bontecou's work stemmed from her fear and fascination about a post-WWII, nuclear future, resulting in images of black voids, cosmic orbs, floating teeth, and mutant flowers.</p><p>In this interactive and conversational gathering, we\u2019ll dive into these conflicting ideas by visiting the exhibition <em>Into the Void: Prints of Lee Bontecou</em> (on view January 26-May 5), and then create our own expressions about the future through writing and drawing exercises.&nbsp;</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p>",
