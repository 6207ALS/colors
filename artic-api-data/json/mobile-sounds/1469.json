Vishnu one of the most important deities in the pantheon of Hindu gods is revered as the great protector of the universe.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: Vishnu often takes different incarnations in order to save the universe. But in this instance, you\u2019re seeing Vishnu fly across the heavens on the bird Garuda. He is seated in a yogic posture with his arms together in the center. And he is accompanied on either side by attendants who you can see venerating him.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: According to sacred texts as preserver of the entire cosmos Vishnu took flight to survey not only the heavens but also earthly realms in the underworld. You\u2019ll notice Garuda\u2019s fierce expression as he spreads his wings. This wooden polychrome sculpture was made in Indonesia during the nineteenth century. And the colorful pigments used are still vibrant. The statue was probably part of a sendi, the base of a pillar that supported beams and columns in a Balinese ceremonial pavilion. The winged deity Garuda remains a popular figure in Indonesian culture today even lending his name to the national airline.</p>\n",
