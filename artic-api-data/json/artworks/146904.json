    "description": "<p>Best known for meticulously crafted pieces made of stone, metal, and concrete, Scott Burton consistently demonstrated a profound awareness of aesthetics and utility. Creating works that blur the boundaries between sculpture and furniture, he began his early studio pieces from the 1970s as found objects, usually mass-produced furniture. In the 1980s, he moved squarely into the realm of original design, producing rigorously reductive, geometric, and abstract pieces such as <em>Low Piece (Bench)</em>. An example of Burton\u2019s mature style, this piece conveys his passion for combining fine art and practical design and, in the process, opening up the scope of inquiry for both disciplines. All of Burton\u2019s late works, including studio objects presented in traditional gallery spaces or site-specific projects for public areas, carry the potential for practical public use. Visitors are invited to use this sculpture as a bench.</p>\n",
