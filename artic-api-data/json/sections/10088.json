Whistler completed several seascapes during a visit to the French seaside resort town of Trouville in the fall of 1865, writing to his friend Lucas Ionides that October, \u201cI am staying here to finish two or three sea pieces which I wish to bring back with me\u2014I believe they will be very fine\u2014and worth quite anything of the kind I have ever done\u2014This is a charming place\u2014although now the season is quite over and every one has left\u2014but the effects of sea and sky are finer than during the milder weather.\u201d\n\nWhistler and companion Joanna Hiffernan were greeted upon their arrival in Trouville by the artist Gustave Courbet, with whom Whistler had grown acquainted as an art student in Paris. Courbet, too, was captivated by the \u201ceffects of sea and sky\u201d he observed there, but a comparison between his Trouville paintings (for example, Low Tide at Trouville [fig. 9.1]) and Whistler\u2019s shows just how far Whistler had strayed from his earlier adherence to Courbet\u2019s Realist approach. Indeed, by 1867\u2014just two years later\u2014Whistler would bemoan Courbet\u2019s influence on his work, calling it \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\n\nRather than following Courbet\u2019s model of rapid brushwork and a naturalistic color scheme, as he had in Grey and Silver: Old Battersea Reach, Whistler took a radically different track in Trouville, employing a restricted palette of muted grays and greens that he applied in long bands of thin layers across the length of the canvas. These overlapping horizontal brushstrokes create an impression of movement in the water but also draw attention to the painting\u2019s surface and intensify the sense of flatness that pervades the work. The reductive composition pares the scene down to its barest essentials and pushes them toward abstraction. Though the work remains recognizable as a seascape, significant attention is paid to the exploration of the material qualities of paint on canvas and the subtleties of overlapping color. Whistler\u2019s emphasis on the physical attributes of his medium are nowhere so evident as in the sailboats, where the translucent paint, applied in distinct strokes, visibly blends with the gray-green shades of the sea below the horizon line and the gray-blue hues of the sky above. As a reviewer for the Athenaeum characterized the painting, \u201cIt is simply a vigorous and beautiful study of colour, and bright, yet soft tone.\u201d Whistler\u2019s emphasis on his work\u2019s formal properties reveals his growing embrace of an \u201cart for art\u2019s sake\u201d philosophy prioritizing an artwork\u2019s visual appearance over other criteria.\n\nThe spareness and flatness of the painting, together with its high horizon line, suggest a new source of inspiration for Whistler\u2019s work: Japanese woodblock prints. Following the signing of the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, which greatly expanded Japan\u2019s trade with the West, Japanese goods began flooding into Europe. Alongside other artists moving in French and English avant-garde circles, Whistler became an early and voracious collector of Japanese art. Prints by ukiyo-e artists such as Utagawa Hiroshige, who often depicted marine views, provided compelling visual sources (see Ejiri\u2014No. 19 [fig. 9.2] and Miya: Shichiri Ferry Crossing, Gate to the Atsuta Shrine, and Nezame Village\u2014No. 42 [fig. 9.3] both from the series \u201cFifty-Three Stations of the Tokaido\u201d). In his newfound interest in this type of art, Whistler was in good company\u2014the artist \u00c9douard Manet had drawn on analogous Japanese sources when painting a strikingly similar composition, Sea View, Calm Weather (fig. 9.4), one year earlier. But whereas Manet\u2019s vivid palette more closely references the pure, saturated colors of many ukiyo-e prints, Whistler\u2019s tones are understated. The grays and greens of the sea in Trouville are subtly modulated by lower layers of brown and purple pigment and supplemented with touches of blue and white. The gray clouds, too, have a purple cast, tinged with notes of light yellow. Both Whistler\u2019s and Manet\u2019s seascapes would eventually be acquired by the same patrons, Bertha Honor\u00e9 and Potter Palmer.\n\nThe innovative approaches to painting that Whistler and Manet favored, which pushed the limits of Western pictorial art, were not always easy for the public to swallow. Whistler\u2019s painting sparked controversy in 1873 when it was exhibited as The Yacht Race\u2013A Symphony in B Sharp, a title not submitted by the artist and a parody of the by-then ubiquitous musically inspired titles he often assigned to his works to highlight their nonliteral meanings. In his characteristically acerbic manner, Whistler responded to the slight by writing to the Athenaeum, \u201cThe titles I have given to my pictures have been intended by me as a key to my work simply; but I cannot expect others, who do not understand them, to refuse themselves any witticism, like the above brilliant parody, on the subject.\u201d The artist\u2014as usual\u2014had the last word.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\"> Kimberley MuirThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 9.5).\n\nSigned (bottom right, in green paint): Whistler (fig. 9.6).\n\nWhistler painted the work on a relatively coarse plain-weave canvas. The average thread count (standard deviation) is 11.3V (0.6) \u00d7 12.2H (0.2) threads/cm. The current stretcher is not the original one. The ground is thick, filling the interstices of the fabric weave, and consists of three distinct layers (fig. 9.7 and fig. 9.8). Each of the ground layers is lead white based but contains different proportions of extenders, including calcium compounds, iron oxide or earth pigments, and barium sulfate. The canvas may have been commercially primed, or, given the cumulative thickness of the ground layers, Whistler may have applied an additional layer over a commercial priming. On the surface of the painting, the ground has a warm, off-white hue. Diagonal brushstrokes related to the application or brushing out of the top ground layer are visible, microscopically, in the sky where the paint was thinly applied (fig. 9.9).\n\nWhile the painting has a fairly smooth, flat surface overall, Whistler built up some low texture using brushstrokes of bodied paint and possibly also a palette knife or painting knife in both the initial and the surface paint layers. In the sky, which appears to have been painted first and mainly in a single wet-in-wet session, he used long, horizontal or slightly undulating strokes in varying shades of gray. In places the paint was thinly applied, leaving the brush-marked texture and the warm, off-white tone of the ground visible on the surface. Some of the clouds, by contrast, were formed with thick strokes of cream to pale yellow (fig. 9.10). Purer colors not completely incorporated into the paint mixtures provide streaks of slightly more intense hues where the sun breaks through the otherwise gray sky (fig. 9.11).\n\nBefore painting the water, Whistler applied a toning layer on top of the ground on the lower third of the canvas (fig. 9.12). Paint cross sections show that this comprises a light-brown layer and, at least intermittently, a pale-purple layer on top (fig. 9.13). This toning layer imparts a sense of depth to the foreground water where it was allowed to show through the range of gray tones applied on top. Subtle texture created through low ridges and thicker applications of lead white\u2013rich paint provide texture and a feeling of movement in the water. The whitecaps in the lower left corner, for example, were rendered with fairly thick, creamy paint, and the smooth surface suggests that Whistler used a knife as well as brushes in this section. The surface of the water was realized with layers of thin, fluid paint, with subtle color shifts achieved by incorporating, but not completely mixing, white, blue, and warm ocher tones into the gray paint (fig. 9.14). A localized region of very fluid paint application is visible in the lower left corner, where the paint swirled on the surface (fig. 9.15).\n\nThe boats were painted after the sky and the sea had been established. Each boat was constructed out of a few quick wet-in-wet brushstrokes. The paint was very fluid and thinly brushed on (fig. 9.16). The horizon\u2014very straight but nonetheless executed freehand\u2014can be seen continuously underneath the sails. The more-opaque greenish-gray paint of the distant water was applied last and slightly overlaps the edges of the boats and the sky along the horizon.\n\nThe palette includes lead white, red and yellow iron oxide or earth pigments, umber, cobalt blue, Prussian blue, vermilion, and bone black. Although relatively thinly painted overall, the cross sections show that, in the areas sampled, the painting was built up in multiple superimposed wet-in-wet layers (fig. 9.17). Whistler probably thinned his paints with added medium to achieve more fluid consistencies. He used brushes, including 1 cm\u2013wide flat brushes (based on the width and shape of brushstrokes), as well as a knife in places. There is an indentation, made in the wet paint, along the right edge, possibly related to transporting the work when it was still wet.\n\nIn 1922 the painting was lined with an aqueous adhesive, cleaned, and varnished. In 1960 the existing lining canvas was infused with wax. In 1988 Faye Wrubel inpainted minor losses and discolored retouching. The painting currently appears to have a synthetic varnish. There are residues of old, yellowed, natural-resin varnish in the recesses of the paint texture. The surface has an even, satiny sheen.\n\nOverall, the painting is in good condition. The original tacking edges have been removed, probably at the time of the aqueous lining. The paint is somewhat flattened and the appearance of the canvas weave texture is exaggerated in places, likely from the heat and pressure used in the lining. The painting is stretched taut and in plane. There are a few small, scattered losses in the interior of the painting and tiny losses along the cut edges of the canvas. Numerous tiny, detached paint and ground fragments are embedded in excess wax adhesive along the edges of the original canvas. There is retouching around the edges and associated with the small losses in the interior of the painting and some scratches in the sky. There is a random network of pronounced cracks, consisting of linear, branched, and impact cracks, some with slightly opened apertures. Some of the cracks may be related to the thick, brittle nature of the ground. Differential layering and drying rates have resulted in more intense cracking in certain areas (fig. 9.18). There is some abrasion around the edges of the painting in the frame rebate area. There are a few remnants of paper from the edge strips that were removed prior to the wax impregnation. There are deposits of a thin, brownish liquid in a broad area of the lower right corner that is in intimate contact with the paint layer and appears to be of long standing.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Trouville (Grey and Green, the Silver Sea) is published as Trouville in Andrew McLaren Young, Margaret F.

Though Whistler wrote in his letter that he was at work on two or three paintings, he likely produced several more than that during his stay in Trouville. Apart from the Art Institute\u2019s painting, others identified as having been produced during this period include: Blue and Silver: Trouville (1865; Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC); Crepuscule in Opal: Trouville (1865; Toledo Museum of Art); Harmony in Blue and Silver: Trouville (1865; Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston); The Sea (1865; Montclair Art Museum, New Jersey); and Sea and Rain: Variations in Violet and Green (1865; University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor).\n\nCourbet would later reminisce to Whistler about their time in Trouville, \u201cwhich let us paint together the space, the sea and fish to the horizon, we paid ourselves with dreams and space.\u201d See Gustave Courbet to Whistler, Feb. 14, 1877, GUW, no. 00695.

The Palmers purchased Manet\u2019s Sea View, Calm Weather around 1902. Ownership of both paintings passed to the Palmers\u2019 sons, Honor\u00e9 and Potter Palmer, upon Bertha Palmer\u2019s death in 1918, and were given by them to the Art Institute in 1922. For the ownership histories of the Whistler and Manet paintings, see records in the curatorial object files in the departments of American Art and European Painting and Sculpture; and for the Whistler painting, see YMSM, 40 (cat. 70) and the Art Institute's online record.\n\nThis alternative title was apparently written in an unknown hand on a label affixed to the back of the work at the time of the 1873 exhibition; see Charles William Deschamps to Whistler, Nov. 10/22, 1873, GUW, no. 00830. The spurious title includes an additional layer of humor apparent to those with music-reading knowledge: the enharmonic spelling of B-sharp is \u201cC,\u201d creating a pun on the word \u201csea\u201d\u2014a reference to the painting\u2019s subject. Whistler acknowledged this play on words, though he apparently did not find it amusing, calling it a \u201csenseless pun\u201d in his letter to the Athenaeum of Nov. 22, 1873. See GUW, no. 13150.

In the cross-sectional analysis, the upper ground layer appears slightly whiter and more opaque, which seems to be related to the inclusion of fewer fillers in that layer. Also of note, no barium was detected in the upper ground layer in the sample analyzed, while barium sulfate was indicated in both lower ground layers. The ground composition was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX).
