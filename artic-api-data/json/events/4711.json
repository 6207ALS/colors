    "description": "<p>Members of the four-time Grammy-winning contemporary music sextet Eighth Blackbird present a series of musical love letters to masterworks from the Art Institute collection. Performances take place in the galleries throughout the museum.</p><h3>Program notes:<br><br>With<em> Love Letters</em>, Eighth Blackbird introduces an intimate new perspective on the relationships between music and visual arts. Rather than explore their shared aesthetics, we seek to empathize with specific works in the Art Institute collection, asking, \u201cWhat would this work of art like to hear?\u201d We wonder what a painting thinks about as it hangs on a gallery wall day after day. What kind of performance would be meaningful to the artwork? This is a fun way for us to reconsider what a work of art communicates, which of its characteristics are distinctive attributes of the work in a personal sense. What if a work had a sense of humor? What if it was self-consciousness, or proud of some particular part of itself?</h3><h3>&nbsp;We\u2019ll be popping up in selected galleries, sending our \u201clove letters\u201d to specific works in the collection\u2014performing for the works themselves. In so doing we seek to deepen our relationships with the works through a personal offering, the gift of an intentional performance. The public is invited to eavesdrop. </h3><h3>\u2014Matthew Duvall of Eighth Blackbird</h3><h2><strong>Personnel</strong></h2><p>\tNathalie Joachim, flutes<br>\tMatt Albert, violin<br>\tMatthew Duvall, percussion<br>\tZachary Good, clarinets<br>\tNick Photinos, cello<br>\tLisa Kaplan, piano<br></p><h2><strong>Repertoire</strong></h2><p><strong>Gallery 201</strong><br>Elisabeth de La Guerre, <em>harpsichord prelude</em> (arr.

Over the course of more than two decades, Eighth Blackbird has continually pushed at the edges of what it means to be a contemporary chamber ensemble, presenting distinct programs in Chicago, nationally, and internationally, reaching audiences totaling tens of thousands.</p><p><strong>About Artists Connect</strong><br>Artists Connect is a series of in-gallery programs that highlight the creative process. Artists, poets, dancers, and musicians engage with works of art, making connections to their own practice and inspiring new ways of understanding the Art Institute\u2019s collection.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
