Ruskin trial, which opens the volume, the book consists of carefully edited and annotated reprints of selected writings penned by or pertaining to Whistler, sourced from letters, periodical articles, pamphlets, lectures, and exhibition catalogues. Fittingly, the volume\u2019s path to publication was not without its own controversy. After originally devising it as a joint venture with the American journalist Sheridan Ford, Whistler attempted to postpone work on The Gentle Art in 1889, sending Ford a check for 10 guineas to compensate him for his efforts. Ford furiously responded by returning the check and subsequently endeavoring to publish the book himself, which led to a protracted series of legal maneuvers and evasions that spanned several countries as Whistler sought to quash the unsanctioned edition. The artist then proceeded to develop his own \u201cauthorized\u201d version with the help of London publisher William Heinemann.\n\nTo set his work apart from Ford\u2019s version of the text, Whistler supervised every aspect of the new volume\u2019s design and production and filled it with personalized touches. Among these were the abundant, highly individualized butterflies that appear on many of its pages. Whistler had begun signing his artworks with a stylized butterfly monogram in 1869, following the lead of friend and fellow artist Albert Joseph Moore, who had adopted a stylized Greek anthemion as his signature in 1866. Whistler modified the form of the butterfly over time, freely adapting his design to maximize its expressive or aesthetic impact. By 1890 the emblem had become so closely associated with him that, as Daniel E. Sutherland notes in his biography of the artist, the butterfly illustrations on the cover and title page of The Gentle Art alone sufficed to identify Whistler as the work\u2019s author.\n\nEach butterfly in The Gentle Art is based on an original sketch drawn by Whistler, which was then transcribed in exacting detail onto a printing block. The Art Institute\u2019s collection includes three sheets of Whistler\u2019s original butterfly sketches, which were used to illustrate pages 17, 221, 238, 242, and 248 of the volume\u2019s first edition. The lower right butterfly in Three Butterflies (cat. 30) apparently did not measure up to Whistler\u2019s high standards and does not appear in the text, while the other two on the sheet underwent slight modifications between the sketch and the finished book. The faint circles visible around these latter two butterflies in the original drawing may have been markings to indicate which ones out of the three were to be used.\n\nThe artist was obsessively attentive to the appearance and placement of his butterflies on the printed page. His contemporary biographers Elizabeth and Joseph Pennell wrote, \u201cHours were spent often in the \u2018arranging\u2019 of a single Butterfly. . . . Whistler was constantly at the Ballantyne Press, where the book was printed. He chose the type, he spaced the text, he placed the Butterflies, each of which he designed especially to convey a special meaning.\u201d As with each of the three Art Institute drawings, Whistler\u2019s graceful insects often acquired a tail with a sting, a physical manifestation of the barbs hurled at various foes. Indeed, as one reviewer wrote, \u201cWhistler\u2019s well-known device . . . should not be without this appendage if it is in any degree to represent the genius of its owner and inventor.\u201d The impish butterfly seen in cat. 29 is deployed in the text to punctuate jibes at William Powell Frith and Oscar Wilde (fig. 28\u201330.1 and fig. 28\u201330.2). Another in mid-pounce (cat. 28) is also directed at Oscar Wilde (fig. 28\u201330.3), while two of the butterflies from cat. 30 prance triumphantly away after successful attacks on reporters from the Pall Mall Gazette (fig. 28\u201330.4 and fig. 28\u201330.5).\n\nFriends and reviewers alike remarked on the prevalence of these fantastical creatures in The Gentle Art. The author and political activist Emilie Venturi pronounced it the \u201cmost amazing and ever renewed delight\u201d of the volume, while the Symbolist poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 opined that the butterflies alone could perfectly constitute a book. Whether or not critics appreciated the text\u2019s intent, they agreed that it was both visually appealing and inventive, one proclaiming it \u201cthe most original book of the season.\u201d By applying his unique eye and customary flair to the design of the butterflies and of the volume as a whole, Whistler succeeded in creating a work of art as original as any in his oeuvre. Far from simply a literary record, The Gentle Art became in itself a precious object, an \u201cartistic autobiography\u201d in form and content.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Butterfly corresponds to Margaret F.

See MacDonald (1995), 120 (cat. 357). For the early development of Moore\u2019s anthemion signature, see Robyn Asleson, Albert Moore (London: Phaidon, 2000), 86.\n\nSutherland, Whistler: A Life for Art\u2019s Sake, 245. For a useful visual aid of the evolution of Whistler\u2019s butterfly signature over the course of his career, particularly in his drawings, see MacDonald (1995), xiv.\n\nAs Margaret MacDonald notes in her entry on the drawing in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9, one of the antennas on the butterfly at bottom left was slightly altered in the printed version, which appears on page 248 of The Gentle Art. In the case of the butterfly at top left, the shortest antenna has been eliminated in the printed version, which appears on page 221. MacDonald does not associate the top-left butterfly with the illustration on page 221 of The Gentle Art. The present author, however, considers it a distinct match, because of the drawing\u2019s close correspondence with the illustration on page 221 in every respect apart from the missing antenna, and because there is no other extant sketch that corresponds to that illustration. The fact that the antenna of the bottom-left butterfly was altered in the publication makes similar alterations to the design of the top-left butterfly even more plausible. See MacDonald (1995), 456 (cat. 1259).\n\nPennell and Pennell, Life of Whistler, 2:106. In a diary entry, Whistler\u2019s friend Alan Summerly Cole recorded a pronouncement by Whistler that each butterfly indeed held a special significance. See Cole\u2019s diary entry for July 6, 1890, GUW, no. 03432.\n\nThis appendage to Whistler\u2019s butterfly signature first appeared around the time of the Ruskin trial (1878).
