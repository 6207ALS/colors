    "description": "<p>Bruce Nauman\u2019s wildly influential, relentlessly imitated work explores the poetics of confusion, anxiety, boredom, entrapment, and failure. One of the artist\u2019s most spectacular achievements to date, <em>Clown Torture</em> consists of two rectangular pedestals, each supporting two pairs of stacked color monitors; two large color-video projections on two facing walls; and sound from all six video displays. The monitors play four narrative sequences in perpetual loops, each chronicling an absurd misadventure of a clown (played to brilliant effect by the actor Walter Stevens). In \u201cNo, No, No, No (Walter),\u201d the clown incessantly screams the word <em>no</em> while jumping, kicking, or lying down; in \u201cClown with Goldfish,\u201d the clown struggles to balance a fish bowl on the ceiling with the handle of a broom; in \u201cClown with Water Bucket,\u201d the clown repeatedly opens a door booby-trapped with a bucket of water that falls on his head; and finally, in \u201cPete and Repeat,\u201d the clown succumbs to the terror of a seemingly inescapable nursery rhyme. The simultaneous presentation and the relentless repetition creates an almost painful sensory overload. With both clown and viewer locked in an endless loop of failure and degradation, the humor soon turns to horror.</p>\n",
