    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: You may recognize this woman from a previous painting we discussed. Curator, Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: This is Charlotte Guillemet, the wife of Jules Guillemet. We\u2019ve seen her before in the painting called In the Conservatory, seated with her husband. And Manet seems to have really fixated on Madam.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Charlotte Guillemet was one of many models that fascinated Manet, perhaps in part because of her sense of style.</p>\n<p>Gloria: The fashion is just extremely up to date. Manet was so interested in feminine fashion and while he did pick out the outfits for some of his sitters, in this case with Madam Guillemet he would not have needed to because she managed a boutique and she herself was a fashion icon.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Guillemet was not only a model for Manet, she was also his friend. By this point in Manet\u2019s life, he was quite ill. He took frequent trips to the countryside for treatments during which he often felt disconnected from the urban life. His friendships became a life line.</p>\n<p>Gloria: His friends became even more important to him because he felt very isolated. There are letters to her sister where he mentions that he hopes Madam Guillemet, this Madam Guillemet, will come to visit him.</p>\n<p>Narrator: You can find a number of these whimsical and elegant letters in this gallery, which Manet addressed to his friends in Paris.</p>\n",
