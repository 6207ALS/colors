    "description": "<p>Hear from artist Dara Birnbaum (American, born 1946), who emerged as a pioneer of video art in the mid-1970s, when many women artists challenged the gender biases of mass media and popular culture. Early on she disrupted and deconstructed the language of television, in order to reveal embedded stereotypes and expectations. For four decades Birnbaum has remained highly active in media arts internationally, providing provoking single-channel and installation works as exhibited within major institutions, on screen, and in public spaces. Her works are among&nbsp;the most influential&nbsp;and innovative contributions to the contemporary&nbsp;discourse on art and television.</p><p>Presented by the Society for Contemporary Art</p>",
