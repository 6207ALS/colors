    "description": "<p>Homer\u2019s decision to move to Maine in 1883 presumably indicated his desire to live close to nature\u2014Prout\u2019s Neck was a peninsula known for its rocky coastline and dramatic views of the Atlantic Ocean. <em>Prout\u2019s Neck, Breakers</em>, later the model for the monumental oil painting <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/homer/resource/580\"><em>Early Morning after a Storm at Sea</em></a>, shows the artist\u2019s continued fascination with the power of the sea.  However, unlike his earlier marine works, this and other watercolors made at Prout\u2019s Neck are usually devoid of human activity, exploring nature\u2019s grandeur in its many manifestations. This work also exemplifies important aspects of Homer\u2019s technique as a watercolorist, including the way he layered strokes of color\u2014using a range of light and dark blues\u2014to create the depth and force of the breaking waves.  He used the white of the paper to produce a brilliant sheen on the sea, juxtaposed with a hazy sky above.</p>\n",
