His work looks into the relationship between sound and people and explores how music and sound affect their minds. His sound, art, and installations have been exhibited all over the world.</p><p>>After studying industrial design at Nihon University, Suzuki worked for the Japanese art unit Maywa Denki, which created the Otamatone. He then moved to London to study design products at the Royal College of Art under the tutelage of Ron Arad. During this period, he also worked with Yamaha to produce musical experiences.</p><p>>In 2013 Suzuki started teaching at Royal College of Art and became a research consultant for Disney, New Radiophonic Workshop, and Teenage Engineering.</p><p>>During this same year, he set up Yuri Suzuki Design Studio, focusing on research and development and consultancy work in sound and design. His clients include Google, Moog, will.i.am, and Panasonic, to name a few.</p><p>>Also in 2013, Suzuki created a DIY musical instrument called the Ototo, a musical invention kit which allows anyone to create their own electronic musical instrument, with Mark McKeague and Joseph Pleass as Dentaku Ltd.
