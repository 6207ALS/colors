    "description": "<p>After studying in London, Paris, and at the Hague, George Hitchcock settled in 1884 in the Netherlands, living and working for twenty years in Egmond. Attracted to the region\u2019s landscape and peasant communities, the artist specialized in scenes featuring women in traditional dress set among voluptuous, blooming flowers. Here, Hitchcock revised the environment behind the Dutch flower seller, editing out other houses nearby in favor of a bucolic vista. Although he employed academic techniques such as fine modeling of his figures, Hitchcock nevertheless earned a reputation as a daring colorist for the brilliant hues and open brushwork that likewise characterize his compositions.</p>\n",
