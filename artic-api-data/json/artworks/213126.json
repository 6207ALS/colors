    "description": "<p>Dutch design company Royal VKB\u2019s ID/Cutlery showcases international designers\u2019 individual reinterpretations of this ubiquitous type. Ineke Hans based her design on the archetypical shape of cutlery, subtly enlarging the forms and thicknesses to make it robust and heavy. Though the recto is clean and minimal, the verso has an elegantly engraved surface with varying patterns that are reminiscent of historical decorative design. For their cutlery, also exhibited in this case, Atelier Bow-Wow imagined the dining table as a primitive landscape where nature prevails. The designers combined the minimalistic shapes of branches and leaves to form their flatware collection. Further illustrating the concept of a primitive landscape, users can combine the three main pieces to form the shape of a tepee.</p>\n",
