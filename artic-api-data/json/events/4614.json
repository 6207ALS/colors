Curators Elizabeth McGoey and Elizabeth Siegel take you on a tour of this special exhibition, an unexpected combination of photography and early American folk art that is the first of its kind.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that the image on this page is for reference purposes only and may not be featured during the gallery talk.</p>",
