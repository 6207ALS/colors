II.3, II.4, III.2, V.1  \nSelected Literature: Way (1912), pp. 20, 87; Way (1913), p. 282  \nLifetime Exhibitions: London 1887\u201388 (no. 532); Paris 1891 (no. 965); London 1895\u201396 (no. 29); Chicago 1900a (no. 131); Chicago 1900b (no. 9); New York 1901 (no. 127)\n\nLike Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14), Victoria Club is a view from Way\u2019s printing offices on Wellington Street. The Victoria Club, located at 18 Wellington Street, was a \u201csocial and sporting club\u201d connected primarily with horse racing. For this drawing Whistler used a more finely grained transfer paper than the sheet on which he had sketched Gaiety Stage Door. In both scenes he adopted a quick, abbreviated drawing style to describe the facades of the buildings and the figures gathered in the street before them. By the time the stone bearing Victoria Club was printed for the Notes portfolio in 1887, three figures had been removed from the image. The artist\u2019s butterfly signature is similar in style and execution to that found in Gaiety Stage Door, and was almost certainly added directly to the stone in 1887.\n\nTrial proofs were pulled before the removal of three figures (two children and a man carrying a large bundle) and a few stray marks in the foreground, and before the addition of Whistler\u2019s butterfly signature to the stone.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream chine (Japanese paper, 210 \u00d7 156 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (420 \u00d7 320 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, First State.\n\nScraping has been used to remove three figures and scattered small marks in the foreground from the stone. Whistler\u2019s butterfly monogram has been added directly to the stone at lower left.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory laid paper (310 \u00d7 199 mm), signed; tan laid paper (305 \u00d7 239 mm); SC, ivory laid paper (308 \u00d7 205 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3), ivory laid paper (311 \u00d7 203 mm), signed; cream laid paper (307 \u00d7 206 mm); cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 196 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (289 \u00d7 205 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Brooklyn, TBM; and Cleveland, CMA.\n\nPublished edition. One hundred impressions of Victoria Club were issued in Notes portfolios. Notes impressions were printed on cream Japanese paper (large sets) or grayish ivory proofing paper (small sets), mounted on white plate paper, which has often discolored to off-white or ivory.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream chine (Japanese paper, 234 \u00d7 156 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (487 \u00d7 360 mm), signed; MWC, cream chine (Japanese paper, 235 \u00d7 156 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (497 \u00d7 381 mm), signed.
