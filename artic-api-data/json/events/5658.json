    "description": "<p>When planning an exhibition, the medium is the message. Unfortunately, not every medium lends itself to enduring the wear of time. In anticipation of the exhibition <a href=\"/exhibitions/9622/lygia-pape-tecelares\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Lygia Pape: Tecelares</em></a>, paper conservator Mar\u00eda Cristina Rivera Ramos worked closely with the exhibition's curator to examine over 100 prints and matrices created by the artist. Ramos approached Pape's work with the eyes, sensitivity, and intellectual questioning of a paper conservator, deeply considering the artist's materials and techniques alongside the condition of the work in order to ready these masterpieces for display.</p><p>Join us to hear from the conservator herself on the questions and nuances that emerged in her treatment of Pape's timeless work.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination. Anyone who would like to continue to wear a mask is welcome to do so. <a href=\"/visit#expect\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more</a> about our visiting policies and what to expect.</p><p>If you have any questions about programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.</p><p>Closed captioning will be available for this program.
