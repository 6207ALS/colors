    "description": "<p>Cleopatra (69\u201330 BCE) was queen of Egypt when the Roman Empire was gradually expanding into the wealthy eastern Mediterranean. By allying herself first with the powerful Roman generals Julius Caesar (100\u201344 BCE) and then Mark Antony (83\u201330 BCE), she hoped to maintain her country\u2019s independence and her own authority. The political alliance between Antony and Cleopatra worried Caesar\u2019s heir, Octavian, who, in 31 BCE, defeated the couple in a sea battle. Rather than suffer the humiliation of surrender, Cleopatra and Antony killed themselves.</p>\n<p>This coin was minted during Antony and Cleopatra\u2019s alliance. By pairing their faces on coinage, the rulers advertised their powerful partnership, which was so strong that Cleopatra\u2019s profile is an exact copy of Antony\u2019s portrait. Cleopatra\u2019s image appears on the front of the coin, which identifies her as the more important of the two rulers. A crown circling her carefully braided hair symbolizes her status as a queen.</p>\n",
