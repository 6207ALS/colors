    "description": "<p>Herakles was the consummate hero. Temples across Greece and South Italy were dedicated to him, the son of Zeus, and Romans, who knew him as Hercules, celebrated him as a role model. With brute force, determination, and just enough cleverness, Herakles completed his famous Twelve Labors to become immortal. Herakles is readily identifiable by his knobby club and lion\u2019s skin. The latter refers to his First Labor, in which he killed a magical beast who was ravaging the town of Nemea. The lion\u2019s invincible hide made him immune to weapons, so Herakles strangled him and took his pelt. Depictions of Herakles\u2019s other Labors can be seen throughout the galleries.</p>\n<p>Herakles can be identified on the back (reverse) of this coin by his attributes, the knobby club and the lion\u2019s skin. The front (obverse) of this coin depicts the head of the god Dionysos, facing right, crowned with an ivy wreath.</p>\n",
