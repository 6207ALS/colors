    "description": "<p>Correspondence, artwork, financial papers, printed material, photography, ephemera, and other documentation derived from the Isobel Neal Gallery. Neal, Chicago\u2019s first Black member of the Chicago Gallery Association, opened the Isobel Neal Gallery in 1986, with the intent to represent and sell works created exclusively by Black artists. The gallery was located at 200 W. Superior St and operated until 1996. The Gallery featured the work of artists including Elizabeth Catlett, Francisco Mora, William S. Carter, Benny Andrews, and more. In 1996, Neal retired, marking ten years that the gallery represented and exhibited art. However, Neal continues to serve as an arts consultant and curator in Chicago, and as Trustee Emeritus and a member of the Committee on Learning and Public Engagement at The Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/findingaids/search/searchterm/Neal,%20Isobel,%20Gallery%20Records/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
