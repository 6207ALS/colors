Our guided on-site experiences are led by educators who engage students in close looking, discussion, and critical thinking about works of art that span time, geography, and culture. Check out the options available for students at various grade levels. And note bilingual tours (Spanish and English) are available to support Spanish-speaking learners in your classrooms.
