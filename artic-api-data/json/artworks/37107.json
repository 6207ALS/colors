    "description": "<p>This tapestry evokes fifteenth- and sixteenth-century European art and design, even though it was made centuries later. Resplendent in a gown and sitting atop a powerful horse, the crowned figure proudly carries a falcon. The fashionable hunting scene is set in a simplified millefleur (thousand flowers) design. This combination was a popular tapestry style during the late medieval period.</p>\n<p>The pairing of the detail in the patterning of the dress with the angularity of the forms is typical of tapestries designed and made at the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u00f3 School of Weaving. The G\u00f6d\u00f6lI\u00f3 Workshops, which included the weaving school, were established in the early twentieth century just north of Budapest. There, artists designed and made a great variety of decorative arts objects in hopes of establishing a Hungarian national aesthetic. They incorporated medieval elements in their modern designs to demonstrate their country's strong and vibrant heritage.</p>\n",
