    "description": "<p>Paul Klee\u2019s artistic skills were diverse: he was a painter, printmaker, critic, and theoretician. He taught at the Bauhaus for most of the famed school\u2019s existence; initially head of the bookbinding department, he also supervised the glass-painting workshop. His greatest influence, however, was as a lecturer for the basic design course on the theory of form in art. In lectures, Klee developed his ideas about the &quot;polyphony&quot; of painting, which was based on his interest in simultaneous sensational effects that could be created by various layered formal elements. He believed that this type of creative experimentation could &quot;issue forth a transformed beholder of art&quot; and thus pave the way for total abstraction.</p>\n",
