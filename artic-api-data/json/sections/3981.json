(sight)  \nSigned: Henri- / Matisse (recto, lower right, in graphite); signed: Henri-Matisse (verso, lower right, in graphite)  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of the Gecht Family, 2015.263\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse established the forms in this portrait with his pencil then retraced and rearticulated the contours until arriving at their final positions. He employed parallel hatching to selectively shade and model the figure. To clarify shapes he erased some changes and redrew the final contours with a heavier, dark line. Erased marks can be found throughout, including in the proper left shoulder strap (see fig. 28.1). Matisse added final touches to the eyes, nose, and lips with the tip of a sharply pointed pencil (see fig. 28.2). On the verso, the artist sketched a model reading in graphite pencil, with no revisions (fig. 28.3).\n\nThere are discrete pinholes at each corner, perhaps from being pinned to the wall at some point. There are three holes across the top edge of the off-white wove sheet, as if created by a hole punch for storage in a binder.\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (recto, lower right, in graphite) (fig. 28.4); signed: Henri-Matisse (verso, lower right, in graphite) (fig. 28.5).\n\nGraphite with touches of erasing (recto); graphite (verso).\n\nThe support is thick, rough, off-white wove paper. The sheet is composed of uniform, white fibers. The drawing on the recto corresponds with the felt side of the sheet. All edges are straight cut. The drawing has not been trimmed as graphite extends over the edges. There are three holes along the top edge, 0.2 cm in diameter, that appear to have been made with a hole punch (the left hole is 9.3 cm from the center hole and the right hole is 9.6 cm from the center hole). This may indicate Matisse drew on paper housed in a binder, similar to the one listed in a 1923 artists\u2019 supply catalogue and labeled \u201calbum \u00e0 dessin anglais avec anneaux\u201d (English drawing album with rings), which was available in a fine-grained, wove paper, size 36 \u00d7 26 cm, corresponding with this sheet (see fig. 28.6). As the catalogue explains, the rings permit the page to be turned over completely, which would have allowed Matisse to draw the composition on the verso in a landscape orientation, with ease.\n\n35.2 \u00d7 25.2 cm (13 3/4 \u00d7 10 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThe sheet edges have yellowed slightly. There is minor surface soil in the upper left. There is stray black wash in the upper right. There is what appears to be black pigment or paint residue on the edge of the paper at the upper right and left corners, which resembles the black wash in the upper right.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Family of the artist until 1978.\n\nSold to Lumley Cazalet Limited, London, on Jan. 25, 1978\u2013June 13, 1978.\n\nSold to Allan Frumkin (July 5, 1926\u2013Dec. 9, 2002), Allan Frumkin Gallery, New York, June 13, 1978\u20131979.\n\nSold to Dr. Martin L.
