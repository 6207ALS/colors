However, as the inscription indicates, this rare drawing was a gift from the artist to a certain \u201cMademoiselle Herminie,\u201d and it survived as a result. Rousseau often used flowers in his work for their symbolic meanings. He was particularly fond of daisies, which traditionally represent innocence and purity. Perhaps a more heartfelt message was intended here, as the petals of daisies are often plucked, one by one, to find out if one is loved: \u201cshe loves me, she loves me not.\u201d</p>\n",
