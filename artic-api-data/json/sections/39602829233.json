Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of several working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nThis print is among those printed in an early phase of compositional development. Gauguin usually printed his proof impressions on one of three types of pink paper or on tan wove paper, all of inferior quality, and all found in early-state impressions. For this second-state impression, he used one of these pink papers.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 58.1.2).\n\nGauguin printed the block twice to create this impression. Brown ink was used first, applied unevenly in a very thin layer. It is a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow or chrome orange. The black ink printed on top of the brown ink layer combines the same pigments with carbon black. Color applied sparingly with a brush includes vermilion and a mixture of cobalt blue and cadmium yellow to make green (fig. 58.1.3). Touches of black ink were used sparingly adjacent to the proper right arm of the female figure (fig. 58.1.4).\n\nThe smooth, lightweight, pale-pink wove paper has faded to tan; a very faint pink tone remains barely discernible. The paper is a poor-quality, Western, machine-made sheet. The paper fibers are distributed evenly, and the paper is uniform in color. There are no inclusions or colored fibers present. A fine mesh pattern is visible in transmitted light, and in raking light one side of the sheet appears glossy while the other has a matte surface. This pattern is unrelated to the pattern of fine diagonal lines visible on the surface of the print (see Compositional Development).\n\nGauguin used this paper to print a number of early-state impressions. He printed on both the glossy side and the matte side, seemingly indiscriminately. In this impression of Te faruru (Here We Make Love) the glossy side of the sheet appears on the recto. The Art Institute\u2019s second-state impression of Te atua (The God) (cat. 53.3) and a first-state impression of Noa Noa (Fragrant) in a private collection were both printed on this type of paper; again the glossy side appears on the recto in both. Yet in the Art Institute\u2019s third-state impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56.2), the recto has a matte appearance. The paper used for this impression was previously misidentified as papier satin\u00e9, a type of paper that was commonly burnished on both sides. The papers, also known as casing papers, were thin brown or pale-buff papers used for packaging and labels. It is likely that Gauguin\u2019s chosen papers were used for the same purpose.\n\nFor the verso of this sheet, see fig. 58.1.1.\n\n356 \u00d7 202 mm (image), 359 \u00d7206 mm (sheet)\n\nGauguin printed the block twice, skewing it ever so slightly in a double printing so that the underlying brown printing is discernible in the figures, in areas where the black ink was applied thinly, and elsewhere only when viewed under magnification (fig. 58.1.5). The artist inked the block first with a very thin, uneven layer of brown that he wiped away, thereby \u201cdrawing\u201d the embracing figures. He then laid a cloth down onto the surface of the block to remove excess ink, in the process imparting a twill impression in the brown ink layer that is visible only in the figures (fig. 58.1.6); its presence elsewhere is obscured by black ink. Gauguin transferred the twill impression by placing a woven material over the inked block and rubbing it to selectively remove some of the ink as the material was lifted from the block. The texture of the weave imparted a pattern of regularly spaced diagonal striations running from upper right to lower left overall, similar in appearance to the twill pattern found in canvases, cloth, and in this case, perhaps the rag the artist used to wipe ink from the block.\n\nThe second time Gauguin inked the block, he used black ink that he wiped extensively through the center so that the underlying composition he created in the brown ink layer would remain visible (fig. 58.1.7). He rolled out more black ink behind the figures to create a denser black tone (fig. 58.1.8), while elsewhere he applied it very unevenly so that the underlying paper and brown ink tones are revealed. After printing, the artist brushed vermilion over the inks to partially tone the male figure\u2019s garment (fig. 58.1.9). To his right, touches of green watercolor, which now appear gray against the darkened paper, were meant to soften the appearance of the curved lines behind him (fig. 58.1.10). Touches of silvery-gray media cast the horizontal strokes to his left into shadow (fig. 58.1.11). The head and bent arm of the female figure are barely discernible, with only the softest touch used to remove ink in order to articulate the right side of her thrown-back head.\n\nIn 1988 the print was treated locally to mend tears and fill losses in the upper left and right corners.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication, treatment was undertaken that improved the tone of the paper. A great deal of discoloration was removed during the course of treatment, making the sheet less brittle.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa nNoa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF and Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nE.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
