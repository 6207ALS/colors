Advantageous in terms of climate and location, F\u00e9camp offered cliffs, jetties, shingle beaches, and a harbor town as subjects. In August 1868, Monet had rented a hotel room in F\u00e9camp for his family and in early September had moved to a rental home. Of the three vertical canvases he painted that summer, two show large sailing ships left stranded by the low tide (e.g., fig. 18.2 [W118]) and are very similar in subject and composition to the two canvases of docked boats executed thirteen years later during a second trip there. Indeed, the compositional elements of the 1868 paintings\u2014sandy beach, a large ship with a prominent anchor, and intricate and finely painted masts tipped to one side\u2014are nearly identical to those of the slightly larger canvases from 1881, the Art Institute painting and Boats Lying at Low Tide at the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum (fig. 18.3 [W644]). Compared with the 1881 compositions, however, the 1868 canvas at the Kunstmuseum Winterthur (fig. 18.2) is moody, with an exaggerated gray tone and a heavy sky. Apart from the red-gold anchor, which drops from the bow and echoes the strip of flag at left and the horizontal stripe on the fragment of a boat hull at far right (fig. 18.4 [W118]), Monet used nearly monochromatic tones for all the harbor elements, employing thick buttery strokes for both the vessel and its surroundings. In the earlier depictions of boats on the beach, Monet\u2019s focus was clearly on the ships. In each of these works there is just a hint of the buildings in the background, whereas in the views of 1881, the patchwork of pink and blue structures plays a prominent role in setting a mood and providing a colorful backdrop for the vessels.\n\nThe translation of the title of the Chicago painting, Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp, lacks the drama and metaphorical significance of the French title, Bateaux \u00e9chou\u00e9s \u00e0 F\u00e9camp: the adjective \u201c\u00e9chou\u00e9s\u201d can mean \u201cfailed,\u201d \u201caborted,\u201d and \u201cunsuccessful,\u201d or in a nautical sense, \u201cstranded,\u201d \u201caground,\u201d or more literally, \u201cbeached.\u201d Popularized by Dutch marine artists in the seventeenth century, the theme of the beached boat was redeployed in the nineteenth century by Romantic and Realist painters, notably Eug\u00e8ne Isabey and Jules N\u00f6el. These painters intensified their pictures of ships in harbors or beached on shores by including figures for narrative effect (e.g., fig. 18.5) or featuring stormy seas or dramatic sunsets in the background. Closely attuned to Monet\u2019s vantage point is a photograph of ships in harbor by Louis-Alphonse Davanne (fig. 18.6), which features ships looming in the foreground, framed on the right by a pier and boat and, beyond the water on the other edge of the harbor, the uniform blocks of the town\u2019s architecture.\n\nWhat distinguishes these works by Monet from treatments of beached boats by earlier artists and contemporary harbor views by his nearer contemporaries Eug\u00e8ne Boudin and Johan Barthold Jongkind (e.g., fig. 18.7) is the way these seemingly stable compositions are subtly destabilized. In the 1868 painting and both 1881 versions, the careening boat takes center stage with a complicated movement of shifting masts, bowsprits, and rigging. This is quite at odds with the boxlike architecture of the buildings in the background. Monet\u2019s choice of format is also unusual within the tradition of harbor scenes. Instead of the standard marine (by definition, a horizontal), Monet used the portrait, or vertical format, which emphasizes the ship\u2019s towering form and challenges the anticipated frame of reference for the subject.\n\nOn March 9, Monet arrived at F\u00e9camp, leaving his sons with his companion, Alice Hosch\u00e9d\u00e9, and her family at their home in V\u00e9theuil. The artist intended this return trip to the region to last three weeks, but he remained four weeks longer than anticipated, staying with M. Lemarrois on the Grand Quai (fig. 18.8) and on occasion traveling to Petites-Dalles to visit his brother L\u00e9on. From the beginning Monet was optimistic about what he would do there, as he reported to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel:\n\nI leave tomorrow for F\u00e9camp, where I will make a few seascapes [marines]. As soon as I return\u2014that is in three weeks\u2014 I will come to Paris and will bring you the paintings that I need to deliver to you, and at the same time show you what I will have made at the sea.\n\nAs the art historian Robert Herbert pointed out, this was an exceedingly productive visit, encouraged and prolonged by the additional funds advanced by Durand-Ruel. In the course of this month Monet painted twenty canvases, including views of the water from the surrounding cliffs at F\u00e9camp and nearby Grainval (e.g., fig. 18.9 [W660]). For both Boats Lying at Low Tide and its related composition at the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum (fig. 18.3 [W644]), Monet placed himself on the shingle beach looking toward the village across the harbor. In the Tokyo version, the ship is turned, profiling the large keel: normally underwater, the keel is now unsettlingly at rest on dry land. Monet\u2019s vantage point was farther away for the Chicago composition, and the ship is foreshortened and seen more straight on. Monet\u2019s inclusion of the hull of a boat at right startles\u2014while it is not the focus of the painting, its leftward slant echoes that of the larger ship, framing the composition in a seemingly random but highly calculated manner. The prominent F on the port side of the bow links the work to another 1868 composition, Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp (1868; private collection [W117]), in which a ship careening helplessly on the sandy shore bears the marking F662 on the hull.\n\nIn both 1881 versions, squiggly figures painted wet-on-wet suggest dockhands or shipmen. These figures surround the boat in the Chicago canvas; they hold pole-like objects and appear to be applying caulk, or more likely, removing barnacles and other parasites before the vessel returns to sea (fig. 18.10). Infrared and X-ray imaging reveal what appears to be an earlier, horizontally orientated composition, which means that Monet rotated the canvas ninety degrees for the final, vertical composition. When he abandoned his earlier idea for the present composition, he did not completely scrape down and paint over the original surface. The presence of an underlying composition is most visible in the upper right corner, where traces of blues, ochers, and pinks from another painting show through (fig. 18.11). The sky itself is thinly applied, and touches of light brown from the ground layer are visible in broad areas, indicating that the original composition was not completely painted in but rather drawn in to indicate the basic contours of the landscape or seascape (fig. 18.12). The presence of agitated strokes on the right center to right side, which can be discerned in the X-ray (fig. 18.13), may suggest that these were rocks or even crashing waves. Other paintings completed by the artist that spring, such as The Sea at F\u00e9camp (fig. 18.9 [W660]), included these compositional elements and palette.\n\nThe dealer Durand-Ruel almost immediately bought up the canvases from Monet\u2019s March\u2013April visit to F\u00e9camp and Petites-Dalles, establishing what Charles Stuckey refers to as \u201ca regularly executed exclusive option\u201d on the artist\u2019s production. The following spring, in 1882, the Art Institute\u2019s Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp was selected by Durand-Ruel as one of thirty-five works to be included in the seventh Impressionist exhibition. Monet wrote to his dealer prior to the opening that he was not convinced it could take place, given that he was unable to be sufficiently involved. Two weeks later Monet expressed further concern about showing his work without having the opportunity to see the other works selected and how they were hung. The F\u00e9camp pictures were Monet\u2019s first recommendation for what Durand-Ruel should choose to include:\n\nNonetheless and preferably, choose from the paintings that I made in F\u00e9camp. And then [choose from those showing] the ice effects, poppies, fields of wheat, some still lifes, and for the catalogue, put titles that are vague (landscape, seascape) in order to change [them] as needed.\n\nThese instructions reveal that it was Monet\u2019s suggestion to provide \u201cvague\u201d titles, thus providing the organizers the flexibility to switch out paintings as necessary. Judging by his correspondence with Durand-Ruel, it is likely that Monet was able to see and select the final works to be included in the exhibition. The Chicago painting was originally exhibited without the qualifier F\u00e9camp in the title. From its first public appearance, a year after it was executed, it retained its more descriptive title, whether the singular Bateau \u00e9chou\u00e9, as it was titled in 1882, or more frequently, when it was shown in several exhibitions at the Durand-Ruel gallery in New York, Bateaux Echou\u00e9s (see Exhibition History).\n\nAt the seventh Impressionist exhibition the Art Institute\u2019s painting was shown with at least three other canvases depicting the view from the cliffs at F\u00e9camp. The critic Nivelle complimented the pictures of cliff views, singling out the Chicago painting as showing \u201ca schooner resting on its flank at low tide with a distant view of the city, seen behind the masts and rigging [agr\u00e8s].\u201d\n\nMonet would remember F\u00e9camp as a positive experience when compared to the \u201chorrible\u201d Poissy and Dieppe. Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp and, indeed, the works from the 1881 visit in general remain little published in the Monet literature. Part of this reflects the fact that the canvases have remained largely in private hands. When Robert Herbert published his book on Monet in Normandy, for example, he included a black-and-white reproduction of Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp (as Ships Careened in the Harbor of F\u00e9camp). Painted after Monet\u2019s long involvement with the views around Argenteuil and the Seine, both the Chicago and Tokyo (fig. 18.3) canvases represent in some way a nostalgic return to a subject he had experimented with years before. But with these 1881 paintings, he introduced the heightened color and inventive, textural brushwork that would mark his works of the later 1880s. The Chicago painting in particular is deceptively simple in terms of traditional subject matter, but it bears all the hallmarks of Boats on the Beach at \u00c9tretat (cat. 22), painted three years later at the popular beach resort town \u00c9tretat, where the caloges, or shells of decommissioned boats, offer a counterweight to the otherwise pink-blue sand of the beach and buildings.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp is painted on a pre-primed, no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. The ground consists of a highly pigmented, light-brown layer that appears to be quite thin. Technical imaging revealed underlying forms unrelated to the final composition, suggesting that a different composition, likely a horizontal format, was initially painted on the canvas. The earlier composition appears to be an outdoor scene, probably a seascape or landscape. It appears to have been broadly scraped down before the final picture was started, but paint from the first composition remains visible to the naked eye, especially in areas of the right side of the sky, which was very thinly painted. Traces of black particles observed microscopically throughout the painting seem to be related to underdrawing for the final composition as they appear to correspond to elements of that composition, particularly the masts and rigging of the central boat. The final composition appears to have been relatively rapidly executed, consisting largely of an open buildup of wet-on-wet brushstrokes that allows patches of the light-brown ground, as well as small areas of paint from the earlier composition, to show through.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 18.14).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 81 (lower right corner, in dark-red paint) (fig. 18.15, fig. 18.16). The signature and date are very thinly applied and appear abraded in some places. The painting was dry when the signature was applied.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe current dimensions correspond closely to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (81 \u00d7 65 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 16.0V (0.6) \u00d7 14.1H (0.5) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThere is mild cusping on all four sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the aqueous lining (see Conservation History). Tacks spaced 2\u20134 cm apart. The X-ray shows a second set of tacks underneath the original tacking margins that attaches the edges of the lining canvas to the stretcher; the lining canvas has been trimmed so as not to extend beyond the original tacking edges, but is exposed in a few places (fig. 18.17). Other holes are more recent and appear to be related to something having been screwed into the edges of the stretcher.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tacks spaced approximately 2\u20136 cm apart. It appears that several of the original tack holes were reused when the canvas was restretched after lining. Other holes appear to have been crudely filled with a thick, off-white material. Cusping in the canvas corresponds to the placement of the original tack holes.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher may be original to the painting. It is six membered, including a vertical and a horizontal crossbar, with mortise and tenon joints and twelve keys. Dimensions: Stretcher-bar width, 6.3 cm; stretcher-bar depth, 2.0 cm; crossbar width, 6.2 cm; crossbar depth, 1.5 cm (fig. 18.18).\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed canvas, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground appears to consist of a single layer (fig. 18.19).\n\nLight brown. Dark-brown and possibly red pigment particles visible microscopically (fig. 18.20, fig. 18.21).\n\nXRF analysis indicates that the ground contains lead white with calcium compounds and iron oxides including burnt umber, and traces of zinc white and barium sulfate. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR); however, concentrated areas of black particles\u2014possibly charcoal based on their appearance\u2014were observed microscopically underneath and between the paint layers in several places (fig. 18.22), suggesting that the particles are associated with underdrawing related to the final composition. Very faint lines of the black material closely correspond to the painted lines of the masts and rigging of the central ship, indicating that these lines were lightly drawn in prior to the application of the paint (fig. 18.23). Black particles were also observed in many places underneath the buildings and the boat in the lower right corner. In one area, a visible line conforms somewhat to the side of this boat and appears to continue underneath the edge of it (fig. 18.24).\n\nNot analyzed.\n\nWhere sufficient material was present to discern actual drawing lines, these lines appear to correspond closely to elements of the final composition.\n\nClose observation of the painting surface reveals several areas of colorful brushwork underneath the sky that are unrelated to the final composition. The technical images confirm that a different composition was initially painted on the canvas. X-ray and infrared images show a dominant vertical feature in the right side of the sky (fig. 18.25) that seems to suggest that the earlier composition was painted with the canvas rotated 90 degrees clockwise. With the canvas turned on its side, the dominant vertical feature\u2014now oriented horizontally\u2014is positioned approximately one-third of the way up from the bottom edge and appears to represent a horizon line or shoreline (fig. 18.26). The long, rather straight brushstrokes associated with this feature, which are visible in the X-ray and infrared images, appear to be associated with a thin, light-green paint (fig. 18.27, fig. 18.28). With the canvas still rotated horizontally, the X-ray shows undulating brushwork in what is now the lower left corner that seems to be related to the presumed horizon or shore line (possibly rough waves or rocks). On the right side of this \u201clandscape\u201d orientation are two specific forms visible in the X-ray and infrared images\u2014one near the center and one near the \u201cright\u201d edge\u2014that appear to represent rocks or other landscape features (fig. 18.29). In both areas, colorful paint is exposed at the surface where it was only partially covered by the sky in the final composition (fig. 18.30, fig. 18.31). Green, brown, yellow, and dark-blue paint can be discerned, although the paint appears to be very thin and abraded, possibly having been scraped or wiped away before the final composition was begun (fig. 18.32). The earliest paint layer in the sky on the left half of the final (vertical) painting could also be from the first composition. It is very thin, with exposed ground throughout. The strokes are mainly vertically oriented and seem to trail off the top edge of the canvas. There are long continuous strokes running parallel to the left edge (fig. 18.33); they seem to be oriented in a way that would be expected if the canvas was painted in a horizontal orientation.\n\nOther elements that appear to have been part of the earlier composition include some roughly vertical strokes in the foreground water, visible in the X-ray and raking-light images; the orientation of these strokes runs counter to the general buildup of the foreground, which was painted using mostly horizontal strokes (fig. 18.34). Drying cracks in the dark-brown paint of the hull of the central boat reveal white and light-blue paint that could be related to sky or water from the underlying composition (fig. 18.35). Thin, broken layers of bluish-gray and greenish-gray paint are visible underneath the small sailboat and the buildings behind it (fig. 18.36). These gray layers are probably part of the original composition and appear to have been scraped down (fig. 18.37). The fact that so much of the light-brown ground layer remains exposed throughout the painting, especially in the sky (fig. 18.38)\u2014where elements of the first composition are most evident\u2014seems to indicate that either the earlier composition was not very advanced, and remained sketchy around the periphery, or, as mentioned above, that the earlier composition was broadly scraped away or otherwise abraded before the final painting was begun. In the lower left quadrant of the X-ray, some long, fine scratches are visible that could be evidence of scraping with a rigid tool (fig. 18.39). In addition, there are numerous areas throughout the painting where the ground, exposed through breaks in the brushwork of the final composition, is abraded, exposing the peaks of the canvas threads (fig. 18.40).\n\nThe final composition is openly painted, leaving exposed at the surface areas of ground, as well as some of the brushwork from the earlier composition. The painting appears to have been relatively rapidly executed with much of the brushwork applied wet-on-wet. The buildup of the sky consists of strokes in a variety of shades ranging from pale gray to dark gray, applied in random orientations, mostly wet-on-wet (fig. 18.41). The buildings, water, and foreground consist largely of individual strokes and touches applied wet-on-wet using a variety of colors. The artist used longer, horizontal strokes to denote the water in the middle distance, whereas the foreground was painted using shorter strokes and touches applied in different orientations. Multiple colors were often picked up on the brush without mixing (fig. 18.42). The rigging of the central boat was painted with a dry brush lightly dragged across the surface. The lines were pulled wet-in-wet through one another where they intersect (fig. 18.43) and through the thicker impasted strokes of the sky when they were still wet (fig. 18.44). The five small figures positioned around the central boat were painted wet-in-wet over the background, using a few deft strokes of the brush (fig. 18.45, fig. 18.46).\n\nThere is a band of disturbed paint at approximately 2.5 cm from the bottom edge where something was pressed against the wet surface (fig. 18.47, fig. 18.48), possibly from an easel or traveling crate used when the painting was still wet. There is also some flattened paint around the edges that appears to have been caused by framing when the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes including 0.3\u20130.5 and 1 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nXRF analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, chrome yellow, iron oxides including burnt umber, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and bone black. When the painting surface was examined under UV, several light-pink brushstrokes exhibited a pinkish fluorescence, suggesting the use of red lake; microscopic examination of the painting surface suggests that another deep-red, nonfluorescing lake was also used.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an even, slightly glossy surface coating (synthetic resin estimated). There are residues of yellowed natural-resin varnish in the interstices of the brushwork.\n\nThere are no records of previous conservation treatment on file. The painting has been lined with an aqueous adhesive. The original stretcher appears to have been retained. The tacking margins have been trimmed and tacked to the stretcher independent of the original tacking edges. There are many small flake losses, mainly at the edges and corners that have previously been consolidated, filled, and retouched, probably in more than one campaign. The presence of yellowed natural-resin residues in the recesses of the paint texture indicates that the work was cleaned at least once prior to the application of the current synthetic varnish.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. The painting is lined with an aqueous adhesive and appears to retain its original stretcher. The canvas is somewhat slack and has an overall convex bulge. Abrasion of paint and ground layers throughout the work appears to be part of the artist\u2019s working process, probably related to scraping down of the earlier composition. There are numerous small flake losses, down to the canvas; these are concentrated mainly near the edges and corners. Some areas appear to have been consolidated with a wax-based adhesive that has discolored. Several of these losses have been filled and retouched; some of the retouching is poorly matched to the original paint. There are localized areas of drying cracks in dark areas including the hull of the central boat, the sailboat, and parts of the buildings. There are fine mechanical cracks scattered throughout the paint layer that are mostly visible only under magnification. Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer. The painting has a somewhat glossy varnish layer, and there are residues of yellowed natural-resin varnish in the recesses of the paint texture. There are a few tiny accretions scattered over the surface, including wax residues from past consolidation and paint splatters.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nThe current frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, mid-to-late-twentieth-century, stylized reproduction of an Italian, seventeenth-century, Carlo Maratta, scotia frame with a leaf-and-tongue sight molding (APF Inc., New York). The frame is water gilded over red-brown bole on gesso. The gilding is selectively burnished and heavily rubbed and toned. A final whitish-raw umber tone was washed over the frame and flecked overall in white. The carved basswood molding is mitered and nailed, and a pine back frame was nailed and glued to the moldings. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is ovolo with carved egg-and-flower ornament; scotia side; convex; torus with carved ribbon-and-reel ornament; scotia; ogee with carved leaf-and-tongue ornament (fig. 18.49).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 1881.\n\nAcquired by M.

Herbert, Monet on the Normandy Coast: Tourism and Painting, 1867\u20131886 (Yale University Press, 1994), p. 39, fig. 40. Herbert assesses the F\u00e9camp canvases as \u201cwhat we might expect from a young artist desirous of making a name as a painter of landscape.\u201d\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis of the signature area, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains lead white, vermilion, red lake, and cobalt blue; other pigments may also be present. See Federica Pozzi and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Fecamp\\_222491\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 1, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, Inge Fiedler, \"222491\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\" May 23, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of factors such as lining, restretching, and keying out of the stretcher over time.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Boats Lying at Low Tide at F\u00e9camp (W645),\u201d May 2014.\n\nThe construction, patina, and labels suggest that this stretcher may have been original or was added early in the painting\u2019s history.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including aqueous lining.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon, aluminum, and phosphorus. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Fecamp\\_222491\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 1, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
