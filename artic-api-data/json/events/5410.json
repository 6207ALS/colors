    "description": "<p>Artist Cameron Rowland (American, born 1988) creates work that centers on the material operations of racial capitalism that order everyday life. Rowland\u2019s work relies on a materialist approach to the conditions of production that structure both institutions of subjection as well as their refusal. The work is grounded in a critique of property, and the capacity for art to function as a medium of this critique.</p><p>Join Rowland for a virtual talk on this work, followed by a conversation between the artist and Richard Birkett, a curator and writer based in Glasgow, UK. </p><p>Presented by the Society for Contemporary Art in partnership with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Visiting Artists Program</p>",
