    "description": "<p>A clever, charmingly quirky portrayal of painter Jackson Pollock \u2013 and the first in a series of picture-book biographies of contemporary artists</p><p>Jackson Pollock was unlike any other painter. Instead of sitting in front of an easel with brushes, he poured paint over canvases rolled-out across the floor, moving, splashing, and making the vivid liquid run with energy and rhythm. Pollock\u2019s story is told here with wit and eccentricity, perfectly paired with black-line illustrations \u2013 and splatters galore. Fausto Gilberti brings movement, life, and whimsy to the true life story of one of the most important contemporary artists of our time.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.5 x 8.5 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 48</li><li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 40</li><li><strong>Ages 4-7</strong></li></ul>",
