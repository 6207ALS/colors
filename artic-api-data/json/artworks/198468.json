Inscriptions identify the three figures. The bearded man at left is named Leon and was from Halai (located northwest of Athens). He clasps hands with Demagora, who sits before him and is presumably his wife. Their daughter, Helike, stands behind her mother and watches the couple bid an eternal farewell, although it is unclear which of the three has died. Only prominent families would have had the means to immortalize their loved ones by having their names set in stone.</p>\n",
