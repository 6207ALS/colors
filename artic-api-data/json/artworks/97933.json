    "description": "<p>During World War I, after several years of inactivity because of bad health and grief over the death of his second wife, Claude Monet embarked on a period of intense work. Building a large studio and improving his garden, he began a group of monumental paintings of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFPs_cRRGdM&feature=youtu.be\">water lilies</a> that he would later offer to the French state. Alongside this project, he painted a suite of 19 smaller canvases, including the present one. There is evidence\u2014including a few photographs of the artist working in his garden\u2014that Monet conceived these paintings outdoors and then reworked them in his studio. By this last stage of his career, however, the distinction between observation and memory in his work is intangible, and perhaps even irrelevant.</p>\n",
