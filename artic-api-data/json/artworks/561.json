The boy in the foreground, mimicking the adults, strums a cello with a pipe and breaks a string, a subtle allusion to the perils of unbridled passion. Jan Steen, one of the Dutch Republic\u2019s most prolific comic painters, crafted his scenes upon the contemporary notion that comedy mirrors everyday life.</p>\n",
