By the time of Hadrian\u2019s death, Antoninus had taken over most of the duties of governing, yet at the beginning of his reign (A.D. 138\u201361), Antoninus saw strong senatorial opposition to his insistence that the Senate deify Hadrian (with whom the Senate had had some serious clashes). Coinage during this earliest period was influenced by this tension, with all titles and honors that Antoninus inherited from Hadrian being omitted from the issues. It was not until he threatened to abdicate that the Senate gave in, granting his request as well as the cognomen Pius and the honor of pater patriae. Antoninus accepted his fourth and final consulship in 145, after which date all his coins bear the legend COS IIII.\n\nThe image of Roma on the reverse is unusual. Typically Roma is depicted holding a little Victory in her outstretched hand. Instead, here she carries the Palladium: in myth, a statue of Athena that had protected the city of Troy until it was stolen by Diomedes and Odysseus during the Trojan War. The sacred statue was, depending on the legend, brought to Rome either by Diomedes or by Aeneas, when he founded the Eternal City. However it got there, the Romans firmly believed the original statue to be preserved in the temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum, and along with Vesta\u2019s fire, it was an essential and potent protector of Rome. The year A.D. 153 marked the nine hundredth anniversary of Rome, and many monuments and coins\u2014including this one\u2014were created in anticipation of that important event.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">RIC III 147: Roma holds Victory, not the Palladium.\n\nLucius Verus (r.

Though the Senate had accepted him as the new emperor, titles granted to him under Hadrian\u2019s rule would have been annulled: Yarrow, \u201cAntonine Coinage,\u201d p. 430; Hill, Dating and Arrangement, pp. 78\u201389. The title Pius referred, among other things, to Antoninus\u2019s expression of filial duty toward Hadrian: see cat. 32, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Pompey the Great.\n\nBy Diomedes, according to Vergil, Aeneid 2.162\u201379; by Aeneas, according to Dionysus of Halicarnassus, 1.67\u201369. Ovid agreed that the Palladium was in the temple but does not indicate how it got there: Tristia 3.1.29.\n\nYarrow, \u201cAntonine Coinage,\u201d p. 441.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 53 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Antoninus Pius, A.D. 145/61\n\n</section>",
