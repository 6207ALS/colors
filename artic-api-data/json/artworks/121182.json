Text facing the etchings describes the production, a few years earlier, of the lithographs<em> Fifth Stone</em> (1963) and <em>Sixth Stone</em> (1964).</p>\n<p>The text is by the young poet Tony Towle, who had recently arrived at U.L.A.E. as secretary in 1964 and wrote an account of watching Bontecou make the lithographs <em>Fifth Stone</em> and <em>Sixth Stone</em>. In response, she created several etchings reminiscent of the lithographs. The fact that Bontecou decided to produce etchings that evoke the spirit of the original lithographs is part of the book\u2019s eccentricity.</p>\n<p>This work is part of the significant holdings in the U.L.A.E. archive owned by the Art Institute that documents the gestation of <em>Fifth Stone, Sixth Stone</em>.  In all, the archive includes etching plates; preparatory and transfer drawings; working, trial, and artist\u2019s proofs; as well as a prototype for the box that would contain the book.</p>\n",
