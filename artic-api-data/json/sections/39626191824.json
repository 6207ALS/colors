Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThis is one of four in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints that depict Tahitian subjects. The other three are Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Women, Animals, and Foliage (cat. 97), and Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil (cat. 99). These thematically related works can stand on their own, but when placed end to end, they can also be read as a frieze-like arrangement (see fig. 98.1). Gauguin left no instructions as to how to display the prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after his death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \u201c House of Pleasure\u201d in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThe present print features a hooded man bearing fruit crops on a pole carried over his shoulders and steadied on each side by his hands. At his left stands a cow; moving along before him, at his right, is a scruffy-looking dog. The scene is framed on the left and right by tree trunks, on the top by foliage, and on the bottom by a ground line. Gauguin\u2019s initials, PG, are located beneath the tree at the left; in the far-left corner of the second state, the artist reserved a space in which to number the impression (cat. 98.2 is inscribed \u201c 7\u201d in pen and ink [see Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks]). Entwined with the tree at the right is a female figure.\n\nWhile the title conventionally ascribed to the composition describes the central figure as a banana carrier, this does not seem quite the case. The objects hanging from the right side of his pole resemble coconuts or breadfruit more than bananas. The form hanging from the left side of the pole looks like the flower of the type of banana tree called Musa mei\u2019a rather than its fruit. Furthermore, if indeed it is a banana flower, it does not correspond to the variety known in Tahitian as fe\u2019i (Musa troglodytarum), the fruit of which is cooked before eating (see fig. 98.2 and fig. 98.3).\n\nThe standing cow at left harks back to Gauguin\u2019s early years as an aspiring artist, when he was on good terms with Gustave Arosa, who was named guardian of Gauguin and his sister after their mother\u2019s death. Gauguin\u2019s model for the cow is found in a painting by the French artist Octave Tassaert that had belonged to Arosa (fig. 98.4). Gauguin retained the illustrated sales catalogue of Arosa\u2019s collection (which was sold in Paris in February 1878) and appropriated elements from various examples in subsequent works of art, such as the cow in the present wood-block print.\n\nThe central figure derives from one of the visual documents that Gauguin took with him to Polynesia, images that nourished his artistic appetite. This was a photographic detail of the Column of Trajan (fig. 98.5) from a publication illustrated with images of a plaster cast made of the column in the early 1860s. The photograph involves another link with Gauguin\u2019s former guardian. The plates in the five-volume book were printed using a process invented by Arosa, which he called \u201cphototypie\u201d (collotype).\n\nThe armored soldiers striding up the column served Gauguin first as models for his 1896 oil painting Scene from Tahitian Life (fig. 98.6 [left, W 537]). Subsequent to informing the figure in the present wood-block print, the Roman relief was a source for figures in a woodcarving entitled La guerre et la paix (War and Peace) from 1901 (fig. 98.7 [left, Gray 127]), as well as a number of traced and transferred monotypes (fig. 98.8 [Field 1973 105], fig. 98.9 [Field 1973 96], fig. 98.10 [Field 1973, 49], and fig. 98.11 [Field 1973, 107]). Gauguin repeated the banana carrier motif in a simplified woodcut version for the February 1900 issue of his satirical broadsheet Le sourire (The Smile) (fig. 98.12 [Kornfeld 63 A]).\n\nThe animal walking in front of the carrier can be identified as a dog by comparing it to canines found in a number of related works by the artist (see, for example, fig. 98.6 left, fig. 98.8, and fig. 98.11).\n\nThe naked female entwined with the trunk of an unidentifiable tree at the right brings to mind the myth of Apollo and Daphne. The chaste Daphne spurns Apollo\u2019s amorous intentions, and she flees. She is saved by morphing into a laurel tree through the intervention of her father, the river god Peneus. Daphne\u2019s arms turn into branches, her hair into leaves, her skin into bark, and her body takes root. The still-smitten Apollo promises always to protect her. Gauguin\u2019s figure is based on a standing nude in his 1899 oil painting Te tiai na oe ite rata (Are You Waiting for a Letter?) (fig. 98.13 [left, [W 587]).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.

Poussin interpreted this season with a reference to the biblical story of Israeli spies, sent by the nationless Jews after their expulsion from Egypt, to Canaan, who return with harvest bounty, proof of the abundance of the promised land.
