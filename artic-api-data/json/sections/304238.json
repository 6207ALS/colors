In these drawings Whistler continued to experiment with the stump on fine-grained transfer paper. Here he used it to suggest the soft play of shadows and the effect of light filtering through the trees. The artist considered offering this image to D. C. Thomson for publication in The Art Journal in December 1893 (letter 71, letter 72, and letter 73). However, he suspected on the basis of earlier warnings from his printers that the delicate stump work might not survive the retransfer to additional stones necessitated by a large periodical edition. Eventually, in February 1894, he drew another image of the Luxembourg Gardens (cat. 81) expressly for The Art Journal.\n\nAt least twenty-six impressions of Conversation under the Statue, Luxembourg Gardens were printed during the artist\u2019s lifetime, considerably more than T. R. Way\u2019s (1905) figure of fifteen.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 193 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (311 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (294 \u00d7 200 mm), signed.
