    "description": "<p>The 360\u00b0 Chair rethinks the standard office chair. Neither a stool nor a chair, it was inspired by the different seating positions that Grcic\u2019s studio assistants assumed during a day. The quirky design consists of a crossbar on which one can sit, perch, or lean, with a low backrest for support. It is meant for activities that require one to move and take up a variety of positions during the workday, rather than for long stints in front of the computer. Grcic envisioned the 360\u00b0 Chair being used in the studios of designers and architects, as well as in salons or<br>barbershops. Its five-star metal base with casters indicates its function, and a footrest at the base is marked like a compass, illustrating the chair\u2019s ability to spin 360 degrees, as its name suggests. The 360\u00b0 family of furniture also includes a high stool, a table, and a mobile storage unit.</p>\n",
