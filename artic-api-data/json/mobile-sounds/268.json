    "transcript": "<p>LINDSAY MICAN MORGAN: A30. Georgia double parlor, circa 1850.</p>\n<p>The Georgian double parlor is one of the few rooms that\u2019s partially based on fiction, but it\u2019s a fiction that was also based on some fact. A \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d room.</p>\n<p>RM WOLFF: In Mrs. Thorne\u2019s personal effects, there was a copy of \u201cHouse and Garden,\u201d which is still a magazine that exists, but an American magazine about interior decorating that had still images from the film in it, including still images of the parlor, that were in Mrs. Thorne\u2019s folder on the Georgie double parlor. So we know that this is what she was looking at while she was building the rooms.</p>\n<p>LINDSAY MICAN MORGAN: There\u2019s exact replicas, you know, of some of the objects seen within the movie that then Mrs. Thorne added to her Georgian double parlor. The most easily identifiable objects are the large gold, ornate mirror over the fireplace mantel as well as the detailing over the windows above the drapery.</p>\n<p>RM WOLFF: Why she would chose, in this one instance, to go to something that had been in such a popular way depicted-- yeah, it is a little bit of a curiosity. I mean, imagine the delight at visiting the Thorne rooms. You know, \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d has just won Best Director, Best Picture and Best Actress-- to go to the Thorne rooms, which have finally arrived in your town and to see Scarlet O\u2019Hara\u2019s parlor. That\u2019s being very invested in your audience at the time.</p>\n<p>SCARLET: I\u2019ll go home. And I\u2019ll think of some way to get in there. After all, tomorrow is another day!</p>\n<p>LINDSAY MICAN MORGAN: Mrs. Thorne re-created such a scene as Scarlet O\u2019Hara would be comfortable in.</p>\n",
