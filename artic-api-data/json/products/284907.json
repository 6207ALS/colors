    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Tote developed from Claude Monet\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Houses of Parliament, London</em>, 1900-01 from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">During his&nbsp;London&nbsp;campaigns, Claude Monet painted the Houses of Parliament in the late afternoon and at sunset from a terrace at Saint Thomas\u2019s Hospital. This viewpoint was close to that of the English artist&nbsp;J. M. W. Turner&nbsp;in his visionary paintings of the fire that had destroyed much of the old Parliament complex in 1834. In his response to the poetry of dusk and mist, however, Monet was actually inspired by the work of a more recent painter of the Thames, the American James McNeill Whistler.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Made specifically for the Monet in Chicago exhibit. <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">&nbsp;</em>Celebrating the paintings Monet did of cityscapes.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 16 x 14 in.
