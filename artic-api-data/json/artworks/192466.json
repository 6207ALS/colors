    "description": "<p>Christina Ramberg exhibited in False Image exhibitions along with Roger Brown and Philip Hanson, to whom she was married. Her early student fascination with composing images in rows may have been inspired by Suellen Rocca\u2019s interest in repeating patterns culled from commercial and industrial catalogues, as well as cheesy newspaper advertisements. Eventually, Ramberg\u2019s image making settled on disturbing depictions of women who are cropped and sometimes bound, though often humorously coiffed or draped. She was chair of the Painting Department at SAIC for several years and served as a role model to innumerable women who studied at SAIC during her tenure.</p>\n",
