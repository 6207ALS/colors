The traces of at least three other pieces of fruit (presumably oranges) at lower left bear witness to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s changing opinion as he struggled to make the composition work.</p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 5.75 x 8.5 in.</li><li><strong>60 unlined pages.</strong></li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Premium 80# Vellum Finish Paper.</li></ul>",
