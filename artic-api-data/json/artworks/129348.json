The poet and narrator, Dante, has already encountered many extraordinary things in the tormenting circles of purgatory and hell, where some of his deceased friends now reside. In this scene, Dante appears at the left with his lamented muse, Beatrice (they are labeled \u201cD\u201d and \u201cB\u201d). She has escorted him to meet his great-great-grandfather, who teaches him about his family origins and the Florence of his lifetime (depicted below). All the souls in heaven appear as blameless infants floating around the main figures.</p>\n",
