Adding both exotic and domestic plantings, including his famous water lilies, the artist created the garden that would be one of his principal subjects for the rest of his life. <em>Water Lily Pond</em> was among the 18 similar versions of the motif that he made in 1899\u20131900; their common theme was the mingling of the lilies with reflections of other vegetation on the pool\u2019s surface.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;10.375 x 11.25 in.</li><li><strong>Full Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp; 16 x 16 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Premium cardstock.</li></ul>",
