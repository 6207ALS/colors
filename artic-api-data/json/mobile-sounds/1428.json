    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This storage jar with two handles is called an amphora from the Greek words meaning to carry with both. Mary Greuel spoke in the gallery about the painted scene on this amphora.</p>\n<p>MARY GREUEL:  Greek iconography is all about being able to see the accouterments and the things that the figures are holding and what they\u2019re wearing and what kind of situations are depicted. So in this case we\u2019re able to see Heracles. We know him as the hero. And he is often represented with Athena who is seen on the right. She is the goddess of war.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The figure on the right painted white is Athena. She wears a plumed helmet and holds a warrior\u2019s shield with a rooster in its center. In front of her, we see Heracles killing the Nemean lion, the first of his mythic twelve labors.</p>\n<p>MARY GREUEL:  On Greek vases the figures are depicted in either a black or a red. At certain periods they did use additional colors and this face preserves some of the white paint which was added on to the face. The figures of the two women are painted white. This is a convention of showing women with white skin. There is also additional color which is overlaid which is sort of a purple brown and you can see it in some of the cases of the figures, the use of hair, the use on the female garb.</p>\n",
