    "short_description": "In 1999, internationally recognized Italian architect Renzo Piano was commissioned to design the Art Institute's new north wing. Piano's plan, which makes imaginative use of natural light and blends of new architectural forms into an established urban fabric, has inspired this exhibition that not only provides a foretaste of the new addition but also evokes the stimulating environment of the Renzo Piano Building Workshop, where the architect's singular visions take shape.",
