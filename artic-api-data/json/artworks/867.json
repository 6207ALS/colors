    "description": "<p>The versatile Flemish painter David Teniers turned to military paraphernalia as the subject of his still lifes in the mid-1640s, as the long conflict of the Thirty Years\u2019 War was drawing to a close. Here soldiers play cards in the dim interior of a guardhouse, while a page carries the officers\u2019 cloaks. However, the chief subject of the work is the pile of discarded armor, weaponry, and parade gear\u2014a saddle, musket, powder horn, charging spanner, and gauntlets\u2014in the immediate foreground. In treating armor as a still-life subject, Teniers followed the precedent of Jan Breughel the Elder, whose daughter he had married.</p>\n",
