    "description": "<p>A behind-the-scenes look at the extraordinary and meticulous design of graphic objects for film sets.\u00a0 Although graphic props such as invitations, letters, tickets, and packaging are rarely seen close-up by a cinema audience, they are designed in painstaking detail. Dublin-based designer Annie Atkins invites readers into the creative process behind her intricately designed, rigorously researched, and visually stunning graphic props. These objects may be given just a fleeting moment of screen time, but their authenticity is vital and their role is crucial: to nudge both the actors on set and the audience just that much further into the fictional world of the film.</p><p>Paperback</p><p>208 pages</p><p>10 in. x 7 1/2 in.</p>",
