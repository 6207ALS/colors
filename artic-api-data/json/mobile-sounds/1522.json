    "transcript": "<p>&quot;Narrator:  The shapes of these vessels are simple but graceful at the same time, the colors are muted and quiet. These features were typical of the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1890s. Look at the tall green vase at the back, it was made at the Rookwood studios, America's foremost art pottery at the end of the 19th century. Rookwood was founded in 1880 in Cincinnati, by Maria Longworth Nichols. She and her colleague, Mary Louise McLaughlin, developed techniques of painting and glazing that resulted in vessels like the one you see here. The Arts and Crafts movement placed a lot of emphasis on a straightforward, some said &quot;truthful,&quot; approach to materials, and valued handcrafted objects over machine produced goods. The movement attracted reformers and thinkers of both sexes, and some of the most innovative potters were women.&quot;</p>\n",
