    "description": "<p>While Chicago and its architectural community are known for having invented the skyscraper, this building typology has expanded around the world. The Infinity Tower is a residential structure designed for the Dubai Marina in United Arab Emirates. Upon its completion in 2013 it will be a welcome addition to the historical lexicon of the skyscraper and the world\u2019s tallest 90-degree spiral building. The building will soar 73 stories, topping out at 1,004 feet, and be constructed with high-strength, cast-in-place concrete columns. The building\u2019s rotated form reflects the structural framework; the identical floor plates turn just 1.2 degrees around the building\u2019s central core, completing a full 90-degree twist from the bottom to the top. Wimer\u2019s spiraling tower is emblematic of a generation of younger designers who are committed to furthering the structural innovation of tall buildings.</p>\n",
