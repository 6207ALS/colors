    "copy": " Barbara Kruger is known for works that provocatively integrate photographs and text. Her art reveals and challenges the ways in which images used in the commercial media often perpetuate stereotypes, objectify women, and encourage conformity. This teaching packet includes an essay, discussion questions, activity ideas, a glossary, and an image of the artwork. ",
