    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Poster developed from Gustave Caillebotte\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Paris Street, Rainy Day,</em>&nbsp;1877, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">This complex intersection, just minutes away from the Saint-Lazare train station, represents in microcosm the changing urban milieu of late nineteenth-century Paris. Gustave Caillebotte grew up near this district when it was a relatively unsettled hill with narrow, crooked streets. Caillebotte strikingly captured a vast, stark modernity, complete with life-size figures strolling in the foreground and wearing the latest fashions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 26 x 32 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Material:</strong> Premium Cardstock</li>\n</ul>",
