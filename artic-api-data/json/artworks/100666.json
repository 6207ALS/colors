    "description": "<p>By 1963, architect Bruce Graham of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill developed designs for the Brunswick Building (now the Cook Country Administrative Building), including a monumental work for the plaza just west of the structure. He commissioned Joan Mir\u00f3, known for his abstract paintings and sculptures composed of biomorphic shapes, to produce a monument that would complement Pablo Picasso's planned sculpture for the new civic center (now Richard J. Daley Center) across the street.</p> \n<p>After visiting Chicago to survey the site and designs for the building, Mir\u00f3 made this plaster maquette as a proposal. The commission was delayed, however, for nearly two decades, until 1980, when Mayor Jane Byrne launched new efforts to realize Mir\u00f3's design: a 40-foot-tall female figure with outstretched arms made of bronze, ceramic tiles, and cement. <em>Mir\u00f3's Chicago</em> was completed and dedicated on the artist's 88th birthday, April 20, 1981.</p>\n",
