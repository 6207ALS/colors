    "description": "<p>Art Shay is one of Chicago\u2019s great photojournalists. With more than 25,000 published photographs\u2014including more than 1,000 magazine covers\u2014Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.</p>\n<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs\u2014of an American military air disaster\u2014were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay\u2019s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.</p>\n<p>Of particular significance in Shay\u2019s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909\u20131981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city\u2019s down-and-out, and the photographer\u2019s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.<br>\u2014 Permanent collection label</p>\n<p>\u201cCamera atop the eye or under my coat, I followed my best friend through the purlieus of \u201chis Chicago\u201d for around nine years. Nelson Algren, Chicago\u2019s earthiest writer, felt that he himself was one of these sad people\u2014in the same way Dickens and Dostoevsky had done before him. The Human Comedy indeed. And the center of the comedy for Algren and me and my hidden camera was often this impromptu courtroom at the police headquarters at 11th and State. There the minor dramas of little lives that scraped against the law were adjudicated. \u201cWasn\u2019t you here a few months ago for annoying a little girl, Sam?\u201d said the lieutenant. \u201cNo, your honor,\u201d came the outraged reply, \u201cI was here for molesting a little boy.\u201d \u201cNinety days\u201d said his honor, \u201cand if I see you here again it\u2019ll be ten years!\u201d\u2019<br>\u2014Art Shay</p>\n",
