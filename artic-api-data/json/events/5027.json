    "description": "<p>Curator and chair of Photography and Media Matthew Witkovsky joins Thomas&nbsp;Struth, renowned German photographer, and Janice Guy, British-born photographer turned pioneering New York gallerist, for a conversation on their life and work.</p><p>Janice Guy and Thomas Struth's professional and creative paths have been intertwined since the 1970s. Struth helped preserve Guy\u2019s photographs when she turned from art studies in D\u00fcsseldorf to gallery work in Naples; Guy in turn introduced Struth to museums, people, and places that would prompt important work. The two close friends will discuss aspects of art arising from these personal intersections together with curator Matthew Witkovsky, a long-standing acquaintance of both artists.&nbsp;</p><p>The annual Hugh Edwards Lecture in Photography honors the memory of Hugh Edwards, curator of photography from 1959 to 1970. A tribute to Edwards\u2019s tremendous dedication and achievements during his time at the Art Institute, this annual lecture has been established to bring internationally renowned practitioners in photography to as broad an audience as possible. The lecture is free and open to the public.</p><p>The Hugh Edward Lecture series is supported by the Crossed Purposes Foundation Fund.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
