The image shows a cluster of tombstones and the backs of the seventeenth-century buildings of Cloth Fair. The pieces of cloth hanging from the upper windows of one of the buildings may have been the products of the looms within, since this was an area where weavers and cloth merchants still lived and worked in the nineteenth century. Whistler chose a frontal view, concentrating on the juxtaposition of the various rectangles that divide the facades of the buildings. The image is a variation of the shopfront theme that was one of his favorite subjects for etchings, small oils, and watercolors during the 1880s.\n\nA late-nineteenth-century photograph of the site taken from a slightly different vantage point (fig. 21b) demonstrates how accurately Whistler recorded the details that interested him: the old windows and doorways with their brickwork and faceted surfaces, the tombstones listing with age, and the patterns of light and shadow that played across the courtyard. However, a comparison between the photograph and the lithograph suggests that Whistler compressed the facade of the main building, bringing windows and doorways closer together than they were in reality. A graphite drawing (fig. 21a [M 1144]) in a small sketchbook that Whistler used in the East End in 1887 provides a much more accurate translation of the architectural elements recorded in the photograph. Using a narrow, vertical format for the lithograph, Whistler heightened the picturesque value of the scene in a way that would perhaps have been of less concern in the pages of his personal sketchbook.\n\nAccording to T. R. Way\u2019s catalogue, only twelve impressions were pulled from this stone. Eleven were still in the artist\u2019s estate when it was inventoried in 1903, suggesting not only that there was no demand for the lithograph, but that little effort had been expended on marketing or advertising it. Churchyardwas not shown in the 1895\u201396 exhibition at the Fine Art Society, although the two other St. Bartholomew lithographs were included.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (312 \u00d7 208 mm).
