It is one of seven images (cat. 119, cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, and cat. 125) that Whistler drew on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal and sent to the Ways for processing on 27 September 1895 (letter 141). Six of these first Lyme Regis drawings depict the same smithy. In The Smith\u2019s Yard one of the Govier sons and a young apprentice pause from shoeing horses to gaze out toward the artist. With a few concise lines Whistler suggested the rustic character of the yard, framed on the left by a large rain barrel and on the right by a grinding wheel. A comparison of the lithograph to a contemporary photograph showing Samuel Govier at work in almost the same spot (fig. 124a) underscores the accurate yet selective nature of the artist\u2019s approach.\n\nThe drawing for The Smith\u2019s Yard transferred more successfully to stone than most of the other images made on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal in Lyme Regis, perhaps because portions of the image were more heavily worked with crayon. It seems to have been one of Whistler\u2019s favorite Lyme Regis lithographs, for he included it in the exhibition of his lithographs at the Fine Art Society that opened in mid-December 1895, and instructed the Ways to print twenty impressions in anticipation of sales. The sales records from the exhibition indicate that three impressions were sold at four guineas each (app. III.1). Since the prices, which were set by the artist, ranged from two to four guineas, The Smith\u2019s Yard was priced at the high end. It was the only Lyme Regis subject to be priced at four guineas on the original price list (app. V.1).\n\nThere is no record of the negotiations between Whistler and The Studio regarding the publication of The Smith\u2019s Yard in the February 1897 issue of the periodical. The artist severed his ties with the Ways soon after his wife\u2019s death in the spring of 1896, but his lithographic stones remained in the possession of the printers until August 1897. If, as seems likely, the periodical edition of The Smith\u2019s Yard was printed by the Ways after the break with Whistler, the arrangements were probably handled by the artist\u2019s solicitor, William Webb.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 227 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (331 \u00d7 209 mm), signed.

Impressions published in The Studio (47, no. 10 [15 February 1897]) and The International Studio (1, no. 1 [15 March 1897]) were machine printed from supplementary stones on medium-weight, ivory wove paper, which in some cases has discolored to cream or tan. There is a deckle edge running along the right edge of the sheet. Many impressions from the periodical edition have been trimmed to remove the blind stamp. Studio impressions are characterized by minor losses in the image and by a grainy quality in the lines.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove paper (296 \u00d7 208 mm), with blind stamp, rebound.
