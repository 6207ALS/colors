    "description": "<p>Some years ago, Sculptor Vasa Velizar Mihich developed methods of sculpting with cast acrylic forms. Perfecting his technique over time, the artist has created a stunning, vibrant vocabulary all his own. Be sure to observe from every angle. Vasa and his team create each piece by hand in Los Angeles CA. Signed by the artist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 13px; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Arial'; font-style: normal; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;\" data-mce-style=\"font-size: 13px; color: #000000; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; font-family: 'Arial'; font-style: normal; text-decoration-skip-ink: none;\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\">3.5 x 1.25 x 6.5 in.</span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">*Please note that due to the handmade nature, each product may vary in design/look/appearance.</em></p>",
