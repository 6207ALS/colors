In January 27 B.C., the Senate voted Octavian Caesar two titles that changed the face of government in Rome: Princeps (the first head) and Augustus (the revered one). Princeps gives us a designation for this period of Roman history, the Principate, as well as the origin of our word prince. Augustus became Octavian\u2019s legal and preferred cognomen. Added to his adoptive father\u2019s name, Caesar, it gave him a new way to present himself to the world, as he does on this coin. Both Caesar and Augustus would continue to be used as titles for future emperors for as long as Rome survived.\n\nAmong the other honors the Senate granted Octavian at the same time was the right to wear the civic oak wreath (corona civica). This was traditionally awarded to a citizen who had saved the life of another Roman on the battlefield; Octavian, they decreed, had saved all Roman citizens by his victory at Actium. Images of Augustus with the oak wreath were typical on coin issues from Rome and Spain. The left-facing portrait reminds us that die-cutters could work from either side of the \u201cofficial\u201d sculpted portrait of Augustus, crowned with the oak wreath. This portrait type survives today in more than 150 extant examples, as well as on the magnificent Gemma Augustea (fig. 35.1).\n\nThe comet on the reverse, with the inscription \u201cdivine Julius,\u201d refers to the apotheosis of Octavian\u2019s adoptive father. Julius Caesar had been deified by vote of the Senate on January 1, 42 B.C., an action that the Roman populace believed was confirmed by the appearance for seven days of a comet over Rome during Caesar\u2019s funeral games two years later. Stars had been associated with Julius Caesar even during his lifetime, evidently due to Caesar\u2019s ancestry through Venus, the evening star (fig. 35.2); and were subsequently used on coins of the triumvirs to declare their caesarian allegiance. This coin is the earliest appearance of a \u201chairy star\u201d (sidus crinitum), or comet, perhaps referring directly to the \u201crenewal of interest in the nature, origin, and future of Augustus\u2019s reign.\u201d\n\nTaken individually, these titles and images are all traditional, even conservative. But taken together, the associations hinted at divinity: even the civic crown was a reminder of the tree sacred to Jupiter, who often wore an oak wreath.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">BMCRE I, p. lxiv; also see Zanker, Power of Images, p. 93.\n\nThe \u201cofficial\u201d portrait is represented by the Augustus Bevilacqua bust in the Glyptothek M\u00fcnchen, Munich, acc. no. 317.\n\nJohn T.
