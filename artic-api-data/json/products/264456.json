    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Print developed from Claude Monet\u2019s <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Cliff Walk at Pourville,</em>&nbsp;1882, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. &nbsp;In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass\u2014composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes\u2014appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women\u2019s wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5 x 4.5 in.</li><li><strong>Full Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp; 8 x 10 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Premium cardstock.</li></ul>",
