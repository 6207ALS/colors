    "description": "<p>Tour the MacLean Collection of Asian Art and Antique Maps. In the Map Library, enjoy Barry MacLean's incredible collection of globes, maps, astrolabes, and various mapping paraphernalia. The collection ranges from a 1300 BC clay tablet mapping the Babylonian city of Nippur to the current Sloan Digital Sky Survey's ongoing mapping of the galaxies. A pocket globe and pocket astrolabe, a gadget once brandished by wealthy Englishmen seeking the time of day through a map of the stars, are just two highlights from this collection.</p><p>In addition, tour the Larry Booth\u2013designed contemporary building constructed specifically for MacLean to house his collection of Asian art. While the architecture of the building alone is worth the trip, the collection is truly outstanding. Docents in each of the buildings will lead you on guided tours. </p><p><strong>Schedule of the Day</strong></p><p><strong>9:30\u2014</strong>Meet at Adler Park to arrange carpools</p><p><strong>10:00\u2014</strong>Half of the group arrives at the Asian art building, and the other arrives at the Map Library</p><p><strong>12:00\u2014</strong>Meet at Blufish in Vernon Hills for lunch</p><p><strong>1:30\u2014</strong>Take the other half of the tour to complete the experience</p><p><strong>3:00\u2014</strong>Drive back to Adler Park</p><p><strong>Registration Period:</strong> April 14, 2019\u2013May 2, 2019</p>",
