This sheet of studies was preparatory for his painting <em>Saint Bartholomew</em> (1740/45; private collection, Rome). It was part of a series of canvases representing Christ\u2019s apostles commissioned by Count Cesare Merenda, Batoni\u2019s most dedicated patron, for his gallery in the town of Forl\u00ec in central Italy\u2014the Art Institute owns the <em><a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/11575\">Saint Andrew</a></em> oil. The presence of squaring in red chalk suggests the studies on this sheet were ready to be transferred to the canvas.</p>\n",
