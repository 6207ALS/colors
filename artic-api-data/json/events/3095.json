A relentless innovator always pushing the traditional boundaries of art, Oiticica moved rapidly and radically from early works influenced by European modernism to large-scale installations that were meant to be physically experienced and often to critique political and social issues. <br><br>*Museum admission is free for Illinois residents every Thursday, 5:00\u20138:00\u2014including during this event. </p><p>Sponsored by</p>",
