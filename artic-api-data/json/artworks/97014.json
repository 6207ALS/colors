    "description": "<p>Between 1967 and 1969, Bontecou created a group of large flower sculptures made of vacuum-formed plastic whose centers trail long tendrils and which resemble gas masks. She envisioned these to be the products of a post-apocalyptic world, commenting that \u201cI was doing a lot of drawings of flowers prior to [the sculptures]. And I thought, \u2018this is all we\u2019re going to have left. Make a few plastic flowers in the world and that will be it. Give them a few [gas] masks, let them survive.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>With <em>Tenth Stone</em>, Bontecou experimented with several subtle colors, but settled on a simple black for the final, published print. The flower\u2019s petals and stem are riveted like metal, merging the botanical and the mechanical to create a disturbing hybrid that reflects, among other things, Bontecou\u2019s fears for the environment.</p>\n",
