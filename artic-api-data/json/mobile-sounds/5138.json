    "transcript": "<p>The man I live with is the most beautiful thing I know. Even though he could be a few inches taller. I\u2019ve never come across absolute perfection. I prefer well-built men. It\u2019s a question of size and shape. Facial features don\u2019t mean much to me. What pleases me aesthetically is a man\u2019s body, slim and muscular.<br>\u2014<br>Image Description:<br>The portrait shows a light-skinned woman with short, curly hair. She wears a pair of dark, wide sunglasses, a light-colored sweater, and a delicate necklace.</p>\n<p>In the image of beauty, a light-skinned man lies on his right side facing away from the camera in an unmade bed. His head and torso dominate the foreground on the right as he leans back on his elbows, and his body extends to the left on a diagonal, moving away from the camera. He wears only red, white, and blue floral patterned shorts or underwear. Light enters the space from the right and only pieces of his body catch the light: his back, his hip, his heel. His back muscles are clearly visible. His head and legs are completely in shadow. His short, dark, curly hair blends into the darkness in the top right corner. Off-white sheets bunch around his back and lie wrinkled along the left side. Just beyond his legs, a blue and white striped garment, perhaps a dress, lies on the bed.</p>\n",
