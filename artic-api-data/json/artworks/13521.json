    "description": "<p>St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 is today considered one of France\u2019s most important poets of the second half of the nineteenth century. Although he was known for the obscure imagery and difficult syntax of his verse, Mallarm\u00e9 enjoyed the friendship of other modern thinkers, in particular, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist artists such as \u00c9douard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Odilon Redon, Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, and James McNeill Whistler. Despite the fact that much of his poetry is unabashedly extreme and difficult to decipher, artists continue, to this day, to turn to his evocative verse for inspiration.</p>\n<p>Edvard Munch met Mallarm\u00e9 during a trip to Paris in 1896\u201397, and he became a regular guest at Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s Tuesday night soirees, where he mingled with other visionaries of the day such as August Strindberg and Vincent van Gogh. In this portrait, Munch depicted the poet as a disembodied head, floating almost mystically. The use of green ink recalls the faded green accouterments of Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s study. Of this portrait Munch said, \u201cI drew him in half-shadow which matched his character.\u201d Though it is not known whether this was a commissioned portrait, it might have been intended for the frontispiece of an edition of the complete works of Mallarm\u00e9, published in 1897. The project ultimately failed because Munch worked too slowly. Regardless of that disappointment, Mallarm\u00e9 was pleased with the final print and described it as a \u201cgripping portrait, which gives me an intimate sense of myself.\u201d</p>\n",
