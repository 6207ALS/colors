The bold style and sharp wit of his drawings attracted a wide following, and his illustrations were also published in book form. This caricature of Wilde and Whistler was reproduced in <em>Phil May\u2019s Sketch-book</em>, which was first issued in 1895. The caption refers to Whistler\u2019s repeated assertions that Wilde plagiarized his ideas, accusations that ended their guardedly amicable relationship in 1890.</p>\n",
