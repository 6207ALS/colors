Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques as seen in this third\u2014and final\u2011state impression. After satisfactorily arriving at a final composition on each of the ten blocks, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color using more customary oil-based media, as well as some that contained beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 53.4.2).\n\nFour different layers of media are present in this print. Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from another source, traditionally called a tone block, but instead it is likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass in this instance. The printing ink in this layer has a rather fluid appearance and was applied to specific localized areas on the block. The second layer of oil-based media combines chrome yellow; vermilion; emerald green; and orange (a mixture of chrome yellow and vermilion) (see fig. 53.4.3). It was applied to specific areas directly on the paper by means of transfer from the glass. However, this layer of medium has a thick, caked appearance indicative of the wax and resin it contains. Atop these two layers of colored media, the block was printed twice, first in an iron oxide\u2013containing printing ink that is likely yellow ocher, then in black printing ink that is a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue.\n\nThe paper is a good-quality, medium-weight Japanese paper that has a uniform distribution of long paper fibers that are visible under magnification and in transmitted light. The sheet was trimmed slightly into the image area on all sides. It appears to have a laminar structure as a result of paper manufacture, and is not of the type that the artist would make himself by adhering two pieces of Japanese paper together. The paper surface is smooth and hard sized, making it robust enough to withstand the artist\u2019s media-transfer and printing methods.\n\n203 \u00d7 351 mm (image/sheet)\n\nThis impression of Te atua (The God) evolved through a series of four stages. The media were applied in several layers. The first layer of media applied to the paper was chrome yellow, and it was applied overall by means of transfer from a tone block, used to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper, or another wood block; however, it is more likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. The medium appears to have been applied in a semifluid consistency. Its even appearance and uniform dispersion onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. Very strikingly, the moon that illuminates the couple to the left remains devoid of the bright yellow that covers the majority of the sheet. Here, the creamy tone of the Japanese paper backlights the couple, and the hard irregular lines of demarcation around the forms are indicative of the use of a frisket to isolate the area (fig. 53.4.4). Elsewhere, application of the yellow printing ink was site dependent, with a thicker layer applied to some areas and a thinner layer to others. To achieve this degree of specificity it is likely that Gauguin did not ink up a wood block for this purpose. Instead, to assure that the yellow medium was accurately placed where intended, it is again likely that a piece of glass was used so that he could see where he wished to place the ink. By positioning the glass over the block, Gauguin could accurately locate the yellow in the areas in which he wanted it to appear.\n\nOnce the sheet of glass, acting as a tone block, was printed, a second layer of media was applied to it. Microscopic examination makes clear that residual yellow ink that did not transfer to the paper remained on the glass, and a second layer of media was applied directly on top of it in anticipation of a second transfer. In this second layer of media, a golden yellow predominates, with much lesser amounts of orange present as well (fig. 53.4.5). Here, minute particles of transferred media sit on the surface of the paper atop the more-fluid yellow layer below. The dimensionality of the medium is pronounced in raking light. Examination under magnification and gentle probing with a needle reveal that the medium has a waxy consistency, and indeed the oil-based medium was found to contain some beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin).\n\nIt is possible that Gauguin took advantage of the properties of the wax-and-resin-containing medium by applying it to the glass while warm and then allowing it to cool and partially harden before transferring it to paper. When Gauguin placed the sheet of paper that now carried the yellow tone back on top of the glass and rubbed it, he transferred seemingly randomly dispersed islands of encrusted media throughout the sheet. However, careful examination reveals that there is a denser application of the medium in the center of the composition. The absence of this waxy medium, on the most part, from the arched passages to the left and right of the central figure is clearly intentional and is evidence that glass was used not only as a support to carry the media but as a means to achieve site specificity.\n\nEmerald-green oil-based media, applied with a stencil, were used to color the small tree on the left and the palm frond on the right. Solvent was added to modify their working properties. Under magnification, peaks of media are visible; they formed as the paper was lifted from the glass during transfer (fig. 53.4.6). On the verso, staining from the solvent-diluted media is visible, and may be a result of the solubility of some of the oil from the paint and its absorption into the paper (fig. 53.4.1). At center, two strokes of red, applied to the glass with a dry brush, were transferred to the left and right of the central figure\u2019s torso (fig. 53.4.7).\n\nAfter applying the second layer of media, Gauguin positioned the sheet on top of the wood block, which he had inked in yellow ocher printing ink and pulled an impression from. Following this, he reinked the block with black, and deliberately repositioned the paper askew of the ocher impression (fig. 53.4.8). The double printing of the block adds resonance to the composition.\n\nUltimately, to print this impression of Te atua Gauguin worked in a deliberate manner to lay out zones of color, leaving only the visual end result of the mechanical transfer of the media to chance. The artist\u2019s approach was deliberate; his materials and their application were well thought-out to achieve the desired tonal and textural variations evident in the work. What at first glance appears to be a spontaneously executed production is instead a well-considered methodology borne of an assessment of the materials, their diverse mechanical properties, and their distinctive appearance when transferred onto a paper surface.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication the print underwent conservation treatment to reduce discoloration. When this was removed from the sheet, its tone brightened significantly and the colors now appear more vibrant. Comparison with watercolor passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape (Women at the River) [cat. 59.2]) and especially within Gauguin\u2019s manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with an ivory hue rather than a golden tone (fig. 53.4.9).\n\nThe print is in excellent condition. There are soft vertical undulations across the sheet. There are a series of tight creases associated with the printing in the upper right, lower right, and lower left. There is a small loss located 5 mm in from the right edge and 80 mm down from the top edge that was formed by a grazing insect who also grazed into the image to the left of this area causing an irregular surface abrasion. There is a 10 cm horizontal, linear abrasion through the center that is barely visible in raking light.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]) and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThis method of transfer was clearly the precursor to the watercolor and oil-transfer methods that Gauguin adopted moving forward (see, for example, cat. 68 and cat. 124).

Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIn many ways the carrier used to transfer media determines the visual qualities that are obtained once the media has been transferred onto a paper support. In this impression, because the bright-yellow medium appears to be of a semifluid consistency, it could not have been transferred from a paper carrier. The paper itself would have absorbed much more media than it would have released in the transfer process, and the resulting transfer would not have been as distinct and media rich.\n\nThis technique differs from that used to add the base tone to a similar impression of Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.3). In the Noa Noa impression, the artist used subtractive techniques to wipe the yellow ink from the glass, whereas here he applied the yellow medium, albeit unevenly, throughout, using a frisket to protect the single area that he wished to leave devoid of media.\n\nThe organic media in the paint were analyzed using THM-py-GCMS and found to be an oil-based medium, some with beeswax and Pinaceae resin present in varying amounts in different prints. This work was carried out by C\u00e9line Daher and is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, THM-py-GC analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThat Gauguin\u2019s methodology was deliberate rather than random is further illustrated by another third-state impression in the collection of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown, Mass. It is remarkably close to the Chicago impression, and to a great degree, Gauguin applied similar, if not identical, media in a similar sequence. Site-specificity of media application is identical. Gauguin did, however, include a final step in the making of the Clark impression by adding touches of black and ocher by hand with a dry brush in the faces of the couple to the left. This technique is identical to that used in an impression of Noa Noa (Fragrant) in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (cat. 51.3).\n\nMary Cropley, condition report, March 1988; Kristi Dahm, condition report, Aug. 2003; Harriet K.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

Te atua (The God) from the Noa Noa Suite appears in the inventories of Geiser (no. 86-106, Jan. 18, 1931, Holzschnitte, and no. 68-89, Dec. 24, 1931, as Gravures sur bois, all listed as a set of woodcuts).

The collection was purchased in Basel after Durrio failed to return the cash deposit on the works loaned for the 1928 exhibition.

Photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe works in the Paco Durrio, and later Walter Geiser, woodcuts in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago have inscriptions on the verso, which were deciphered as the order they were exhibited and presented in the catalogue for the 1906 Salon d\u2019automne at the Grand Palais des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. This print is inscribed with the number 1, the first print in the \u201cGravures sur bois\u201d section of the exhibition, which corresponds to entry no. 136, \u201cTe atua.\u201d\n\nThere are two editions of this exhibition catalogue. In the first edition, the exhibition dates are listed as July\u2013August 1928, and the Art Institute\u2019s print is given as cat. 102. See Kunsthalle Basel, Paul Gauguin, 1848\u20131903, exh. cat.

It is likely that this small element came loose from the block and its omission from subsequent impressions seemingly did not disturb Gauguin since he did not reinsert the fragment.\n\nCollector\u2019s stamp of Walther Geiser, Basel (not in Lugt).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 53.4 Te atua (The God), from the Noa Noa Suite, 1893/94.\n\nfig. 53.4.2 Gauguin\u2019s Te atua (The God) (1893/94).
