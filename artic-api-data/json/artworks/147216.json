(October 1993) / 1/7 Joel Sternfeld\"\n\n\n\nPolly Klaas was abducted from her home in Petaluma during a slumber party on October 1, 1993. Within hours, a massive volunteer effort was organized to find the twelve-year-old girl. Millions of flyers bearing Polly\u2019s photograph and a police composite sketch of her abductor were distributed nationally. Large banners were affixed to billboards across Northern California. \n\nTwo months later, Richard Allen Davis, an ex-convict with a history of drug and alcohol abuse, led police to a wooded area fifty miles north of Petaluma where he had buried Polly Klaas\u2019s body.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
