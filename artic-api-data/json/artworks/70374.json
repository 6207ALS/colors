    "description": "<p>This painting originally comprised the left-most portion of a much larger mural featured in the popular and salacious Dream of Venus pavilion, which Dal\u00ed created for the 1939 New York World\u2019s Fair. Incorporating the artist\u2019s major iconography of the decade, including a melting clock and a burning giraffe, the mural hung in the \u201cdry\u201d portion of the presentation. The adjacent \u201cwet\u201d aquarium featured a burlesque performance that complemented the pavilion\u2019s celebration of classical beauty. The arched passage in this painting was mirrored on the mural\u2019s right side in a panel that remains lost today.</p>\n",
