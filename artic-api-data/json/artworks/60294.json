    "description": "<p>After studying painting in Paris, Childe Hassam applied the techniques of French Impressionism to his views of American cities and landscapes. While he also painted coastal and pastoral scenes, Hassam often focused on urban areas such as his hometown of Boston, and New York City, where he lived after returning from Paris. Here the artist rendered New York with short brushstrokes that emphasize the movement and activity of everyday life on Fifth Avenue along Central Park. He incorporated vivid colors, such as the red and yellow of the woman's hat and skirt, into what would otherwise be a predominantly gray and white winter cityscape and captured the light in a natural manner, presenting a picturesque view of a modern metropolis.</p>\n",
