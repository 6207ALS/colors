In this scene of domestic life, Van Mieris deftly translated highlights on the cane bassinet and ceramic pitcher on the table with the tip of his brush. While painters like <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/25652/geraerd-ter-borch\">Gerard ter Borch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/35989/caspar-netscher\">Caspar Netscher</a> reserved this time-consuming style for rare and expensive textiles like silk, Van Mieris applied it to more commonplace materials.</p>\n",
