    "description": "<p>This drawing was not actually considered as a design proposal for the 1992 fair, but rather was part of a presentation Weese gave in 1977 to explain his ideas for a possible Chicago World's Fair in 1992.   Many influential Chicago businessmen and architects were invited to the meeting.  Three years later, inspired by Weese's presentation, a committee was formed to promote Chicago\u2019s candidacy to host the World's Fair of 1992.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Weese, the vision of the Chicago World's Fair-1992 Corporation differed greatly from his.  They desired a central site dominating Burnham Harbor, while Weese had envisioned an extended lakefront site from Navy Pier to Meigs Field, connected by a Skyride.  Weese later lobbied for this site, but to no avail.  Ironically, it was the Fair Corporation's (and later the Fair Authority's) unbending insistence that the fair be built in their vision that would ultimately lead to the Fair's demise in 1985.  The budding plans for the fair called for two cities hosting simultaneously: Chicago and Seville, Spain.  After Chicago was eliminated, Seville became\u2014and remained\u2014the sole host.</p>\n",
