    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">On half of this sheet, Saint Anthony\u2019s robe and a large fish extend from sheet 7E. At center appears a spiky, round, blue-tinged blowfish whose anthropomorphized face has tubular eyes and a downturned mouth. Below this sea creature are other human-crustacean-fish amalgams that allude to a primordial world evocative of Darwinian ideas about evolution, including a man with gill-like slits and a double-headed crab-lobster hybrid that continues into folio 7G/H. In the lower right corner, a spotted, amphibian-like creature reaches its webbed hand to touch Saint Anthony as it licks his robe with its long tongue. At upper right, blood from the boar in folio 6F/G flows onto the recumbent body of a naked woman. An artist\u2019s patch formerly covered the woman entirely, and watercolor additions applied to the patch transformed the figure into an open fish mouth.
