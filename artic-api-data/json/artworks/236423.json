    "description": "<p>Light House is a small temporary home that can be placed within an unfinished high-rise building in tropical cities. The unit was conceived as a solution to today\u2019s global housing crisis, which finds many workers unable to afford adequate accommodations in cities. The unit scheme can be installed quickly on a platform and covered with a roof, forming an urban living unit for the short to medium term. At nearly 14 square feet, the boxy microdwelling sits on a floor made of plastic-laminated plywood. Its frame consists of a polyethylene-coated metal grid, which also serves as interior shelving.</p>\n",
