This dating is suggested principally by the history of Afternoon Tea (cat. 173), which was printed by Auguste Clot in November for inclusion in Ambroise Vollard\u2019s second album of original prints, issued in December 1897. Three of these late lithographs (cat. 177, cat. 178, and cat. 179) are individual portraits of Frances Birnie Philip, Whistler\u2019s mother-in-law, seated in an armchair in the drawing room of the artist\u2019s home on the rue du Bac. Mrs. Philip is dressed in the mourning clothes that she wore after the death of her daughter Beatrix Whistler in May 1896. The three images, along with two other informal portrait sketches (cat. 175 and cat. 176) made at the same time, were clearly not intended for public distribution. They were printed in very few or even unique impressions, and examination of the proofs indicates that they were processed and printed together in an experimental manner. For example, one of the two known impressions of the present portrait, now in The Art Institute of Chicago (1927.5875), is printed on a sheet that bears on its verso another of Whistler\u2019s casual studies (cat. 176). Furthermore, it seems that Clot convinced Whistler to experiment with a new type of transfer paper, prepared by the printer himself and referred to in contemporary accounts as \u201c\u00e0 grain,\u201d for this image and for one other portrait of Mrs. Philip (cat. 177).\n\nInterestingly, each of the two known impressions of this portrait of Mrs. Philip is a different state. This suggests that Whistler was present when the drawings were processed at Clot\u2019s shop, and that he removed from the stone the faint sketch of a head visible in the first proof before having one additional impression pulled.\n\nThe faint outline of an upside-down head is visible below Mrs. Philip\u2019s skirt, and trial marks appear at lower right.\n\nChicago: MWC, ivory plate paper (252 \u00d7 169 mm).\n\nThe faint outline of a head and trial marks at lower right have been removed.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory plate paper (362 \u00d7 252 mm), signed (the other side bears an impression of cat. 176).  \nNesta R.
