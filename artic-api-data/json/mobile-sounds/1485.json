    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Lustrous dark glazes, like the one on this cup and cup stand of the eleventh century, mirror the glossy effect of lacquerware made in China at this time.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN: They\u2019re often referred to as black glazed ware but they\u2019re not pure black. This very dark color is created by a high proportion of iron in the glaze fired in a kiln that\u2019s rich in oxygen.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The small bowl gracefully sits on top of a stand designed as a smaller cup attached to a high footed saucer.<br>Elinor Pearlstein:  What\u2019s unusual about this piece is that the receptacle and the cup itself are so perfectly matched in glaze tonality indicating that the comprise one of the very few original sets that are preserved today. The cup and the cup stand would have been fired separately but probably in the same area of the same kiln.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: By this time, tea had become the subject of true connoisseurship.  Ways of preparing, presenting and serving the beverage were considered art forms by the well to do but only when transmitted to Japan did this practice become a true ritual what we recognize today as a tea ceremony.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN: I think people in the West associate tea with rather dark color. But at this time tea would have been made from leaves that were white that were then powdered and whipped so that the tea created the white foam around the edge. When the tea was drunk the aim was to keep that white foam around the edge of the cup. It was a bit of game.&quot;</p>\n",
