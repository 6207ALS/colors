The image is probably one of two drawings on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that the Ways transferred to stone and proved on 24 October 1895 (app. II.4); the other was The Little Steps, Lyme Regis (cat. 131). Sketch of a Blacksmith appears to be a variant of The Strong Arm (cat. 125) and The Blacksmith (cat. 127), both studies of Samuel Govier working at the furnace. Since these images were drawn in late September and early October, respectively, it seems likely that the present sketch was also created in October. The few transfer drawings Whistler is known to have made in Lyme Regis in November are primarily scenes of the streets and fairs of the town (cat. 131, cat. 133, cat. 134, and cat. 135), and he seems no longer to have been preoccupied with the blacksmith subject.\n\nAlthough the image failed to transfer successfully and the resulting impressions are uneven, Whistler never revised the image. After a very few proofs had been pulled, a partial, unrelated sketch below and to the left of the image was cleaned off the stone, presumably by the printers. T. R. Way omitted Sketch of a Blacksmith from his first catalogue (1896). When he added it to the second edition (1905), he apparently described one of these proofs pulled before the marks at lower left had been removed.\n\nIn his catalogue of 1905, T. R. Way described an impression of this lithograph in his family\u2019s collection as having \u201csome lines blacker in colour, probably the beginning of another sketch\u201d in the lower left corner of the image.\n\nWashington: FGA, ivory wove proofing paper (143 \u00d7 134 mm), inscribed verso, in Charles Lang Freer\u2019s hand, Gift from Thomas Way April 1906; NGA, ivory wove proofing paper (172 \u00d7 117 mm).\n\nThe upside-down profile sketched at the lower left of the composition has been removed.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory Japanese paper (255 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; MWC, cream Japanese paper (286 \u00d7 223 mm), signed. Washington: LC, cream Japanese paper (286 \u00d7 223 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Another second-state impression is found in New York, MMA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.

In that letter he expressed high hopes for the other image, The Little Steps, Lyme Regis (cat. 131), but he commented: \u201cThe other never mind much.\u201d This dismissive remark may suggest that the drawing was one on which he had lavished less time, or which he considered in some way experimental or unfinished. This study of a blacksmith, with its cursory handling and unrelated sketch in the lower left of the image, is a good candidate for identification as this \u201cother\u201d drawing.\n\nThe image has a textured appearance characteristic of many of the Lyme Regis lithographs; for a discussion of this effect, see cat. 121.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 130, second state.
