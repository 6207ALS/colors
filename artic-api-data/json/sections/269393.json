He frequently painted, drew, or etched modest shopfronts during his wanderings in London, Paris, and Dieppe. The subject of this transfer lithograph was located on Drury Lane in the neighborhood of the Covent Garden markets. As he often did in such compositions, Whistler animated the geometry of the shop facade with the quickly sketched figures of the proprietors standing in the doorway and children playing on the pavement. The image is probably one of five drawings (cat. 23, cat. 24, cat. 25, and cat. 27) listed in Way\u2019s invoice as having been transferred and proved on 8 June 1888 (app. II.3 and app. II.4).\n\nAlthough Drury Lane Rags exists in only one state, the artist apparently contemplated altering the image, judging from the existence of a touched proof in which the figure of the girl on the far right has been lightly worked over with crayon. He may also have considered printing this as a color lithograph at some point\u2014perhaps in 1890, when he produced the experimental Figure Study in Colors (cat. 39). This possibility is suggested by a hand-colored impression in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., which Whistler heightened with colored pencils, juxtaposing distinct areas of color much as he did in his pastels. Way (1905) listed fourteen impressions of this print, but, as is often the case, his count has proved to be too low.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), grayish ivory wove proofing paper (267 \u00d7 287 mm), signed; ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 207 mm); MWC, off-white laid paper (266 \u00d7 211 mm).
