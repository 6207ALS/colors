A.D. 198\u2013217), better known by the nickname Caracalla, began to be minted in 196 when he and his younger brother Geta were appointed Caesar by their father, Septimius Severus. In A.D. 211 Septimius Severus died, but the intended joint rule of the brothers ended with the murder of Geta by Caracalla that same year, after which Caracalla reigned as sole Augustus. Caracalla\u2019s reign was tough on civilians but supportive of the military, who saw its pay increase by half. The legend on the reverse of the coin styles Caracalla as pontifex maximus, holder of tribunician power for the nineteenth time, consul for the fourth time, and pater patriae. Of those titles, the most useful for dating is the tribunitia potestas (tribunician power), which was awarded to Caracalla annually starting in 198. The glowering visage of the twenty-eight-year-old, war-hardened ruler can be compared to the portrait on cat. 61, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Caracalla, twelve years earlier, which intentionally resembled a young Marcus Aurelius. The obverse legend GERM[anicus] refers to his recent German campaigns of 212\u201313, but the reverse points to Egypt in the person of the Greco-Egyptian god Serapis. Caracalla had decided he was not a new Antonine but rather the new Alexander the Great, and in 215 headed to Egypt to visit Alexandria and the tomb (now lost) of Alexander. He also visited the temple of Serapis, possibly looking for a cure for an ill-defined ailment. (The visit turned out badly for the Alexandrians: offended by their mockery of his claim, Caracalla ordered a massacre of the assembled inhabitants.) Serapis appears frequently on the coins of the Severans.\n\nIn order to pay for his troops\u2019 loyalty after the murder of Geta, and for the upcoming Parthian wars, in 213 Caracalla called in current silver and gold coins and reminted them at a reduced weight: the aureus now about 6.5 grams (from the 7.3 grams it had been under Nero), as is seen by this coin, and a reduction in the purity of the silver in the denarius to a mere 50 percent. In 215 he introduced a new denarius tariffed at double the face value but only one-and-a-half times the weight and silver content: the \u201cantoninianus.\u201d  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">He also had his young wife, Plautilla, executed at the same time; see cat. 60, Denarius (Coin) Portraying Plautilla. Despite all this, Caracalla continued to style himself on his coins as PIVS, \u201cdutiful.\u201d\n\nHarl, Coinage in the Roman Economy, pp. 128, 216; for the problems concerning calculation of the actual amount, see Develin, \u201cArmy Pay Raises.\u201d\n\nHerodian, History of the Empire after Marcus 4.8.1\u20132, 4.8.6\u20139, 4.9; Dio Cassius, Roman History 78.15.2\u20137, 78.22\u201323.
