    "short_description": "Throughout his career, American artist Spencer Finch has used color and light as primary subjects\u2014and materials\u2014in his drawings, photographs, mixed media projects, and large-scale installations. Best known for exploring ideas about memory and perception, the artist often employs a colorimeter, a device that measures the average color and temperature of light that exists naturally in a specific place and time. With this information in hand, Finch reconstructs the luminosity of the location through artificial means.",
