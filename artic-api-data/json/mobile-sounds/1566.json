    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this late 16th century bronze panel, the Virgin Mary turns, startled by the appearance of the Angel Gabriel. He points to heaven, telling Mary that she will bear God's son, as cherubs part the clouds to allow the dove of the Holy Spirit to descend upon her. The panel was made in Venice by the sculptor Alessandro Vittoria. He based his composition on a painting of the Annunciation by the great Venetian artist Titian. Vittoria modeled the scene in wax then cast it in bronze. The soft, malleable wax enabled him to create a wonderfully animated surface whose real play of light and shadow could not exist in a painting. The folds of the figures' clothing and the clouds above swirl and billow, expressing the drama and emotion of the moment. Notice also how Mary and Gabriel's upper bodies are sculpted almost in the round, giving them a great sense of liveliness and movement.</p>\n",
