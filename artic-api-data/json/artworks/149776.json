    "description": "<p>A leader among the nation\u2019s second generation of sculptors, John Quincy Adams Ward played a significant role in elevating the medium in the United States, calling for a new realism to address moral concerns. Inspired by Abraham Lincoln\u2019s 1862\u201363 Emancipation Proclamation, <em>The Freedman</em> reflects not only Ward\u2019s aspiration to create relevant statements on pressing issues of the day but also his abolitionist sentiments. Using antiquity as his inspiration, he depicted a seminude man seated on a tree stump who has just been liberated from the shackles that bound him to slavery. Ward broke artistic convention by showing the former enslaved person as master of his own destiny, not a man reliant on white men for freedom. The vestiges of chains, potent symbols of his bondage, dangle from both wrists, and his muscular body, turned to look over his shoulder, is contained within a formal, triangular composition. <em>The Freedman</em> was modeled from life and is generally considered among the first naturalistic sculptural representations of an African American. Shortly after <em>The Freedman</em> was first exhibited in 1863, art critic James Jackson Jarves effectively summarized the work\u2019s power: \u201cWe have seen nothing in our sculpture more soul-lifting or more comprehensively eloquent. It tells in one word the whole sad story of slavery and the bright story of emancipation.\u201d</p>\n",
