R. Way recollected that The Fan was Whistler\u2019s fourth transfer lithograph, drawn at about the same time as Gaiety Stage Door (cat. 14) and Victoria Club (cat. 15). The model for this lithograph, shown seated at an angle on one of the lightweight chairs Whistler kept in his studio, may be Maud Franklin (see cat. 3, cat. 4, cat. 5, cat. 6, and cat. 10). Like Whistler\u2019s chalk and pastel studies made in the early 1870s of standing female figures, many of whom carry fans, this lithograph demonstrates the artist\u2019s fascination with costume. Despite the simplicity of his drawing style, he has carefully recorded the details of the model\u2019s dress.\n\nThe image was sketched lightly with a crayon on the same coarse-grained transfer paper Whistler employed for Gaiety Stage Door. There is a faint registration mark 2 mm below the image, slightly left of center. Although T. R. Way did include the print in his first catalogue (1896), the fact that very few proofs were pulled suggests that Whistler regarded it primarily as an experimental effort. There were no impressions in the artist\u2019s estate.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), cream chine (Japanese paper, 263 \u00d7 187 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (383 \u00d7 275 mm); ivory plate paper (267 \u00d7 192 mm); MWC, grayish ivory plate paper (264 \u00d7 189 mm), inscribed verso, in an unidentified hand, The first proof taken and Not more than twelve in all / T.

Way, June 1905.\n\nRemarks: An impression in Pittsburgh, Carnegie Museum of Art, was printed on a brown paper similar to that used for the experimental proof of Study (cat. 6) in Chicago (MWC, 30.1984). Other impressions are found in Boston, BPL; and New York, MMA.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K. Stratis, Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Margaret F. MacDonald, \u201cMaud Franklin,\u201d in Fine (1987), p. 23. Maud Franklin gave birth to a daughter on 13 February 1879. Thus, if the sitter is indeed Franklin, the lithograph must postdate her pregnancy. T. R.
