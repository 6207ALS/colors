After leaving his family to pursue his art in the late 1880s, Gauguin kept in touch with his five offspring both directly and through his Danish wife, Mette. In Brittany and then in Polynesia, he devoted a remarkable number of works in all media to the various stages of childhood and issues of growth and gender, believing that children had access to a more pure experience of life than adults in \u201ccivilized\u201d European society.\n\nPolynesian Woman with Children is one of a handful of portrait-like compositions that Gauguin painted after his return to Tahiti in 1895. In September 1901, the year inscribed on the painting, the artist left Tahiti for the Marquesas Islands. Most scholars have argued that Gauguin executed the majority of the paintings dated to 1901 while still in Tahiti; however, it is not exactly clear when the artist completed the Chicago canvas. It is possible that he painted this work in Tahiti; this notion was reinforced early in the painting\u2019s history with the titles ascribed to it. It is equally possible, however, that Gauguin completed it in the Marquesas.\n\nGauguin did not inscribe a title onto this painting, and there are no known references to the work in his letters. It was called Famille de tahitienne (Tahitian Family) when it was displayed at Ambroise Vollard\u2019s gallery in Paris in 1906. That title, which has persisted for over a century, along with other variations that do not specify a family relationship between the figures (such as Tahitian Woman with Children and Tahitian Woman and Children), seems to have been invented by Vollard, something he did for many of the artist\u2019s untitled works. Although the composition\u2014a seated woman holding a baby in her lap and an older child standing at their side holding a cat\u2014might depict family members, it is also possible that it represents a group of people of varying ages who are not related. In any case, the three figures could have had personal significance for Gauguin, functioning as stand-ins for people in his own complex family life.\n\nThe painting\u2019s composition may well have been prompted by a photograph Gauguin owned of a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger of his family (fig. 122.1 and fig. 122.2), which depicts his wife and two oldest children, a boy and a girl. Gauguin mentioned the portrait in his 1903 text Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and after):\n\nIn front of me is a photograph of one of Degas\u2019s paintings. . . . Underneath that is a portrait by Holbein in the Dresden museum. Her [the wife\u2019s] hands are so tiny, too little to be those of a human\u2019s, appearing to have no bones or muscles. These hands bother me, and I say that these hands are not by Holbein.\n\nPerhaps in reaction to the hands of Holbein\u2019s spouse, Gauguin was inspired to do just the opposite in the Chicago painting, in which the size of the woman\u2019s right hand is very large in proportion to the rest of her body; it is even possible the artist modeled it on his own.\n\nX-rays and infrared images indicate that Gauguin worked and reworked the composition (see Technical Study). Among the many changes are alterations to the dress, which previously draped farther to the right, and to the seated figure\u2019s hands, which initially were closer together and aligned horizontally below those of the baby (see fig. 122.3 and Technical Study). The original position of the woman\u2019s hands recalls the way Paul C\u00e9zanne, whom Gauguin much admired (see cat. 23), often portrayed those of his wife (see fig. 122.4). The C\u00e9zannesque quality of this earlier stage of the composition is underscored by pentimenti in the upper left corner showing a floral motif (like those in the wallpaper of many paintings by the older artist), which Gauguin later painted out (see fig. 122.5 and Technical Study). Technical analysis of this area reveals orange and red flowers with green leaves in what appears to be a shallow bowl or a squat, wide-mouthed vase\u2014possibly another nod to C\u00e9zanne\u2014which the artist also decided against including. Still another reference to the Proven\u00e7al master might be that, in the final stage of the painting, Gauguin added \u201cPaul\u201d to his already-present surname.\n\nUnlike many other instances in which Gauguin readily adapted figures and poses from photographs he had of classical sculpture, Javanese Buddhist friezes, examples by Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Edgar Degas, among others, it seems that in the case of Holbein\u2019s family portrait, it was the subject of the painting and not its exact form, format, or details that Gauguin found intriguing. If that is the case, perhaps he intended this painting to be understood as a portrait of members of his family.\n\nGauguin wrote a fair amount about the attitudes of Tahitians toward family. He observed that, rather than a focus on the nuclear family structure that ordered bourgeois European society, in Polynesia a child could have more than one mother, thus growing up with an expanded support network that included \u201cmany parents.\u201d The Tahitian equivalent for this phrase is \u201cmea rahi metua,\u201d a variation of which Gauguin inscribed on the 1893 depiction of his young mistress Tehamana: Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana) (see cat. 50).\n\nThe woman in the present work not only wears a wedding ring but also plays a clearly nurturing role with regard to the baby (whose sex is not identifiable), who sits comfortably on what seems to be a familiar lap. The older child has no apparent link with the woman except for being present in the picture. Gauguin later added the cat she holds (an attribute in a way similar to the dolls held by children in traditional European portraits). All three faces, the result of much deliberation on Gauguin\u2019s part, look out at the viewer rather than at one another. Their self-containment recalls the impassive expressions of another trio of figures in an earlier work by Gauguin, an 1899/1900 transfer drawing entitled Nativity (fig. 122.6 [Field 1973 68]).\n\nIn Tahiti Gauguin had at least two children that we know of with two mistresses. His first Tahitian mistress (vahine) was Tehamana \u2014whom he immortalized as Tehura in Noa Noa (see cat. 50), his account of his first sojourn in Tahiti. Gauguin revealed that Tehamana was pregnant in a letter to Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, in the fall of 1892, in which he announced that he was soon to be a father again. Aside from this mention by Gauguin, however, very little is known about this child. There is no record of the child\u2019s birth (which may not have been unusual), nor did Gauguin ever mention the child in subsequent correspondence. If Noa Noa\u2014which Gauguin wrote during the winter of 1893/94\u2014tells us anything about actual events in his life, then Tehamana and Gauguin did not produce a child together, for her literary double, Tehura, does not have children. One possible explanation for this omission of the birth of a child is that he or she did not survive. Another is that the artist did not mention this pregnancy in his narrative because he wanted to avoid putting such confessions on paper, especially since he planned on publishing Noa Noa. And he was still married to, although estranged from, Mette Gauguin.\n\nThe older child in the present painting may then represent or imagine Tehamana\u2019s offspring, who would have been eight or nine had he or she lived when Gauguin was working on the canvas. The lack of interaction between this figure and the other two could suggest that the figure is an apparition. It is also possible that the older child symbolizes Gauguin\u2019s beloved Danish daughter, Aline, whom he had last seen when she was sixteen and who had died in 1897.\n\nGauguin had two children with his second vahine, Pahura. The first, a girl, died shortly after her birth in 1897. In January 1899, Pahura told Gauguin that she was pregnant again. Gauguin, who had gone through a bout of depression the previous winter so severe that he tried to commit suicide, wrote to Monfreid about the pregnancy in March: \u201cI even consider it a joyous event, in the sense that this child will perhaps bring me back to life, since the dismal circumstances of my situation have been weighing on me so much of late.\u201d A son was born on April 19, and Gauguin named him \u00c9mile Marae a Tai (his first child with Mette had the same first name, spelled \u201cEmil,\u201d its Danish form). The boy would have been about two when Gauguin undertook Polynesian Woman with Children. Thus it is not inconceivable that the child on the woman\u2019s lap is \u00c9mile or a substitute.\n\nIf these children symbolize Gauguin\u2019s offspring (one living and one perhaps dead), then who is the seated woman? Since both children are young, the apparent age of this figure makes her identification challenging. Pahura was only fourteen in January 1896, when she became the artist\u2019s mistress, so she was no more than nineteen in 1901. Even if Pahura\u2019s fairly difficult life took its toll on her physically, the woman seen here is at least in her forties or older. Given that in Tahiti children were often parented by an extended family, the woman in the Chicago picture could instead be a grandmother or other senior \u201cfamily\u201d member.\n\nIt may not be possible, then, to identify the seated woman in Polynesian Woman with Children with certainty based on Gauguin\u2019s biography alone. Further, technical analysis suggests that Gauguin reworked her facial features, raising her hairline and elongating her eyes. These modifications and the artist\u2019s use of a palette knife to flatten and blend paint create a masklike appearance and, together with the strong shadows he added late in the painting process, underscore her appearance as an older woman (see Technical Study). Furthermore, the changes may have contributed to generalizing the woman\u2019s appearance, making a definite identification impossible.\n\nRegardless of the identities of the models, Polynesian Woman with Children explores the visual poetics of skin color, which clearly fascinated Gauguin. The woman and the older child both possess a deep-orange complexion, while the youngster has pale-yellowish-tan skin that suggests mixed racial parentage or ancestry. As Art Institute paintings conservator Kristin Lister notes, for the skin of all three figures, Gauguin initially used an orange-brown wash, to which he applied olive shading. Only in the final phase of development did he add brown to the woman\u2019s face, orange to the child\u2019s face, and pale olive and pink to the baby\u2019s skin (see Technical Study). While Gauguin could have been offering here an anthropological observation about race, a more likely possibility is that he made chromatic choices in response to aesthetic needs, such as the relationship of the skin tones to the figures\u2019 clothing and to the space around each of them. The artist seems to have wanted the blue of the background and woman\u2019s dress to play off the violet red and dark pink of the older child\u2019s smock, which has faded to a pale pink due to the fugitive nature of red lake pigments (see fig. 122.7 and Technical Study).\n\nThe domination of blue in this painting\u2014from the greenish blue of the abstract background to the deep blue of the woman\u2019s dress\u2014along with the somber expressions of the three figures, creates a melancholic mood. We cannot determine whether this reflects the artist\u2019s continuing grief over Aline\u2019s death in 1897, over the fact that he was by now totally estranged from his own family (it is doubtful that he ever knew about the death of his second-oldest son, Clovis, in 1900), or over the losses he experienced while in his Tahitian relationships. Nonetheless, such losses must have made him ponder his troubled role as a father. This late painting, then, could very well be a meditation not only on children\u2014perhaps his own\u2014but also on the Polynesian practice of communal parenting and the European model of the nuclear family, neither of which proved to be sustainable choices for him.  \nRichard R. Brettell and Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">For Polynesian Woman with Children Gauguin used a pre-primed, medium-weight, no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-format (92 \u00d7 73 cm) linen canvas. The commercial primed ground is primarily lead white, applied in a fluid, thin layer that conforms to the weave of the canvas, only minimally softening its texture. After the canvas was stretched, Gauguin added a second ground layer on the front surface, very intermittently applying a coat of stiffer white (not analyzed) by brush, which caught on the high points of the weave in spots and accentuated the surface texture. Gauguin then drew thin outlines for the composition with charcoal. He strengthened some lines with a dark-blue painted sketch, but most of the dark-blue contour lines visible in the final painting were added later, during the painting process. Each compositional area was then blocked in with a thin, translucent layer of color. In the final layers Gauguin built up the forms with thin strokes using small brushes, although for blocking in he sometimes used a larger brush.Throughout the painting process, he manipulated the paint after applying it, wiping or dry brushing away paint to thin or blend colors or to introduce translucency. With a palette knife he scraped away unwanted paint, flattened the top paint layers, blended brushstrokes and colors, and applied intermediate white layers to block out earlier passages he intended to rework. While the top half of the woman\u2019s dress was constructed with blocks of different colors, the artist employed an altogether different technique for the skirt, which he built up with multiple layers of dark blue, allowing variations in translucency to indicate the form. Consequently, while the cloth in the upper part of the dress appears bunched in stiff folds and is part of the panoply of forms at the composition\u2019s center, the skirt drops away into more subtle undulations.\n\nDuring the painting\u2019s development, Gauguin made significant changes to the composition. After the initial laying in, he shifted the balance of the composition by painting out a panel of the woman\u2019s skirt on the right side and adding one to the left, thereby making room for the left leg of the standing child. After applying an intermediate white layer, he reworked the position of the mother\u2019s hands, which were initially set close together in a horizontal position below the baby\u2019s hands. Instead, the hands of all three figures now are aligned along a diagonal that cuts through the composition, which had previously been tighter and more constrained. He also lengthened and narrowed the head of the standing child. He first applied a large area of thick white, toned with a translucent, warm-gray layer at the top right that extended sporadically from the mother\u2019s chair down through the cat and to the child\u2019s knees, skirting around the child\u2019s rounder head. The layer of white suggests that there were different preliminary forms, but there is to date no technical evidence of it.\n\nThe cat held by the child, as well as the white ruff on the dress, were not part of the composition as initially painted. Both were sketched in dark blue on top of the smock. After sketching the cat over the dress with blue, Gauguin underpainted its body in bright green before completing it. The dark-brown spot on the child\u2019s hand appears to be part of the composition, and there is no evidence that the spot is restoration that has darkened over time. Under the brown paint there is a large bump that the artist apparently tried to flatten. The baby\u2019s head and expression was altered later in the process to appear more idealized and less expressive.\n\nThe background was built up with many thinly layered strokes of varying colors and transparency. Gauguin often wiped back or abraded down a layer or glaze to increase its transparency or added a scumble to tone down variations and then dry brushed the scumble into a thinner veil. The shifting tones create an undefined but atmospheric surround for the figural group.\n\nA floral motif at some point was present in the upper left corner of the composition. Orange, red, and green are visible beneath the top paint layer, and infrared imaging reveals what were likely flowers with leaves in a basket, bowl, or squat, wide-mouthed vase. This corner motif was probably retained throughout the painting process. The blue-gray background color used to cover it was added just before Gauguin signed and dated the work, mixing wet-in-wet with the signature, and indicates that the blue-gray used to cover the object was added near in time to the signature. At some later point, Paul was added in front of the surname wet-over-dry using a lighter, less distinct blue.\n\nPolynesian Woman with Children has experienced significant fading of the red lake pigments in the child\u2019s presently pale-pink smock. It was originally darker violet-red and darker pink, shaded with purples, as is revealed along the edge, which was covered by paper tape, protecting the colors from exposure to light. The work has never been varnished but has a wax coating.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 122.8).\n\nSigned and dated: Paul (top left corner, in medium-blue paint), Gauguin (in dark-blue paint); 1901 (below the name, and separated from it by a dash above the date (in dark-blue paint) (fig. 122.9). Gauguin and 1901 were added wet-in-wet over the top blue-gray layer, and the inevitable mixing of the paints diluted the color of the letters. They were reinforced with strokes of stronger color in a few areas (fig. 122.10). At an early point in the painting process, a basket or vase of flowers had been painted here (see Application and artist\u2019s revision). Paul appears to have been added later than the rest of the inscription, though it seems consistent with Gauguin\u2019s hand. Paul was added wet-over-dry (fig. 122.11), and it has also been lightly wiped. Furthermore, Paul appears constricted, which suggests that it was fit into the space after Gauguin was already in place. The thinner blue makes this word less prominent than the rest of the signature.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were close to 92 \u00d7 73 cm, which corresponds to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-format (92 \u00d7 73 cm) stretcher. The present stretcher is larger than this standard size by 0.5 cm on each side, with an additional wood strip one centimeter wide extending the top edge further still under the paper edge tape. This wood strip was added or reattached after the painting was lined and stretched but before the first layer of paper edge tape was added (fig. 122.12). It is possible that the larger stretcher and even the extra wood strip date from the first restretching in France after the rolled canvas had arrived from Polynesia. Darkened overpaint is evident along the top edge, where the original paint ends and the painting has been extended (fig. 122.13).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 11.0V (0.3) \u00d7 14.0H (0.3) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp, and the vertical threads to the weft. The warp threads appear thinner than the weft.\n\nThe canvas is medium weight and moderately tightly woven. Widely spaced primary cusping, approximately 35 cm apart, is visible on the right edge of the vertical thread-angle map. No selvage edges are present.\n\nCurrent stretching: Predates 1927, when the painting entered the Art Institute collection, and probably dates from the earlier lining. The tacking margins are presently 1.5 cm wide but were cut along with the lining canvas near the back edge of the stretcher.\n\nThe painting\u2019s larger dimensions would seem to postdate the lining, because the extra strip of wood was added along the top edge after the lined painting was restretched. But it is possible that the wood strip had previously been on the stretcher and was considered too weak to stretch the relined canvas over, so was taken off and added again after stretching.\n\nOriginal stretching: The pre-primed ground extends over the tacking margins. The second ground and original paint both stop at what was the front edge of the original stretcher. The top edge of the stretcher Gauguin originally used was not square, since the painted top edge slopes down markedly to the right. There is secondary cusping revealed on the top and bottom edges of the horizontal thread-angle map, with tacks approximately 5 cm apart (fig. 122.14). The tension of being stretched off square is also indicated on this map. There is no earlier fold line or edge crack in the pre-primed ground that might relate to the original stretching, and the original tacking margins of unpainted white ground that were folded to the front are clean. This suggests that the canvas may have been enlarged very early, perhaps when it first arrived in France after shipment from Polynesia.\n\nThere are horizontal cracks in the thicker paint along the right edge, indicating the canvas was probably rolled for shipment to France (fig. 122.15). Because the edges are, for the most part, covered with later paper tape, few conclusions can be drawn about the original stretching or the first restretching after the canvas arrived in France.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Predates the 1927 acquisition by the Art Institute. Two crossbars; half-lap corner joints with keys. The patina is that of an aged stretcher (Standard Format). Width: 6.6 cm. Depth: 2 cm (fig. 122.12).\n\nOriginal stretcher: The current stretcher may be the first stretcher used upon the arrival of the rolled canvas in France. The large number of early labels and inscriptions on the reverse of this stretcher suggest it may be the earliest one after shipment.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nSeveral cross sections show evidence of an organic layer between the ground and canvas that has a light-blue autofluorescence in ultraviolet, and is possibly glue (fig. 122.16).\n\nThere are two white ground layers. The lower, slightly off-white ground is a commercial priming that extends over the tacking margins, indicating that it was applied over a larger piece of fabric before this particular canvas was cut out of it and stretched (see fig. 122.16). Large sweeping curves in the X-ray indicate that the ground was applied with a knife (fig. 122.17). This thin, smooth priming was most likely applied in a very fluid consistency, and it covers the canvas and interstices completely, conforming to the canvas weave without masking its texture (fig. 122.18). The thickness of this layer ranges from 37 to 135 \u03bcm.\n\nThe intermittent upper layer of white ground, added by the artist after the canvas had been stretched, is of a stiffer consistency and was applied by brush, which left a slightly raised texture in spots (fig. 122.19). In many intermittent areas the stiff, white paint caught on the tops of the canvas weave only, adding a rougher texture to the surface. (fig. 122.20 and fig. 122.21).\n\nFor the most part, Gauguin extended the top paint layers to the original stretcher edges, leaving little of the ground layer exposed, but he did not do this throughout. The edges are now covered by overpaint and paper tape, but the small, uneven areas of exposed ground at the bottom edge, and also visible where the paper tape was removed on the right edge, are characteristic of Gauguin\u2019s original, often uneven, paint edges (fig. 122.22). Exposed white ground can still be seen in some areas, particularly in the mother\u2019s collar and chair back, and in areas of her dress that are thinly painted, such as the sleeve and the bodice below the waist, which had no lay-in (fig. 122.23).\n\nThe pre-primed ground appears white, but is slightly off-white based on the traces of colored pigments visible in the cross sections. The artist\u2019s second, intermittent ground appears white but is not present in the three analyzed cross sections.\n\nAnalysis determined that the pre-primed ground is lead white with traces of iron oxide brown and iron oxide yellow-orange with associated silicates; and traces of bone black, ultramarine blue, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate, and barium sulfate.\n\nGauguin drew thin outlines, apparently in charcoal, directly on the ground for the elements of the composition, such as the figures and chair. Most of the charcoal lines were scattered by ensuing paint strokes, which may also account for the fact that drawn lines were not detected with infrared reflectography (fig. 122.24). Under stereomicroscopic examination some lines remain uncovered and are visible, for example, between the baby\u2019s toes, where the top of the baby\u2019s green cloth meets the mother\u2019s dress, and between the mother\u2019s left cheek and chair (fig. 122.25 and fig. 122.26). In addition to outer contours, Gauguin drew some of the interior folds of the mother\u2019s bodice, beneath the yoke (fig. 122.27).\n\nGauguin also added dark-blue contour lines in some areas later during the painting process to reaffirm contours. For example, in the standing child\u2019s face he added blue lines on top of the initial lay-in to mark the shape of the eyebrow and eye more definitively (fig. 122.28).\n\nIn other spots Gauguin painted contour lines of different colors to add elements over previous paint layers. He sketched simple black circles on top of the initial background to add the flower to the woman\u2019s hair, as seen in the infrared reflectogram.\n\nUnderdrawing: The underdrawing medium was identified as charcoal black.\n\nPainted sketch: Dilute dark-blue; less dilute for blue, black, and brown outlines on top of paint layers. The medium is estimated as oil.\n\nIn the transmitted-infrared image, the baby is drawn with a chubbier chin and wider head than in the final version (fig. 122.29). This infrared image shows that a curved or U-shaped line on the chair arm was scraped off and covered, probably indicating an arm of a different shape.\n\nThe cat, the child\u2019s ruff, and possibly the positions of the child\u2019s hands were sketched with dark-blue contours on top of the painted smock. In the infrared image it appears that the cat may have been drawn without a second front leg (fig. 122.30).\n\nAfter the preliminary sketch Gauguin blocked in each area with a thin layer of paint, often using the same general color he intended to use later but applied more translucently and often with a larger brush (fig. 122.31). He did not apply an underlayer where he had first drawn interior folds at the waist of the woman\u2019s dress because it would have wiped away the charcoal drawing. He later painted this area wet-in-wet, applying highlights and shadows directly on the ground and drawing (fig. 122.32). The skin of all three figures was laid in with the same orange-brown wash, and although it was later finished with olive shading, Gauguin worked the woman\u2019s face with brown, the child\u2019s with orange, and the baby\u2019s with pale olive and pink. He underpainted the woman\u2019s dark-brown hair with opaque yellow-brown, which he left partially exposed at the top of her head (fig. 122.33).\n\nGauguin made a number of significant changes to the composition of Polynesian Woman with Children. After the initial lay-in, he added to the left side of the woman\u2019s skirt and reduced the right side. The position of the earlier skirt can be identified in the infrared reflectogram (Goodrich 1.1-1.4 um) image and under the stereomicroscope (fig. 122.34). On the left, the baby\u2019s foot had initially jutted beyond the edge of her skirt. On the right, the skirt previously extended as far as the end of the chair\u2019s arm, and after bulging slightly to indicate the previous knee turned to the right, it draped down, blocking out the right proper leg of the standing child (fig. 122.35). In making this change Gauguin reoriented the position of the woman's legs, twisting the lower half of her figure to the left. Gauguin repainted the child\u2019s second leg and smock directly on top of the dark-blue skirt and then covered what remained of the skirt with the dull-blue-green background color (fig. 122.36 and fig. 122.37).\n\nIn many other areas, when Gauguin wished to make a change, he laid down an intermediate layer of white with the palette knife to block out what he had previously painted. One such change, made later in the painting process, was the position of the woman\u2019s hands. They were initially smaller and closer together, holding the baby\u2019s legs, as revealed in the X-ray, while the orange cloth the baby grips was smaller and more red (fig. 122.38). To make this change, Gauguin scraped the area and blocked out the hands with a thin layer of white. Then, using light orange (perhaps suggested by the color of the earlier hands), he extended the baby\u2019s cloth to cover the large white area.\n\nGauguin also used light orange to block in the new hands without delineating all the fingers for the proper right hand (fig. 122.39). The wet-in-wet mixing of the orange with the green of the baby\u2019s blanket can be distinguished at the edges, which dates this change to rather later in the picture\u2019s genesis (fig. 122.40). The woman\u2019s white cuff was first drawn and painted as a snugly fitting scalloped band, perhaps of lace (see fig. 122.39). It was then sketched as a wider, simple band of fabric. During the final painting stage, it was made looser around her wrist, and blue embroidered stitches were added.\n\nFor the other hand, a comparison of the reflected-infrared and natural-light images reveals the repositioning of the fingers (fig. 122.41). The hand appeared oddly detached since the forearm at first did not continue on the right side. To remedy this, Gauguin added a slight protrusion beyond the baby\u2019s arm to indicate the woman\u2019s sleeved wrist. The infrared image also shows that the baby initially had closed fists; at a later stage fingertips were added directly over the cloth and mother\u2019s finger (fig. 122.41).\n\nIn the top right background Gauguin troweled on a thick, extra layer of white, applied in horizontal bands with a palette knife. It produced an undulating layer with horizontal grooves where the edge of the knife dug into the thick paint, and rough areas where the suction of the knife pulled up the paint when it was lifted (fig. 122.42 and fig. 122.43). It extends across to the chair and intermittently down to the child\u2019s knees as it thins out. It skirts very roughly around the child\u2019s head, holding it in reserve, cutting in at the neck and out around the ear, and inscribes a shorter, rounder head than the present one (see fig. 122.17). While it is possible that Gauguin applied the white to block out something underneath, no evidence of this has been observed. The artist added a relatively thick, translucent, warm-gray layer on top of the white. It is composed of a complex mixture of pigments and could be the artist\u2019s preliminary toning down of the bright white to bring it closer to the tonality of the background (fig. 122.44).\n\nGauguin lengthened the head of the standing child at a late stage in the painting process. Stereomicroscopic examination reveals that the earlier hairline was below the final forehead (fig. 122.45). The X-ray shows that the child\u2019s left shoulder originally extended all the way to the mother\u2019s sleeve (fig. 122.46), but at some point the background color was painted over the shoulder to separate the two subjects.\n\nThe cat held by the child and the white ruff on the smock were also added late to the composition. Both were sketched in dark blue on top of the violet smock. After sketching the cat, Gauguin underpainted its body in bright green, creating a rich contrast with the violet smock (fig. 122.47). The lower portions of the cat\u2019s stomach and legs extend beyond the green underpaint. Here the artist relied on toning the fur on top with green (fig. 122.48). As he had for the woman\u2019s later hands, Gauguin blocked the child\u2019s hands in with a lighter orange and then shaped their form with a darker orange-brown. Centered on the back of the right hand is a dark-brown spot, which covers a large white bump. There is no evidence that the brown spot is retouching that has darkened. PLM analysis showed the pigment mixture to be similar to other areas. Gauguin painted over the bump as he painted the surrounding hand with orange. Over this he added a thin red layer, and over that, the top dark brown, augmenting the anomaly rather than attempting to disguise it (fig. 122.49). He also used the palette knife on top of the paint, perhaps an attempt to flatten the bump, while paint in the adjacent areas of the hand was still wet\u2014evidence that this was done by the artist.\n\nThe baby\u2019s face was initially more individualized and wore a pouting expression, but during the painting process the expression was adjusted to be more impassive (fig. 122.50). The nose was made to appear thinner by cutting into it with a strong shadow. The baby\u2019s head was originally larger, with more protruding ears and a heavier jowl. An anomaly in the form, visible in the X-ray, suggests there may have been a flower in the baby\u2019s hair on the right side. The hair, previously bright red and orange with errant wisps and with curls lower on his forehead, was later subdued in color with olive and brown, and plastered more smoothly to his head.\n\nThe infrared image reveals that Gauguin changed the woman\u2019s features slightly (fig. 122.51). There is a heavily scraped area at the woman\u2019s shoulder above the baby\u2019s head that extends up the chair stile and rail.\n\nThe most extreme change to Polynesian Woman with Children has been the fading of the fugitive, cochineal-based red lake pigments in the child\u2019s smock (see Palette). Intense violet-red and deep-pink hues are revealed on the sleeve where they had been hidden from light damage by the paper tape around the painting\u2019s edges. (fig. 122.52 and fig. 122.53). It is not possible to determine which areas were darker violet red and which were deep or light pink, but an approximate recolorization has been made (fig. 122.54). Based on visual examination, the pink that remains over the smock is from the vermilion that Gauguin added to the mixtures of red lake and white, making the violet reds and pinks a warmer shade. The blue and dark-vermilion passages now stand out in stark contrast to the faded pink, where they originally would have transitioned more smoothly into the violet-red dress.\n\nIn the upper left corner, Gauguin had painted a motif of a few blossoms in red and orange with a sprig of green leaves, but he painted them out right before adding his signature (fig. 122.55). Texturally, there appears to be a shallow bowl or squat vase underneath the flowers.(fig. 122.56). Gauguin again made use of a flower motif in the top left corner in his Woman with a Fan (fig. 122.57 [W 609]).\n\nGauguin painted the top layers primarily with small brushes, even for large areas, often applied in blocks of hatched strokes. In spots, two colors are alternated in hatches so they could be mixed by the eye rather than becoming a muddier tone on the surface (fig. 122.58). Gauguin sometimes used cross-hatching to blend already applied colors by brushing in the perpendicular direction. (fig. 122.59). The paint layers on the baby\u2019s face are thick and smooth, obscuring underlying texture. Working wet-in-wet Gauguin blended the shading on his face and body more carefully with a brush than on the other two figures, lending the skin a smoother, more delicate appearance (fig. 122.60).\n\nDry brushing was used to thin layers, to brush paint out directionally, to mix and blend adjacent colors, and to create a thinner scumble or glaze (fig. 122.61). A cruder dry brushing was used on the baby\u2019s foot. Here Gauguin applied an olive layer for shading over the tan. Instead of blending it more smoothly, he pulled the dry brush through the wet paint, pushing it aside and creating coarse hatching reminiscent of finger painting (fig. 122.62). In other areas Gauguin wiped the paint, probably using a cloth, perhaps moistened with turpentine, to pull paint off the top of the threads, for instance, to create highlights in the woman\u2019s sleeve (fig. 122.63). Lightly passing over the surface with his finger could have achieved a similar effect.\n\nGauguin painted the top portion of the woman\u2019s dress with blocks of shifting color, incorporating lavender, pink, green, orange, red, and purple highlights along with different shades of blue (fig. 122.64). Here he used a larger brush, covering earlier, thinner strokes, contributing to the block-like construction. At the dress\u2019s front closure he was attentive to fine detail, allowing a meandering sliver of the lighter blue underlayer to show, enhanced here and there by a delicate black line of shadow, and added barely discernible buttons (fig. 122.65).\n\nPainted with a totally different technique, the skirt of the dress drops away in a dark-blue waterfall of subtle rippling strokes. Instead of using varied colors, Gauguin painted multiple layers of primarily dark blue, indicating form by varying the translucency and direction of brushstrokes (fig. 122.66)..\n\nFor the most part the highlights in the skirt were created by initially applying the paint more thinly and by setting off these thinner, brighter strokes with adjacent shadows of thicker, hence darker, blue. Gauguin also thinned highlights by wiping off paint along the folds. In select spots, the artist did mix white with the dark blue, which not only lightened the color but also covered underlayers more opaquely. He applied white with a palette knife over some areas that had become overworked, which allowed him to paint translucently again.\n\nGauguin put unusual energy into shifting the color, translucency, and direction of brushwork while painting the background. He began with a lay-in of pale blue that peeks out at the edges of forms. In the infrared reflectogram, the varied direction of the brushstrokes in the lower layers can be seen more clearly (fig. 122.67). For example, the many parallel curving strokes to the left of the mother\u2019s arm are in the lower layer, while in the final layers the brushstrokes are vertical.\n\nThe artist then added thin strokes of varied colors to create constantly shifting hues. Near the bottom he used an opaque dark olive green that sometimes shifts toward orange, as is seen adjacent to the mother\u2019s blue dress on the left. He also applied transparent dark green that varies from distinct individual strokes to barely discernible, fluid washes. Both can be seen in the lower left corner, as the strong almost vertical strokes, and in the infrared reflectogram (1.1\u20131.4 \u03bcm), as the dripping wash at the very bottom (see fig. 122.67). Further up, Gauguin applied intense blue strokes, and above that, opaque blue-gray, with pink scumbles closer to the woman\u2019s head (fig. 122.68).\n\nDuring this layering Gauguin would intermittently wipe and dry brush the wet layers to thin them or create scumbled veils (fig. 122.69). This action sometimes removed the paint from the tops of the threads only, revealing the layer beneath, or, with more vigorous wiping or on wetter paint, it removed the layers of paint down to the white ground. This abrasion by the artist can be seen at the left midsection of the background (fig. 122.70). It creates a sense of reflective, even sparkling, light, while the ever-shifting color adds an atmospheric envelope around the figures (fig. 122.71).\n\nGauguin used a variety of brushes: 0.05 [or the side of a larger brush], 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0 cm (based on width of brushstrokes).(fig. 122.72). He also used a palette knife and cloth or finger for wiping.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, chrome yellow, cadmium yellow, iron oxide yellow with associated silicate minerals, vermilion, red lake (cochineal-based), ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, Prussian blue, emerald green, viridian, iron oxide brown, carbon black, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, various silicates, silica, and barium sulfate. Ultraviolet light also indicates the presence of red lake. Comparison with the protected right edge indicates that the red lake pigment in child\u2019s pink smock has faded considerably.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe surface has never been varnished. There is presently a dirty wax residue remaining from the wax emulsion that was used to clean the surface in 1958. It may cover an earlier wax coating from Gauguin\u2019s time. Analysis of the original paint surface, where protected from this wax cleaning, may show whether the surface was originally waxed, as Gauguin had instructed Georges-Daniel de Monfreid much earlier.\n\nPre-1927: Aqueous lining and mismatched overpaint, especially noticeable around the edges, predate acquisition by the museum.\n\nFebruary 1959: Surface grime removed with wax emulsion. Small scratch and losses inpainted.\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition. It has probably never been exposed to strong solvents because it remains unvarnished. The aqueous lining was to a finer linen, and caused no significant textural change.\n\nThere are few paint losses, except at the very corners. The painting was extended by 0.5 cm on each side and 1.5 cm along the top edge. Where not covered by the paper edge tape these extensions were repainted, sometimes extending slightly over the original paint. This repaint has darkened. There are scattered areas of cracking, including some horizontal cracks from rolling the canvas, particularly abundant in the bottom half. There are also drying cracks, particularly in the upper right corner of the background blue, where it was painted over the thick, intermediate white layer Gauguin had applied.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2011): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a second-half-of-the-sixteenth-century, Italian, reverse-section cassetta frame. The frame has its original water gilding over a red-brown bole and gesso. The frame is burnished overall and retains the original glue size finish. The poplar cassetta is half-lapped, and the joints are glued and draw nailed. The inner and outer carved poplar moldings are mitered and applied with glue and draw nails on the inner and nailed on the outer. The frame has been adjusted in size for the painting. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight outer side; cove; ogee; flat frieze; cove; cove; fillet; torus; and fillet, with cove at the sight edge (fig. 122.73).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1929, removed 2011): The work was previously housed in a late 1920s\u20131930s, American, stylized Italian cassetta frame with a flat, painted-gray frieze. The frame has water gilding over a bright red bole on gesso and is burnished on the outer and sight molding. The frame is rubbed on the same moldings and has been heavily toned with washes and a pronounced speckling. The frieze of the frame was painted gray on top of this finish layer, and then another layer of toning was added overall. The basswood face molding is mitered and nailed with an inset-cap spline and glued to a deep straight-sided back frame with an inset-cap spline and glued and nailed across each miter. The sides are gessoed and finished as a continuation of the frame. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is straight outer side; fillet; quirked ogee; fillet; flat frieze; torus; fillet; and quirked ogee at the sight edge (fig. 122.74, fig. 122.75, fig. 122.76, and fig. 122.77).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1928 and removed by 1933): The work was previously housed in an American, plain-white molding frame. In 1928 each of the works in the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection was framed in either a white-painted frame or a plain, square-faced, profile- or torus-shaped molding, with a fillet and cove sight edge (fig. 122.78).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1927 and removed 1927/28): The work was previously housed in a gilded scotia frame with ornament at the miters and centers with ornament at the sight. This is the frame that housed the painting prior to its being purchased by Fredric C. Bartlett in February 1927 (fig. 122.79).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section other_documentation\" id=\"other_documentation\">Label  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar  \nMethod: blue printed label with handwritten script  \nContent: Nr. 29[?] / MODERNE GALERIE / THANNHAUSER / M\u00dcNCHEN :: THEATINERSTR. 7 (fig. 122.80)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar [this is under the preceding label and thus predates it]  \nMethod: handwritten script in blue  \nContent: [94] \u00d7 [72] (fig. 122.81)\n\nLabel  \nLocation: stretcher crossbar  \nMethod: printed label with blue ink stamp  \nContent: Gustav Knauer / [Logo] K\u00f6nigl.

Another important example from the following year is Woman with a Fan (1902; Museum Folkwang, Essen [W 609]), which depicts a seated woman\u2014thought to be Tohotaua, the wife of Gauguin\u2019s cook\u2014holding a white feather fan. The composition is also on a standard portrait-sized canvas that is vertically oriented.\n\nSee, for example, George T. M. Shackelford, \u201cWhere Do We Come from? What Are We?

Gauguin also mentioned the Holbein portrait earlier in this text (p. 45).\n\nFor the most part, Gauguin did not include \u201cPaul\u201d in his signature until 1898. The artist originally signed only \u201cGauguin\u201d on the Chicago painting. Clearly \u201cPaul\u201d was added separately and later, for not only did he execute it in a different color from that of his surname, but he also had to squeeze it into a constricted space. In addition to this painting, four others from 1901 feature a signature with both \u201cPaul\u201d and \u201cGauguin\u201d: Sunflowers (Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow [W 597]), La fuite ou le gu\u00e9 (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W 603]), Nature morte \u00e0 l\u2019esp\u00e9rance (private collection W 604), and Still Life with Knife (Foundation E. G. B\u00fchrle collection [W 607]).\n\nThe compositional structure of Holbein\u2019s portrait is reminiscent of Christian representations of the Madonna with the infant Jesus and John the Baptist (see, e.g., Raphael\u2019s Madonna and Child with the Infant Baptist [c. 1509\u201310; National Gallery, London]). Britt Salvesen argues that Gauguin\u2019s composition is also reminiscent of this Christian scene; see Salvesen, Gauguin, in association with Douglas W. Druick and Peter Kort Zegers, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 2001), p. 68. The similarities are found particularly in the compositional structure: a seated woman with one infant seated on her lap and another, slightly older child off to the side. According to Salvesen, \u201cThe older child, although clearly a girl, plays the role of the Baptist and holds an iconographically obscure cat.\u201d For more on Holbein\u2019s composition, see Jochen Sander, Hans Holbein D.J.: Tafelmaler in Basel, 1515\u20131532 (Hirmer, 2005), pp. 323\u201334.\n\nFor Gauguin\u2019s explanation of Polynesian traditions related to parenthood, see Gauguin to Monfreid, Mar. 31, 1893, in The Letters of Paul Gauguin to Georges Daniel de Monfreid, foreword by Frederick O\u2019Brien, trans.

See Hiriata Millaud, \u201cLes titres tahitiens de Gauguin,\u201d in Ia orana Gauguin, exh. cat.

Furthermore, while Gauguin inscribed his mistress\u2019s name as Tehamana on the Art Institute\u2019s portrait (cat. 50), according to Danielsson, her name was actually Teha\u2019amana; see Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, trans. Reginald Spink (G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), p. 281, n. 84.\n\nGauguin had a child with his third vahine, Vaeoho Marie Rose, the fourteen-year-old daughter of a local chief whom Gauguin met soon after his arrival on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa. Their daughter, Tahiatikaomata, was born September 14, 1902. See Gloria Groom, \u201cChronology: July 1895\u2013November 1903,\u201d in Richard R.

True, having kids here is not really a burden, they are generally well received, a support system created in advance by all the parents. The real question is, who will be their nourishing parents, those who will nurture and cultivate them? As you know, the biggest blessing here is having a child, so I am not at all worried about its future.\u201d Gauguin to Monfreid, in Lettres de Paul Gauguin, foreword by Victor Segalen (G. Cr\u00e8s, 1922), p. 112, no. 11, translation courtesy of Elpida Vouitsis. The date of this letter as published by Segalen\u2014March 31, 1893\u2014has been disputed. See Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, trans. Reginald Spink (G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), pp. 121; 282, n. 93, who dated the letter to September 1892. See also Charles F.

(National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society of Books, 1988), p. 213, in which he suggests that the letter was written around August 1892.\n\nAccording to Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, trans. Reginald Spink (G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), p. 121, Tehamana never gave birth to this child. See also Charles F. Stuckey, \u201cThe First Tahitian Years,\u201d in Richard R.

Ruth Pielkovo (Dodd, Mead, 1922), p. 81, no. 24, in which Gauguin conveys his grief and anger at the delay and manner in which he learned of his oldest daughter\u2019s death: \u201c[Mette] tells me brutally of the death of my oldest daughter who was carried off in a few days by pernicious pneumonia. . . . Surely in the heavens I must have some enemy who will not give me even a few peaceful moments.\u201d Aline died in Copenhagen on January 19, 1897. On the last time Gauguin saw Aline and on her death, see Isabelle Cahn, \u201cChronology: July 1886\u2013April 1891,\u201d and Gloria Groom, \u201cChronology: July 1895\u2013November 1903,\u201d in Richard R.

For the birth of Pahura\u2019s children and the paintings these events inspired, see also George T. M. Shackelford, \u201cThe Return to Paradise: Tahiti, 1895\u20131897,\u201d in Shackelford and Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, Gauguin Tahiti, with additional essays by Isabelle Cahn et al., exh. cat. (MFA Publications, 2004), pp. 147\u201356.\n\nSee Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, trans. Reginald Spink (G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), p. 182. Danielsson found Pahura\u2019s birth certificate; she was born on June 27, 1881.\n\nOn Pahura\u2019s difficulties, including the loss of her first child and having to care for Gauguin during his frequent bouts of ill health, see Bengt Danielsson, Gauguin in the South Seas, trans. Reginald Spink (G. Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965), pp. 190, 207, 210.\n\nGauguin\u2019s writings and the title of his 1901 painting Et l\u2019or de leur corps (And the Gold of Their Skin) (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 596]) reveal his fascination with skin color and, by extension, race, but it is not clear how much of this can be read into his paintings. Various skin tones are found in a number of paintings, including D\u2019o\u00f9 venons-nous? Qui sommes-nous? O\u00f9 allons-nous? (Where Do We Come From? Who Are We? Where Are We Going?) (1898; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston [W 561]).\n\nIn this area, darker, more vibrant reds and purples are present; paper tape that had covered the painting\u2019s edge protected the colors from light damage. See Technical Study.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe following pigments were identified by XRF in the signature, but pigments in the background were picked up as well: lead white, emerald green, vermilion, zinc-containing pigment, cobalt blue, iron oxide\u2013containing pigment, chromium-containing pigment, barium sulfate, and calcium compound. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cGaug\\_PolynWoman\\_1927\\_460\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 17, 2013, revised Mar. 18, 2014, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification (PLM); see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 7, 2014, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe original size is presently difficult to ascertain, because overpaint and paper tape hide most of the edges. In small areas where these have been removed, there is a consistently wide border of unpainted ground around the edges that was probably the original tacking edges, with a few strokes extending over onto the sides.Furthermore, both the brush marks of Gauguin\u2019s second ground layer, and the palette knife marks from the third white layer at the top left edge, end abruptly at the same border, 0.5 cm in from the present stretcher edge, undoubtedly the original edge.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See C. Richard Johnson, Jr., Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Paul Gauguin, Polynesian Woman with Children 1901 (W595/ 1927.460), January 2014.\u201d\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See C. Richard Johnson, Jr., Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Paul Gauguin, Polynesian Woman with Children 1901 (W595/ 1927.460), January 2014.\u201d Don Johnson suggests this may be close to the beginning or end of a bolt.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See C. Richard Johnson, Jr., Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Paul Gauguin, Polynesian Woman with Children 1901 (W595/ 1927.460), January 2014.\u201d Kim Muir, assistant research conservator, Art Institute of Chicago, first suggested that the overall tension (blue color) visible on the horizontal thread-angle map was due to stretching the fabric off-square on the stretcher originally.\n\nThere are two sets of tacks, both of which date to after the lining, on the X-ray, smaller tacks at 2.5\u20133.0 cm intervals, and larger tacks at 3.0\u20133.5 cm intervals. The smaller ones, visible on the edges under the paper tape, are tacked through the original and lining canvases together. The larger tacks are through the lining canvas only, indicating that the tacking edges of the original and lining canvases were secured separately after lining. Another set of holes in the tacking edges date from the addition of metal strip moldings (no longer present). L.P. [Louis Pomerantz], treatment report, Mar. 31, 1959, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nRemoval of the paper tape would show the number of tack holes in the wood, compared to those in the canvas, which could help determine whether this was the first stretcher postshipment.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 7, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAll edges were cut through the existing ground at the time of the lining.\n\nThese large light sweeps on the X-ray are identified as the priming of a larger piece of fabric because the sweep of these palette knife marks seem as though they would continue beyond the edges of the present canvas.\n\nIt can also be identified under the mother\u2019s forehead where Gauguin\u2019s later palette knife work has flattened the top orange paint layer, pushing it into the texture of this ground layer while exposing the white highpoints. It is possible that some of the raised texture is the result of metal soap formation in the paint or ground layer that occurred after the the painting was completed.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX (lead white, iron oxides, bone black, ultramarine blue, calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate and barium sulfate), PLM (lead white and calcium carbonate), and XRF (lead white, iron oxides, calcium compounds, bone black). There are no analytical results for the artist\u2019s second ground layer. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 7, 2016; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cGaug\\_PolynWoman\\_1927\\_460\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec 17, 2013, rev. Mar. 18, 2014, both on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe charcoal was identified by PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report, \u201c June 7, 2016, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s technique and published analyses of Gauguin paintings in other collections.\n\nGauguin had similarly added a panel of skirt to the figure to shift the composition in Portrait of a Woman in front of a Still Life by C\u00e9zanne; see cat. 23.\n\nGauguin may have painted this leg lighter than the other to negate the effects of the blue underneath. Although it looks like the child\u2019s foot can be seen through the woman\u2019s dress, this is not the case. There is some graying repaint that, combined with the thinness of the area, suggests a foot shape that is not there.\n\nThe texture of this area brings to mind the thick, uneven ground that Gauguin applied to No te aha oe riri (Why Are You Angry?) (cat. 90), painted five years earlier. MA-XRF might prove useful in revealing if anything had been painted underneath the white. Samples taken close to the edges revealed nothing.\n\nIt is possible Gauguin used the sludge from the bottom of his brush-cleaning turpentine. This would account for the great variety of pigments: zinc white, lead white, calcium-based white including calcium fluoride (mineral fluorite), iron oxide brown, vermilion, red lake with aluminum and phosphorus substrate, and ultramarine blue, and aluminum silicate ([glossary:SEM/EDX]). See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 7, 2016, on file in Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis same technique can be found in Gauguin\u2019s Te raau rahi (The Big Tree) from 1891 (cat. 27). In that painting he painted the dog over the same shade of green.\n\nSee Federica Pozzi, \u201cGaug\\_PolyWoman\\_1927\\_460\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Mar. 18, 2014, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. PLM found the addition of cadmium yellow in the brown, which was also found in the baby\u2019s orange cloth. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1927\\_460\\_Gauguin\\_Polynesian\\_Woman\\_analytical\\_report, \u201c June 7, 2016, on file.\n\nDigital recolorization imaged by Kelly Keegan, Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago. The adjusted appearance of faded areas has been inferred from the unfaded color along the edges of the painting and color visible near or within losses and in cross sections. This digital image is intended as an aid to visualization and is not a definitive reconstruction of the painting\u2019s original appearance, as variations in the concentration of the fugitive color throughout the background cannot be ascertained with the available technology.\n\nThe areas where deep blue remains would have been dark-purple shadows, and lighter blues were likely to be more violet purple half-shadows or lavender highlights, depending on the amount of red lake in the mixture. The light pinks, with no blue are still likely to be the highlights, such as the long front fold down the lower region. The strong vermilion red spots were probably a warmer dark violet shadow or perhaps have remained virtually unchanged.\n\nFor an earlier example of such a motif, see Vahine no ti vi (Woman of the Mango) (1892; Baltimore Museum of Art [W 449]).\n\nXRF identified the following pigments in the dark blue of the skirt: emerald green, vermilion, cobalt blue, iron-containing pigments, chromium-containing pigments, barium sulphate, and calcium compounds. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cGaug\\_PolyWoman\\_1927\\_460\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Mar. 18, 2014, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGauguin\u2019s wiping can easily be mistaken for cleaning abrasion during restoration. However, it is usually possible to find a spot where the abrasion passes below another translucent layer, signifying that it was already there when the top translucent layer was added.\n\nGauguin treated the background in a similar manner in his Woman with a Fan (1902; Museum Folkwang Essen [W 609]), illustrated in this entry.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, zinc white, chrome yellow, iron oxide yellow, vermilion, red lake, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, Prussian blue, emerald green, viridian, carbon black and (PLM); cadmium yellow. lead white, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, emerald green, cadmium yellow, barium sulfate, aluminum silicate, calcium carbonat, possible chrome yellow, and possible iron oxide (electron microprobe analysis); lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, silicates, emerald green, vermilion, viridian, possible chrome yellow, and barium sulfate (SEM/EDX); lead white, zinc-containing pigment (possible zinc white), vermilion, copper-containing pigments (including emerald green), iron-containing pigments (including iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow, and burnt umber), chromium-containing pigments (such as viridian and chrome yellow), cobalt blue, cadmium yellow, calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and barium sulfate (XRF). The red lake pigment in three samples was identified as a cochineal-based lake by SERS. A tin substrate was identified for the red lake by SEM/EDX. A second red lake has also been determined present based on differences in fluorescence under ultraviolet, as well as based on the identification of an aluminum and phosphorus substrate by SEM/EDX on the bright-pink fluorescing red lake particles. However, this particular lake was not identified.
