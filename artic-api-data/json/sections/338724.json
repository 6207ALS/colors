R. Way, or Rosalind Birnie Philip. There is no compelling reason to question their traditional identification as Beatrix Whistler and her sister Ethel Birnie Philip. The setting is the drawing room of the Whistlers\u2019 Paris home at 110, rue du Bac, where Beatrix reclines in a chair similar to the one depicted in La Belle Dame endormie (cat. 108). She supports her head on a small pillow, as she did when posing for both La Robe rouge (cat. 107) and La Belle Dame endormie. All three lithographs convey Beatrix\u2019s fatigue and lassitude, early symptoms of the fatal cancer that would be diagnosed a few months later.\n\nThe first mention of this lithograph in the surviving correspondence between Whistler and his printers occurs in a letter the artist wrote in early October 1894, after receiving the initial proofs of the image from London (letter 125). In that letter he referred to \u201cthe three drawings before\u201d (cat. 106, cat. 107, and cat. 108) and \u201cthis last, of the two ladies.\u201d He was extremely enthusiastic about the results he had obtained in La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle (cat. 106), La Robe rouge, and La Belle Dame endormie, the three transfer lithographs that immediately preceded The Sisters, and he ordered large sets of impressions of all three images. He was dissatisfied with the initial proofs of The Sisters, however, and wrote that he wanted \u201conly three more printed now\u201d because he planned to make alterations on the stone. Whistler did eventually make numerous small corrections to the image, probably doing so either when he and Trixie visited London between December 1894 and March 1895 for medical consultations or when they returned to England for good in September 1895. His alterations were certainly completed by December 1895; an impression of The Sisters purchased by A. H. Studd (now in the British Museum, London) from Whistler\u2019s exhibition at the Fine Art Society shows the image in its final state.\n\nWhen the artist\u2019s estate was inventoried in 1903, forty-six impressions of The Sisters were found, more than half of them signed. As in the case of La Belle Dame endormie, Whistler seems to have withdrawn this image from circulation and sale, possibly because of its painful association with his wife\u2019s illness. Whistler\u2019s desire to withhold the lithographs during his lifetime no doubt also influenced Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s decision to have the two stones destroyed without posthumous reprintings.\n\nThe image, as originally drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal and transferred to stone, has heavy outlines that have not yet been modified by scraping. Two impressions of the first state\u2014in private collections in New York and Paris\u2014include the inscription cot\u00e9 coll\u00e9 (or cot\u00e9 all\u00e9), inverted, at upper right within the image area (\"Whistler-Way Correspondence,\" letter 107, fig. 1). In these proofs, a small smudge mark is also visible just above the inscription at the edge of the stone. The inscription and smudge do not appear in the other first-state impressions examined in the preparation of this catalogue.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove Japanese vellum (210 \u00d7 311 mm), signed.

The Paris impression bears the additional inscription, in another hand, a first proof before touching.\n\nDelicate scraping of the stone is visible across the lower part of the diagonal line formed by Beatrix Whistler\u2019s crossed leg, skirt, and raised foot beneath the table. There is also scraping on her other foot and across the dark hem of her skirt to the right, next to the ruffle at the bottom of the armchair. Scraping appears across the outline of her right wrist and sleeve, and selectively within the folds of her skirt, in her collar, and within her hair. Ethel\u2019s hair and sleeve have been scraped as well, and delicate scraping has lightened her left cheekbone, clarified her right jawline, and modified the dark area under her chin. The outline of Beatrix\u2019s head, along with several stray marks on her forehead, has been lightly erased, and slight erasure has shortened her eyebrow. The outline emphasizing Ethel\u2019s left elbow and the double contour of her lower left arm have been partially removed.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory wove proofing paper (255 \u00d7 319 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (210 \u00d7 297 mm), signed.

More recently, Margaret MacDonald identified them as Ethel and Rosalind Birnie Philip, without elaborating; MacDonald (1988), p. 35. However, Pennell\u2019s earlier information would seem to be correct in this case. Ethel had already appeared half a dozen times in Whistler\u2019s lithographs by the time he drew The Sisters, whereas Rosalind seems not to have modeled for a lithograph until late 1895 or 1896. The reclining figure, so close in pose to the two preceding lithographs (cat. 107 and cat. 108), is almost certainly Beatrix, whose health was beginning to deteriorate in this period. In fact, it is possible that The Sisters was drawn as a kind of reprise of an earlier double portrait of Ethel and Beatrix, The Duet (cat. 104). When proofs of The Duet failed to meet Whistler\u2019s expectations, the artist wrote to T. R. Way that he intended to \u201cdo another of the same subject\u201d; letter 120.\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 44.\n\nCreases inherent to the transfer paper, spaced 85 mm apart, run horizontally through the image (see also cat. 107, cat. 108, cat. 110, cat. 111, cat. 112, and cat. 115). The more visible line runs across the bodice of Ethel\u2019s gown, approximately 5 mm below her chin, and a much less visible line runs through Beatrix\u2019s skirt, 28 mm from the bottom of the image.\n\nT. R. Way (1896, 1905) assigned the number 71 to the second, final state, designating the first-state proofs under the number 71a. Levy (1975) erroneously reproduced a first-state impression as Way 71 (Levy 105) and a second-state impression as Way 71a (Levy 106).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 109, first state.
