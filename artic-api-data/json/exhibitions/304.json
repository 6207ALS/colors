    "short_description": "Beginning in the last quarter of the 18th century, handkerchiefs and bandanas were issued to celebrate important events and personages of various kinds. The popularity of commemorative kerchiefs grew with the introduction of copper-plate printing, which accelerated the process and decreased the cost. These kerchiefs illustrate many aspects of social and economic life, and their appeal was widespread throughout all levels of society.",
