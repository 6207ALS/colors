    "description": "<p>Join Chicago clarinetist, composer, and \u201cspiritual jazz soothsayer\u201d Angel Bat Dawid for the premiere of her new composition \"Peace: A Suite for Skylanding, A Mended Petal Odyssey.\" Commissioned by the Art Institute of Chicago, Bat Dawid composed this suite in response to <em>Skylanding</em>, Yoko Ono's first permanent public sculpture in the United States, which is located in Jackson Park on Chicago's South Side. The composition also responds to Yoko Ono\u2019s <em>Mended Petal</em>, a companion work in the Art Institute's collection and on view in the museum's Pritzker Garden.</p><p>This program features a recorded performance of the piece in Jackson Park by a seven member intergenerational ensemble of South Side musicians, and a live conversation with Angel Bat Dawid about her work\u2014a musical tribute to Yoko Ono's landmark for peace and Chicago's South Side.</p><p>The program concludes with a virtual community&nbsp;gathering of musical artists who join Angel for a brief live performance&nbsp;in response to Yoko Ono's <em>Mended Petal</em>.&nbsp;Participating musicians include Damon Locks, Nicole Mitchell, Jeff Parker, Ben LaMar Gay, and Marvin Tate.</p><p><strong>About the Artist</strong><br></p><p>With a growing international presence following the release of her debut album <em>The Oracle</em>, Angel Bat Dawid has become one of the most exciting and distinct voices in Chicago's vibrant avant-jazz and improvised music scenes. Her hypnotic, intimate, and soaring compositions reflect her experiences as a black artist and bring together a range of styles including free jazz, gospel, and operatic contralto.</p><p>Artists Connect is a public series that highlights both the creative process and creative communities. Visual artists, poets, dancers, and musicians engage with works of art from the Art Institute's collection. Through a creative response, artists make connections to their own practice and inspire new ways of understanding the collection. </p><p>\"Peace: A Suite for Skylanding, A Mended Petal Odyssey\" is presented in partnership with the Chicago Park District as part of the series Night Out in the Parks.</p><p>Support for this program is provided in part by the Woman\u2019s Board of the Art Institute of Chicago and Chuck Thurow.</p><p>Closed captioning will be available for this program.
