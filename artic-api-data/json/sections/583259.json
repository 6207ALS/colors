Cup fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves a segment of the outsplayed rim and double carinated profile. The mosaic pattern is formed from sections of two canes: one in an aquamarine ground with a yellow spiral and central dot. The second, more predominant cane in an amethyst ground, a white central dot with a concentric red ring surrounded by a ring of nine yellow dots in turn surrounded by a thin white ring.\n\nThe longest edge preserves the rim; three sides are broken and all retain a light-brown incrustation. One edge has a thick weathering crust and some brilliant iridescence; the interior is repolished.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 84 Fragment of a Cup, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
