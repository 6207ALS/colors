    "description": "<p>Physiologist \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey\u2019s lifelong fascination with bodily movement led him to develop what he called \u201cchronophotography\u201d\u2014meaning \u201cphotography of time\u201d\u2014a process that may have influenced the locomotion studies of Eadweard Muybridge, which are generally better known. To create his chronophotographs, Marey modified an ordinary camera by placing a rotating metal disk with multiple slots cut at regular intervals behind the lens and leaving the lens open. As the subject moved in front of a dark background, the disk acted as a shutter, exposing a sequence of images on a single photographic plate. As a member of the Acad\u00e9mie Nationale de M\u00e9dicine, Marey likely made this view of a bicyclist as part of a campaign to develop sports attire that would maximize comfort and minimize fatigue. Cubist, Futurist, and Dada artists all looked to Marey\u2019s work as they attempted to picture the interdependence of space and time formulated by Albert Einstein.</p>\n",
