    "description": "<p>The daguerreotype was invented in France in 1839 but gained its longest-lived popularity in America, where it was prized for its faithful detail and affordability. In the 1850s especially, millions of daguerreotypes were made by &quot;operators&quot; who rapidly learned the technique\u2014involving copper plates coated in silver, each producing a unique image\u2014to fulfill burgeoning demand for portraits. The seated elderly couple shown here holds a note identifying their ages and the occasion for the image, their 50th wedding anniversary: &quot;70 years, 2 months, 20 days. / 68 years, 3 months, 21 days. / THANKS BE TO GOD: / Oct. 11th, 1802 Marriage Jubilee, Oct. 11th, 1852.&quot; Lateral reversal through the camera lens caused all writing in daguerreotypes to appear backwards, while the fineness of the metal plate gave jewel-like precision and great tonal range to the images. These qualities prompted viewers to nickname the daguerreotype &quot;mirror with a memory.&quot;</p>\n",
