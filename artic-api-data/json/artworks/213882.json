    "description": "<p>As one of many new manufacturers competing in a vast marketplace, George W. Shiebler began producing silver in the early 1870s. Although Shiebler\u2019s firm was better known for its decorative flatware and silver jewelry, this bowl showcases the firm\u2019s inventive design and dexterous handling of hollowware, which was made in more limited production. The intricate handle is formed of entwined branches and leaves, plums, and copper cherries, with three applied insects\u2014a fly, a beetle, and a spider\u2014further enhancing the object\u2019s lifelike quality. While the vessel was inspired by Japanese naturalism, which was popular among American silver firms of the Aesthetic movement, the realistic details also reference John Ruskin\u2019s belief that truth and beauty emerged from nature. Interestingly, the bowl is stamped with several French import marks, indicating that its American owner brought the bowl into France.</p>\n",
