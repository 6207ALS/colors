She was captivated by the stark elegance of the bones and shipped some back to New York so she could paint them the following year. She noted, \u201cTo me they are as beautiful as anything I know. . . . The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert.\u201d O\u2019Keeffe\u2019s inclusion of the calico fabric roses\u2014which were used to decorate graves in New Mexico\u2014further evokes questions of life, death, and mortality.</p>\n",
