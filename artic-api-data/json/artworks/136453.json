Horus continued to be revered through the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. Each Egyptian king was considered to be the \u201cLiving Horus on Earth.\u201d The king would often wear a double crown, which symbolized rule over both Northern and Southern Egypt. Here Horus is shown wearing such a crown,confirming the king\u2019s shared identity with the god. Behind Horus is the disk of the sun, protected by a uraeus, a snake symbolizing royalty, from which hangs an ankh, the sign for life.</p>\n",
