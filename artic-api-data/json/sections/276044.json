Ethel, who would have been twenty-nine years old when the lithographs were executed, also sat for a number of oils and watercolors. A seemingly unique proof of this lithograph in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, shows that Whistler first made a sketch with the transfer paper oriented horizontally and then turned the paper to draw the present image on top. In the second state, all but the slightest traces of the first sketch have been scraped from the stone; however, the marks of this first drawing that do remain visible in the second state could not have been removed without disturbing the final image.\n\nWhistler always welcomed publicity for his work and readily agreed when he was asked to submit a group of new lithographs to The Whirlwind, a weekly periodical being launched by Stuart Erskine and Herbert Vivian. Witty, urbane, and politically reactionary, the journal issued a series of line reproductions after well-known contemporary paintings, including two of Whistler\u2019s oils. The Winged Hat, published in the October 25 issue, was the first of his lithographs to appear under the heading \u201cMr Whistler\u2019s \u2018Songs on Stone,\u2019\u201d and was heralded by Vivian with the following remarks: \u201cWe publish today the first of this series of Lithographs that comes to us from Chelsea. The Master, in bestowing upon us these priceless pearls, was of the opinion that they would find their way inevitably to their usual audience! Still\u2014for the sake of \u2018The Rare Few\u2019\u2014we persevere.\u201d\n\nThe Ways printed the large periodical edition of The Winged Hat from supplementary stones in order to preserve the original stone for Whistler\u2019s own use. The retransfer of the image to additional stones was apparently completed by October 10; an impression in the British Museum, London, is inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Oct 10th. Mrs. W\u2019s Sister, and Retransferred + printed for Whirlwind.\n\nThe Winged Hat was one of two images selected by T. R. Way for printing during a demonstration and lecture on lithography that he presented to the Art Workers\u2019 Guild in May 1893 (see also cat. 18). An impression bearing the graphite inscription Art Worker\u2019s Guild 5.5.93 / Lecture on Lithography by Way identifies this image as the \u201cfigure subject\u201d mentioned in the Pennells\u2019 (1921) description of the program.\n\nA preliminary drawing perpendicular to the figure is visible. Registration marks appear 32 mm above and 49 mm below the image.\n\nGlasgow: HAG, ivory wove proofing paper (342 \u00d7 259 mm).\n\nMost of the preliminary drawing has been removed from the stone. Registration marks have also been erased. Evidence of the preliminary drawing is more apparent in some impressions than others; the original lines began to strengthen as the stone was repeatedly inked and printed.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream laid paper (260 \u00d7 207 mm), signed, and inscribed, in Whistler\u2019s hand, \u201cSongs on Stone\u201d\u2014Proof; Palmer, tan laid paper (308 \u00d7 241 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (3), grayish ivory laid proofing paper (265 \u00d7 215 mm) laid down on grayish ivory laid proofing paper (278 \u00d7 214 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (279 \u00d7 203 mm); cream Japanese paper (308 \u00d7 209 mm). London: BM, ivory wove proofing paper (283 \u00d7 218 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, Oct 10th. Mrs. W\u2019s Sister, and Retransferred + printed for Whirlwind. Washington: FGA, cream Japanese paper (310 \u00d7 210 mm); LC, cream wove paper (285 \u00d7 222 mm); NGA, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 208 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Cleveland, CMA (2); and New York, MMA.\n\nPublished edition. Impressions for The Whirlwind were printed by machine from supplementary stones on smooth, ivory wove paper, often discolored to cream, in a somewhat blacker and shinier ink than that used for the hand-pulled proofs; Whirlwind impressions are therefore generally higher in contrast. Somewhat unusually, a printed legend was not added.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory wove paper (284 \u00d7 225 mm); ivory wove paper (283 \u00d7 224 mm). Glasgow: HAG (2), ivory wove paper (285 \u00d7 222 mm); ivory wove paper (284 \u00d7 224 mm).\n\nRemarks: Other periodical impressions are found in Cambridge, Mass., FAM; Cleveland, CMA; New York, MMA and NYPL; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.

Whistler frequently depicted his sister-in-law in fashionable attire. He took great pains to render certain extravagant details of her clothing, such as the feather boa in the watercolor, and the hat and gloves in the lithographs (cat. 34, cat. 35).\n\nKennedy (1914) described this state as follows: \u201cThere is an early state with scribbling in the left background.\u201d Kennedy may have learned of the existence of a first state from T. R. Way before the printer\u2019s death in 1913. In fact, the preliminary drawing is more extensive than Kennedy suggested; in addition to the \u201cscribbling in the left background\u201d there are lines crossing the lap of the sitter, near her left hand, and behind her shoulders on the right.\n\nSidney Starr\u2019s wood-engraved reproductions of Whistler\u2019s oil paintings At the Piano (YMSM 24; Taft Museum, Cincinnati) and Harmony in Pink and Gray: Portrait of Lady Meux (YMSM 229; The Frick Collection, New York) appeared in The Whirlwind 1, no. 7 (9 August 1890), p. 104, and no. 12 (13 September 1890), p. 184, respectively.\n\nSee cat. 18, esp. n. 1.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 34, second state.
