    "description": "<p>Join the Art Institute's Pritzker Chair of Arts of Asia and curator of Chinese art Tao Wang for a discussion of two newly acquired Chinese moon flasks.</p><p>Though created centuries apart, the Ming Dynasty <em>Yongle Moon Flask</em> (early 15th century) and Fu Yiyao's <em>The Essence of Light and the Cadence of Rhythm</em> (2010) share striking similarities. Wang provides a closer look at both in this lecture, delving into the history and cultural significance of the moon flask.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong>&nbsp;In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination, though anyone who would like to wear a mask is encouraged to do so.&nbsp;If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 in the week before your visit, we ask that you stay home.&nbsp;We appreciate your help in keeping the museum a healthy and safe place for our staff and visitors.
