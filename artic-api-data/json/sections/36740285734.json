The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. A warp-thread match was detected with seven other Monet paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 1933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37 [W1628], inv. 1933.441), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The artist worked from an initial lay-in, building up the final composition in a network of open brushstrokes that includes both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint application. The painting is densely worked up and includes significant compositional changes: either the stack was moved from a more central placement to its final position on the left side of the painting, or possibly two overlapping stacks were included at an earlier stage of the composition. Alterations were also made to the position of the horizon. Two small areas of bright emerald green paint exposed at the surface of the painting\u2014one near the top of the wheat stack, the other below the building at far right\u2014indicate that the earlier composition incorporated some bright, more colorful hues. The artist appears to have wiped or scraped localized areas of the painting when the upper layers were still relatively soft, leading to tiny areas of abrasion and interlayer cleavage between upper and lower paint layers and exposing the underlying layers at the surface.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 32.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 91 (lower left, in light red paint)(fig. 32.2). The signature and date were added when the underlying paint layers were already dry (fig. 32.3).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the painting were approximately 64 \u00d7 92 cm. This corresponds closely to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas (65 \u00d7 92 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 21.9V (0.7) x 23.6H (0.6) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was determined with seven other Monet paintings: The Petite Creuse River (cat. 25 [W1231], inv. 1922.432), Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer) (cat. 27 [W1269], inv. 1985.1103), Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28 [W1270], inv. 1933.444), Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431), Sandvika, Norway (cat. 34 [W1397], inv. 1961.790), Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist) (cat. 36 [W1475], inv. 1933.1156), and Water Lily Pond (cat. 37 [W1628], inv. 1933.441).\n\nThere is mild cusping along the left and right edges, slightly stronger cusping along the top edge, and more pronounced cusping along the bottom edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to preacquisition lining (see Conservation History); tacks spaced 2.5\u20135 cm apart. Most of the original tack holes were reused when the canvas was restretched after lining, with additional tacks added in between (fig. 32.4). Along the left edge, there are seven old tack holes that do not correspond to the cusping. There are a few old tack holes, located at or close to the canvas edges (some torn or cut through), mainly seen on the right edge (fig. 32.5). Some additional pinholes, which pass through the canvas and into the stretcher, appear to be more recent. A separate set of tacks (underneath the original tacking margins) attaches the lining canvas tacking edges to the stretcher (i.e., the tacking edges were separated after lining and tacked down separately). The lining canvas tacks are visible in the X-ray, and the impression of the tack head is visible through the original tacking edge in places. The edges of the canvas sometimes turn over the back edge of the stretcher. Based on marks impressed in the canvas in a few places, it appears that canvas pliers were used to stretch the canvas at some point.\n\nOriginal stretching: The original tack holes are spaced 5\u20139 cm apart; as noted above, it appears that most of the original tack holes were reused when the painting was restretched after lining (see Conservation History). The original tack holes appear to correspond to the cusping pattern on all sides.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher may be the original stretcher. The stretcher is six-membered with vertical and horizontal crossbars, and keyable mortise and tenon joints; all keys (twelve) are present. Stretcher depth: Approximately 2 cm at outer edge (inner, nonbevelled edge is closer to 2.5 cm) (fig. 32.6).\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of the top, left, and right tacking margins but stops short of the bottom edge (fig. 32.7). This suggests that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric on the top, left, and right sides; the bottom edge probably corresponds to the edge of the larger roll of canvas that was attached to the frame during priming. The canvas was probably commercially primed. The ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 10 to 60 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 32.8).\n\nThe ground is off-white with some dark particles visible under magnification (fig. 32.9).\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following components: lead white, calcium carbonate (chalk), traces of iron oxide and bone black, silica, various silicates, and alumina. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting was heavily worked up as evidenced by its relatively dense appearance in the X-ray. This is largely due to significant areas of compositional change and reworking, which were revealed by the technical examination (fig. 32.10). A dense buildup of brushwork to the right of the stack indicates the earlier outline of a stack further to the right. This suggests that the stack in the final painting was initially painted in a more central position and was possibly wider or more squat than in the final painting. Similar radio-opaque brushstrokes are also visible on the left side of the final stack. It is difficult to say whether this brushwork is associated with the earlier composition or whether it simply represents an adjustment to the left edge of the final stack in the course of painting. Given the distance between the left and right extremes of this earlier brushwork, however, it is also possible that there could have been two large, overlapping stacks in the original composition. Some adjustments were also made to the horizon line on both the left and right sides of the stack (fig. 32.11). Dense brushstrokes both above and below the final horizon seem to indicate that, at earlier stages in the painting process, the height of the horizon was altered, possibly several times (fig. 32.12).\n\nIn the execution of the final painting, the artist worked up the surface as a whole, using an open network of overlapping brushstrokes. The sky was laid in with a warm underlayer, which ranges in tone across the surface from pale orange-brown to off-white (fig. 32.13). Over this, more textural strokes of pale blue, green, pink, and yellow paint were applied, leaving both the underpainting and the ground layer visible in places, especially near the edges where the brushwork is more open (fig. 32.14). This underlayer does not always extend to the edges of the canvas; microscopically, it appears discontinuous in places, leaving the ground layer visible and suggesting that it was somewhat sketchy and open. The underpainting appears to have been dry when the sky was built up and the upper paint layers include both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint application, indicating that the sky was carried out in more than one session. The yellow area, near the horizon, was built up with thicker strokes of paint. This was still wet in a few places when some of the strokes of green paint from the hilltops were dragged through it. In the foreground, the artist worked from dark to light, laying in the area beneath the field with dark reddish-brown (fig. 32.15, fig. 32.16), dark purple, and dull greenish-gray tones (fig. 32.17). The upper pink, peach, and blue strokes of the field were applied in both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry layering. Final strokes of warm orange-red and yellow tones were lightly dragged across the surface, such that the brushstrokes skip over the recesses of the underlying dry paint and accentuate its surface texture (fig. 32.18). The wheat stack and the hills and buildings behind consist of fairly continuous paint applications, making it difficult to see the underlying layers. An isolated stroke of bright emerald green impasto, near the upper-left edge of the stack and which is just exposed at the surface, suggests that some brighter, more colorful tones were used in the earlier stages of building up this area (fig. 32.19). Another small area of bright green paint from an underlying layer is visible in the area of the building farthest to the right (fig. 32.20, fig. 32.21). The buildings in this area were articulated by just a few broad brushstrokes; the only architectural detail being the very fine lines of dark green paint used to delineate the eaves of the building at far right and the pale gray highlight on the edge of its roof (fig. 32.21, fig. 32.22).\n\nIt seems that the artist rubbed or scraped over areas of the painting when the upper paint layers were set up but still relatively soft, leading to tiny areas of abrasion and interlayer cleavage that expose the lower layers at the surface of the painting (fig. 32.23). There is a band of short, vertical marks in the paint, near the top edge, approximately 1 cm wide, which occurred when the paint was still wet. This could be the result of contact from an easel cleat or some kind of transporting device. In some areas, final strokes from the sky pass over these marks (fig. 32.24), indicating that they occurred while the artist was still working on the painting. Several light gouges were observed throughout the paint surface. These probably occurred as a result of handling when the paint was still soft. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint surface, as well as tiny bubble holes where the paint was more thickly applied or more heavily worked. Two unidentified inclusions in the paint layer were observed near the bottom right edge (fig. 32.25, fig. 32.26). These ridged, reddish-brown, shell-shaped objects measure approximately 2 mm in diameter and are probably composed of organic material (they appear relatively radio transparent in the X-ray). They could be plant-related materials that were incorporated into the paint layer when it was wet. There is some flattened impasto around the edges of the painting, presumably due to framing while the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes including 1.0 cm, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes).\n\nXRF analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, viridian, emerald green, cadmium yellow, one or more iron oxide pigments, vermilion. UV fluorescence of several pale-pink paint strokes suggests the use of red lake throughout the landscape. Restoration fills and retouching appear to contain titanium white and zinc white (not present in the original paint layers), and calcium compounds at higher levels than those detected in the original paint. Naples yellow and strontium yellow also appear to be associated exclusively with areas of retouching.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 1996 and left unvarnished (see Conservation History). The paint surface has a relatively dry, matte quality in most areas, with some subtle variations in surface sheen depending on the qualities of the paint application.\n\nThe painting was lined with an aqueous adhesive at some point before it was acquired in 1983. The lining, which may have preserved the original stretcher, appears to date to the early twentieth century, based on its aged appearance. The original tacking margins were preserved; those of the lining canvas were trimmed, disguising the presence of the lining canvas at the edges. The presence of a synthetic varnish at the time of acquisition suggests that other treatments (i.e., varnish removal and revarnishing) were carried out before the painting was acquired.\n\nThere are microscopic traces of retouching in localized areas consisting of a coarse, granular, greenish-gray fill material. This fill material is often associated with traces of retouching that appear to have been mostly removed in previous cleaning. Apart from a few actual small damages to the paint layer, as seen in the area of the signature and date, for example (fig. 32.27), most of these fills seem to be unrelated to actual paint loss. This is evident throughout the field area, where the fill material covers tiny areas of the dark brown underpainting exposed at breaks in the upper brushwork (fig. 32.28). The filling and retouching was probably done either for aesthetic reasons (i.e., to reduce the appearance of the brown underpainting) or because these areas were interpreted as losses in the upper paint layers (i.e., exposing more of the underpainting than the artist originally intended to be seen). To the right of the stack, where there are numerous small areas of exposed brown underpainting, there is a relatively concentrated area of the fill material. Some of these areas may exhibit tiny flake losses in the upper paint layers, but for the most part the fill was applied in areas where the dark brown underlayer was originally left more visible. In the background of the composition, there is a campaign of more broadly applied (and perhaps inventive) retouching that appears to cover well-preserved original paint. The retouching is very thinly applied using a lean, matte paint, which, microscopically, has a granular appearance. It is visible in the lighter strokes on the roof of the building farthest to the right, as well as in the area in front of the building (fig. 32.29) and in the vertical, linear \u201ctrees\u201d to the right of the stack. In this area, the retouching is slightly glossier but still consists of thin, dilute paint with coarse particles. In the yellow area of the sky, near the middle of the horizon, residues of pale yellow retouching are visible microscopically (fig. 32.30). It is possible that there was some abrasion in this area, but this seems to be related to the artist\u2019s wiping or scraping technique (see Application/technique) rather than the result of overcleaning. In general, the original paint layer is intact underneath. XRF analysis indicated the presence of titanium white in all of the areas of restoration analyzed, which would date the restoration to some time after 1920 (see Palette). The retouching is not visually disturbing and is for the most part visible only under magnification.\n\nIn 1996, a synthetic varnish layer was removed. This revealed old blanched varnish residues in the interstices of the impasto in the stack and in the hills in the center of the composition, which were removed with solvent. The earlier restorations were not removed.\n\nThe work is in good condition. The canvas is lined with an aqueous adhesive and stretched taut with no planar deformations. The original tacking margins are intact, and the work appears to retain its original stretcher. The paint layer is secure. In places, the impasto is slightly flattened and moated, likely as a result of the lining process. There are small areas of damage and paint loss around the signature and date and in a few places along the bottom edge. These areas were restored (probably at an early date) using a generic coarse, greenish-gray fill material. In general, the retouching, which remains most visibly in the signature (cross of t) and date (top of 1), appears to have been mostly removed, probably in subsequent cleanings, with only traces visible in some areas under the microscope. Additional localized areas of the same fill (with only traces of retouching) are visible microscopically throughout the foreground. These are unrelated to damage and appear to have been applied to block out areas of the dark brown underpainting that had originally been left visible through breaks in the brushwork. A more liberal campaign of retouching over well-preserved original paint appears to have been carried out in the area of the buildings, hills, and sky on the right side of the stack. The retouching paint is thinly applied and appears granular, lean, and matte. The inpainting of a loss near the right side of the group of hills, just above the buildings, appears somewhat mismatched. There is a general network of light, mechanical cracks, with localized areas of drying cracks within the stack. Gold residues from the frame are present along the top and bottom edges, and there are some accretions in the upper-right corner of the painting. Yellowed varnish residues are visible in the recesses of the paint texture. The work is currently unvarnished and has a dry, matte surface with subtle variations in gloss depending on the qualities of the paint.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a reproduction of a Louis XIII convex frame with carved alternating acanthus and stylized leaves, plain hollow, and continuous ribbon bordered by a leaf-tip sight molding (Paul Mitchell Ltd., London 1995). The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso. The hollow is burnished, with selective burnishing and a heavier rub on the carved ornament. The toning is heavy with final washes of umber and gray with dark flecking. The carved jelutong molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetail splines. The molding from perimeter to interior, is fillet; ogee cyma recta side; convex face with carved alternating acanthus and stylized leaves; hollow; torus carved with continuous ribbon; and cove with carved leaf-tip sight molding (fig. 32.31).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1983; removed in 1995): The work was previously housed in a reproduction Louis XV frame, gilt, with swept sides and foliate rocaille cartouches with fleur-de-lis centers.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Hamman, Paris, as agent for Knoedler and Company, New York, Sept. 1891.\n\nSold at the Knoedler, New York, sale, Chickering Hall, New York, Apr. 11, 1893, lot 77, to Durand-Ruel, New York, and Boussod, Valadon et Cie., Paris, in half-shares, for 6,000 francs.\n\nHalf share sold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Sept. 30, 1899 or Nov. 13, 1899.\n\nHalf share sold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Boussod, Valadon et Cie., Paris, May 27, 1903.\n\nAcquired by Rosenberg, Paris, 1903.\n\nSold by Rosenberg, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Jan. 11, 1908.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Nov. 11, 1915 or Dec. 9, 1915.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Andr\u00e9 Weil, Paris, Jan. 9, 1948.\n\nAcquired by Wildenstein, New York and Paris, by 1982.\n\nSold by Wildenstein, New York and Paris, to Mrs. Mercedes Eraso de Rodr\u00edguez Landaeta, Caracas, Venezuela, by 1982.\n\nAcquired by Rachel Adler Fine Art, New York, by Aug. 1982.\n\nSold by Rachel Adler Fine Art, New York, to James Goodman Gallery, New York, Aug. 1982.\n\nSold by James Goodman Gallery, New York, to Stephen Hahn Gallery, New York, Feb. 7, 1983.\n\nHalf share sold by Stephen Hahn Gallery, New York, to Acquavella Galleries, New York, Feb. 7, 1983.\n\nSold by Acquavella Galleries, New York, to Mr. Daniel C.

Wood and Douglas Druick; see Tracie Nappi, European Painting, Art Institute of Chicago, memo, March 26, 1996, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. This range includes the inscribed date of 1891 and allows for the possibility that Monet began the painting in 1890.\n\nFor further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet's paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination, indicates that the paint mixture includes vermilion and lead white; other pigments may also be present in the mixture. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stacks\\_83\\_166\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was identified by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1983\\_166\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 27, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset), Claude Monet, 1890\u20131891 (W1284/1983.166),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1231, W1269, W1270, W1278, W1284, W1397, W1475, W1628,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res Canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe construction and patina suggest that the stretcher is original or was added early in the painting\u2019s lifetime.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including aqueous lining.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. Several lead clusters were also observed in the ground. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1983\\_166\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 27, 2014; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stacks\\_83\\_166\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis technique of working from darker to lighter tones is unique among the Art Institute Stacks. This seems to be intentional (i.e., part of the artist\u2019s working method), to impart a darker, subdued tonality to the lighter, more colorful strokes applied over the top, rather than a change in color scheme, as seen in other Art Institute works, Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155) and Stack of Wheat (cat. 31 [W1283], inv. 1983.29).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, viridian, emerald green, cadmium yellow, one or more iron oxide pigments, and vermilion (XRF). XRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_166\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 72\u201375.\n\nThe original paint in the area of the signature and date looks like it has been gouged to different degrees (i.e., upper paint layers only in some places and down to the canvas in others). This damage is visible in the X-ray.\n\nThese areas of retouching are directly over the original paint and do not include the coarse fill material described above. It is uncertain whether this retouching was done at the same time as those fills; there is little retouching left from the fill campaign to compare the qualities of the retouching.\n\nThe trees on the left side of the stack, on the other hand, appear to be original: no titanium was detected with XRF, and the paint looks similar to the original paint and is intimately bonded with the underlayers.\n\nSee Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Stack\\_83\\_166\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 9, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Frank Zuccari, treatment report, Sept. 5, 1996, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nKirk Vuillemot, \u201cMonet Frame Descriptions Final,\u201d Dec. 3, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nKirk Vuillemot, \u201cMonet Frame Descriptions Final,\u201d Dec. 3, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAccording to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 3, Nos. 969\u20131595 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 495, cat. 1284 (ill.); 501.
