The design for Gustavus Babson\u2019s second Oak Park home includes many markers of Prairie School style. The large, horizontally planned house features a strong asymmetrical composition, a gabled roof, and bands of narrow windows, as seen in these working drawings. Although their work was not as geometrically daring as Wright\u2019s, Tallmadge and Watson left their own unique imprint on the quiet streets of Oak Park.</p>\n",
