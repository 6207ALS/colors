    "description": "<p>Here Marin emphasized the colors, shapes, and textures that differentiate the various pines found along the Maine coast. A particularly gnarled, distorted tree moves with the frenetic energy of a dancer, while its companions rattle and sway in the breeze. Marin combined his hieroglyphic mark making with a carefully orchestrated color palette: rays of yellow sun warm the horizon, while touches of bright red-orange lead the eye into space. Again defying tradition, he used charcoal wash to darken and muddy the red tones of the clustered trees in the middle ground. He painted over heavy charcoal lines, smearing the particles to create a dark haze. Juxtaposing complexity of line with an unusually direct application of color, the artist captured a sensation of life in motion that is joyful, almost spiritual.</p>\n",
