    "short_description": "Chris Raschka\u2019s books beg to be read out loud. Bits of paper, splashes of paint, and zig-zag and twirling lines create pictures and texts that pop and sing together like the punctuated rhythms of poetry. Raschka maneuvers a brush or oil crayon with skill and swiftness, creating characters that weave through colors and shapes and dance upon the open background of a stage-like setting.",
