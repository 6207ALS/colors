    "title": "The Medici, Michelangelo, and the Art of Late Renaissance Florence",
    "description": "This major international exhibition provides a detailed survey of the art of Florence during the years that Michelangelo and artists employed by the first Medici grand dukes\u2014such as Cellini, Bronzino, and Pontormo\u2014produced celebrated masterpieces. Works by these artists bolstered the worldly power and status of the ruling family and reflected the sophistication and refinement of Florentine court circles, in which high value was placed upon classical aesthetics and scientific learning. Many of the 200 objects in the exhibition\u2014including sculpture, painting, armor, medals, porcelain, and tapestries\u2014have never before traveled out of Florence. Among the objects on view for the first time in the United States are three sculptures by Michelangelo, some of the greatest paintings of the Uffizi and Pitti Galleries, and works from the famed Studiolo (treasure room) of Francesco I in the Palazzo Vecchio.",
