Still, the artist was unhappy with <em>Fourteenth Stone</em> as published. Although she settled upon white ink on black paper for the final published print, she explained, \u201cI wasn\u2019t happy with the color. It wasn\u2019t what I wanted. I should have said, \u2018Just do it in black and white. Let it sit up as a strong black and white.\u2019 I remember seeing it after and saying, \u2018Well, it\u2019s as good as it can be. It\u2019s done.\u2019\u201d Nonetheless, <em>Fourteenth Stone</em> is among Bontecou\u2019s subtlest and most evocative prints.</p>\n",
