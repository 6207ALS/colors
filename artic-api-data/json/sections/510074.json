Salvius Otho, an old friend of Nero, was proclaimed imperator by the Praetorian Guard, who then promptly murdered the current holder of the title, Galba. The Senate obligingly handed Otho the usual honors: they acknowledged him Augustus and Caesar, and gave him tribunician power, as the obverse inscription tells. Otho needed money fast to pay troops to fight off the next rival for the throne, Vitellius. The mint in Rome immediately got to work. The reverses of Otho\u2019s gold and silver are desperately, almost hysterically, optimistic: they call for peace on all the lands of earth (pax orbis terrarum), victory (victoria), abundant food (Ceres), domestic bliss (Vesta), and as on this coin, Security for the Roman people (Securitas P[opuli] R[omani]). According to Tacitus, Otho committed suicide to avoid dragging out the civil war. He reigned three months.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Tacitus, Histories 2.47\u201348.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 43 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Otho, A.D. 69\n\n</section>",
