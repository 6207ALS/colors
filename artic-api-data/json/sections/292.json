Although he did create many winter landscapes\u2014see, for example, Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3)\u2014beginning in 1869 and continuing throughout the rest of his career, none of them represents the effect of snow on such a complex landscape setting. Its title at its first known exhibition helps solve the problem of what exactly is being represented: it was labeled La Garenne \u00e0 Pontoise (Rabbit Warren at Pontoise) in the Pissarro retrospective held at Durand-Ruel, Paris, in January and February 1892. As this work shows, rabbit warrens, especially old and well-developed wild ones, are visually chaotic and, especially under the cover of snow, could be mistaken for part of the natural terrain. They were generally constructed by animals that lived in the wild. A rabbit warren would, however, only be considered such under the law if the landowner on whose property it was found planned on breeding the rabbits; otherwise it was merely a large \u201crabbit complex.\u201d Pissarro evidently knew this particular warren, which was not far from his family\u2019s house on the quai du Pothuis in Pontoise.\n\nThis is certainly an odd subject for a painting. Some precedents exist, namely two engravings by F\u00e9lix Bracquemond (fig. 8.1 and fig. 8.2). Whereas Bracquemond\u2019s two images convey the animals\u2019 ultimate fate, Pissarro\u2019s depiction contains no signs of the animals at all. The lone figure on the right may represent the breeder, and the colossal mound dominating most of the composition is presumably the warren. So, then, why did the artist choose to paint this subject, particularly in winter? Sadly, no answer can be found in his correspondence\u2014indeed only four letters from 1879 are published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s five-volume compilation of his correspondence. Yet these make clear that Pissarro was at one of the lowest points of his life as a working artist, literally begging for money from friends, asking for loans, or proposing sales of works at incredibly low prices; the only sales of paintings from that year recorded in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 were to Gustave Caillebotte and Paul Gauguin, both of whom were effectively subsidizing the Pissarro family. This image of privation\u2014of mere survival\u2014has to be considered in light of the painter\u2019s developing anarchism, with its complete repudiation of both capitalism and most forms of government.\n\nIndeed, two of the writers whom Pissarro read most often in these years were the French geographer and anarchist Elis\u00e9e Reclus and the Russian anarchist Peter Kropotkin, then living in England. Both of these men wrote about life in rural communities; Kropotkin was particularly interested in the small-scale farms in the \u00cele-de-France, where Pissarro lived. It is not difficult to imagine the down-on-his-luck painter, who was supporting a growing family in Pontoise, thinking about wild rabbits living in their warrens and meditating on the relationship between these animals and the humans living nearby in the small houses clinging to the hillsides. His decision to paint these two communities in winter, the most difficult of seasons, is surely not accidental, and by titling the picture The Rabbit Warren, Pissarro drew attention to this idea of life\u2014human and animal\u2014as an attempt simply to survive collectively. Such themes surely animated the artist\u2019s thinking during the period, and this painting, among the largest he made that year, is a clear result of his socio political reflections.\n\nBecause Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow was painted in a year in which it snowed both early and late in the year, it is not possible to date it to one or the other of those winter seasons. Pissarro executed seven winter landscapes that are either dated 1879 or are datable to that year. One of the most fascinating discoveries about this work is that it was painted on top of a signed and dated portrait from 1870 (fig. 8.3). The right edge of the canvas was the bottom of the portrait, which appears to represent a female subject sitting in a three-quarter pose and wearing a large hat (fig. 8.4). Pissarro scraped the high points of the portrait and also partially covered it with an uneven coating of predominantly lead white\u2013based paint to form a ground for the new picture (fig. 8.5; see Ground application and Materials/composition in the technical report). Certain sections of the portrait were, however, painted thickly enough that they clearly had an effect on the new landscape composition, imparting an overall feeling of weight (fig. 8.6 and fig. 8.7; see Paint Application in the technical report). It is obvious from the correspondence that Pissarro lacked money in 1879, so it is possible that he reused an old work for economic reasons, among others. This was not the first time that he reused a support: the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Banks of the Marne in Winter (1866; cat. 2) and Snow in Louveciennes (1869\u201370; cat. 3) were also painted on top of previous compositions. These were also periods in Pissarro\u2019s life marked by financial strain. But why did he reuse a signed and dated painting that was nearly a decade old and transform a portrait into a landscape?\n\nHad it survived to be clearly viewed, the 1870 portrait would have been the earliest large-scale portrait of Pissarro\u2019s career. In the mid-1850s and early 1860s, he did paint small-scale portraits of his father; Julie Vellay, the woman who would become his wife in 1871; and his friend Ludovic Piette; and unnamed sitters. But these make up such a small percentage of his works that they would never be included in a Pissarro retrospective. It was not until 1872 that he seriously took up painting portraits and figure compositions again, using his immediate family as models. Unfortunately, very little can be determined about the 1870 work; the infrared image (fig. 8.8) is difficult to read because of the busy character of the overlying composition and the artist\u2019s use of infrared-absorbing pigments in the overpainting. Nonetheless, the signature and date are clearly legible, and the date reads 1870. The woman is probably not Pissarro\u2019s wife, as her face is thinner and her nose more prominent than those in representations of Julie, although at the present time this cannot be determined with certainty.\n\nIf not Madame Pissarro, then who could the sitter be? The year 1870 was among the most tumultuous in the lives of Pissarro, his growing family, and his adopted country. Due to the arrival of Prussian troops, they were forced to flee their home in Louveciennes in September and to accept the hospitality of Piette and his wife, Ad\u00e8le Levy Piette, at their farm in Brittany. The Piettes loaned Pissarro money to take his family across the British Channel to the safety of England in December 1870, after the Pissarro family had lived with them for over three months. Although there is not enough physical evidence to confirm it, it is probable that the portrait represents Ad\u00e8le Levy Piette, after whom the Pissarros named their daughter, who was born at the Piette farm in 1870. The work would thus be a gift from the grateful painter. If this is true, how and when did Pissarro get the painting back? One possibility is that Madame Piette returned the portrait in May 1878, at the same time she returned Pissarro\u2019s will, perhaps because the picture was too painful a reminder of happier times spent with her husband and the Pissarros in the 1870s. On May 17, 1878, Piette\u2019s widow sent Pissarro the will he had drawn up while staying at Montfoucault on January 3, 1875, in which he named Paul C\u00e9zanne, Ludovic Piette, and Armand Guillaumin as his executors. Another possibility in light of the artist\u2019s financial difficulties is that Piette returned the portrait in an effort to help his friend sell some works without hurting his stock of more recent paintings.\n\nLudovic Piette died in April 1878, and both his widow and Pissarro were plunged into grief. Her letters detailing her husband\u2019s death from cancer are so emotionally wrenching that they are difficult to read even today. Another possibility is that after returning to Paris following her husband\u2019s death, Madame Piette may have returned works by Pissarro that had been left at the farm, including the present portrait. We will never know why Pissarro elected to paint over the portrait. Did he consider it an unsuccessful painting? Did he not care enough about it to keep it? Or did he not want to be reminded of his friends after Piette\u2019s death? Whether any or all of these were factors in his decision, the choice to reuse the work was most likely motivated by the painter\u2019s poverty and inability to spend money on art supplies in order to keep food on the table and pay the rent.\n\nWas it possible, amid the painter\u2019s own misery over Piette\u2019s death, to find beauty and to express without affectation the depths of his suffering? If this canvas was indeed originally a portrait of Piette\u2019s wife, perhaps erasing the reminder of tragedy was Pissarro\u2019s personal coping mechanism, but in the absence of definitive proof, we can only speculate. The picture has a deft, flicking, and varied surface with literally hundreds of separate gestures, many of which were painted wet-in-wet to create pictorial spontaneity (fig. 8.9). The palette is a wonder of varied hues that collectively form dirty whites, pale grays, beiges, deep browns, and blue-grays. The miracle of the picture lies in its wresting beauty from banality by being absolutely true to the rabbit warren motif as perceived by the artist at this particular moment in his life.\n\nIt is likely that the painting was completed in the latter part of 1879, because it is large and unique enough as a composition that, had it been completed earlier, Pissarro would surely have wanted to include it in the Impressionist exhibition held in April 1879. Unlike many of the other group shows, this one was a modest success, netting each participant a profit in excess of 400 francs\u2014what would have been a princely sum to the painter and his family in Pontoise. Instead, he kept this canvas for more than a decade before allowing Durand-Ruel to include it with fifty other well-chosen paintings and twenty-one gouaches in his 1892 retrospective. The picture was actually part of Julie Pissarro\u2019s collection, as attested by a letter that the artist wrote to Octave Mirbeau on February 12, 1892, announcing his wife\u2019s arrival in Paris the day before and her desire to see her works in frames. Given the difficulty of its subject, it is not surprising that the painting failed to sell that year and returned to the family collection, where it remained until 1918. It does not seem to have had a private owner, having been sold back and forth by dealers until 1964, when it was purchased by Marshall Field and given immediately to the Art Institute of Chicago (see Provenance).\n\nThe painting has recently been given a topographically precise title by the authors of the 2005 catalogue raisonn\u00e9: The Rabbit Warren, C\u00f4te Saint-Denis at Pontoise, Effect of Snow. The hillside has been identified as the C\u00f4te Saint-Denis in L\u2019Hermitage, and the houses on the right relate to others in a considerably earlier painting. But the comparison is not compelling, and the tiny chimney at right has been mistakenly identified as belonging to the factory of Chalon et Cie. It is more likely the small chimney of the gas works in Pontoise itself. It is therefore best to retain the title Pissarro himself gave the painting in 1892, The Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">On this canvas, a commercially primed no. 20 portrait (figure) standard size, Pissarro first executed a vertically oriented half-length portrait of a female figure, apparently seated and wearing a large hat, and signed the work at the lower left. After several years, he returned to this canvas, lightly scraping back the high points of the portrait and applying a white interlayer, in part with a palette knife, that acts as a partial ground and leveling layer for the visible landscape. The landscape itself was executed in a limited number of wet-in-wet paint campaigns during which the artist varied his paint handling by using brushes of differing size, shape, and stiffness, as well as by altering the consistency of his paints. The bulk of the work appears to have been painted in one or two campaigns, with smaller details such as the tree branches and the figure at the lower right added later; small touches of almost pure white paint add definition and are among the last additions to the work. The painting is currently varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 8.10).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro / 79 (lower left corner, in blue paint) (fig. 8.11). The signature appears to have been executed wet-in-wet with the background (fig. 8.12).\n\nThe visible landscape was executed over an earlier, vertical portrait that was also signed and dated. After the portrait was done, the canvas was rotated counterclockwise for the landscape painting; the current right edge was the bottom edge of the landscape. In the portrait orientation, the work was signed at the lower left; the signature is clear, C. Pissarro, and the date appears to read 1870 (fig. 8.13). Gaps in the subsequent paint layers reveal that the signature and date were executed in very dark, possibly black, paint over a dark background (fig. 8.14).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen.\n\nThe original size is not entirely clear, since the tacking margins were removed in a previous treatment (see Conservation History); it was probably close to its current measurements, 59 \u00d7 72.1 cm. This closely corresponds to a no. 20 portrait (figure) standard size (73 \u00d7 60 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 12.3V (0.6) \u00d7 12.1H (0.4) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nAs the tacking margins were removed as part of a previous conservation campaign (see Conservation History), much information about the canvas and stretching has been lost. The warp- and weft-angle maps suggest that the work was commercially prepared, showing even cusping corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. Further evidence is visible specifically in the weft-angle map, which reveals pronounced primary cusping on the left side (fig. 8.15).\n\nCurrent stretching: The tacking margins were removed and the edges covered in paper tape in a previous treatment (see Conservation History corresponds to tacks placed 5\u20138 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher was likely added when the work was lined (see Conservation History). It is a six-member keyable stretcher with horizontal and vertical crossbars. A small piece of the original stretcher, with inscriptions and labels, has been mounted to the vertical crossbar (fig. 8.16). Depth: 2.2 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Unknown.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe work is thickly painted with none of the commercial ground left visible in the final composition. Small slivers of the ground visible around the edges of the composition suggest a tinted, single layer preparation (approximately 5\u2013120 \u00b5m thick) that moderately fills the canvas weave (fig. 8.17). Pissarro applied a white interlayer between the first and second compositions that functions as a ground for the latter. This layer primarily levels and fills the depressions of the earlier paint layers, often leaving the peaks exposed (fig. 8.18, fig. 8.19).\n\nThe ground appears to be a warm buff with dark brown, black, and yellow particles visible in cross-sectional and stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 8.20). The artist-applied interlayer is cool white, with dark particles visible in stereomicroscopic examination.\n\nThe commercial ground is predominantly lead white with minor amounts of gypsum and natural barite, in addition to chalk inclusions and trace amounts of dolomite, iron-containing earth pigments such as iron-oxide yellow, umber, silica, and aluminosilicates. The artist-applied interlayer is also predominantly lead white with trace quantities of zinc white, calcium compounds including gypsum and chalk, barium sulfate, and aluminosilicates. One sample containing this layer also contained individual particles of cobalt blue and emerald green, but it is unclear if these pigments are consistent throughout the layer. The binder in both layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nThe painting has two distinct compositions. The thickness of the paint layers and dark colors used in the background of the first composition mask any apparent underdrawing. As a result, no underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography or microscopic examination.The lack of changes in the visible composition, as well as the individual execution of each compositional element, with clear gaps between the edges of forms visible in the X-ray, suggests some type of compositional planning. Charcoal was identified in several locations throughout the work and may indicate that Pissarro executed a summary underdrawing that, remaining unfixed, was subsequently swept up into the paint layers and is not readily visible.\n\nThe artist began with the canvas in a vertical orientation and appears to have executed a portrait (fig. 8.21). In some areas, flesh tones from the figure\u2019s face are still visible amid skips in the upper paint layers (fig. 8.22). The modified infrared image shows this figure most clearly: a female figure; hints of eyes, a nose, and a mouth; and a wide-brimmed hat. The images also suggest that she may be seated and holding something in her hands. Details of the woman\u2019s costume are less certain, as many of the contours are obscured by the paint layers that comprise the landscape in the final composition. The area around the figure appears to have been painted in predominantly dark greens and browns, modulating into mauves, dull oranges, and earthy pale greens (fig. 8.23, fig. 8.24, fig. 8.25). These colors are still visible throughout the sky, the snowy foreground (fig. 8.26), and along the edges of the visible composition (fig. 8.27), but no distinct forms can be discerned. Additional forms suggesting clouds or even flowers are visible to the right of the figure in transmitted infrared; it is, however, unclear whether they relate to the portrait (perhaps set in a garden or similar leafy environment); to the visible composition; or even to a third, intermediate composition of unknown subject. In part due to the interference of the visible composition, it is not clear from the infrared images or the X-ray whether this portrait was fully realized before it was painted over, but the artist\u2019s signature at the lower left (lower right in the current orientation) suggests that the artist considered the work finished (fig. 8.28).\n\nOnce his first composition was dry, Pissarro partially scraped it down, removing the highest peaks of the earlier paint layers, before applying a thin white interlayer, which mostly settled into the depressions of the previous layers while leaving the crests exposed (fig. 8.29). Flatter areas with apparent palette-knife markings contrast with others where this white interlayer is almost frothy (fig. 8.30) or was probably lightly dabbed on with the tip of a large, soft brush and looks as if it were sponged onto the surface (fig. 8.31). Such bubbles are seen throughout the work and may indicate the use of artist additives such as casein or tempera, or of manufactured matte paints in which the pigment is ground in water before being mixed with oil. In both cases, the evaporation of water could create bubbles like these (fig. 8.32). Throughout the work, especially along the bottom, this interlayer (which barely covering the darker layers from the earlier composition) was left exposed and blends in with the snowy landscape (fig. 8.33).\n\nThe visible composition appears to have been executed in a limited number of wet-in-wet sessions, with much of the most prominent brushwork from a single session. Pinholes in the corners suggest the use of taquets bois, which may have been used to space paintings in transit between the site and the studio (fig. 8.34). In many areas, Pissarro lightly dragged a loaded brush across the surface, catching the high points of the textures from the earlier composition and application of the white interlayer (fig. 8.35). He varied the effects of his wet-in-wet paint application through the fluidity of his paints and the stiffness of his brushes: in some areas, an earlier color was picked up by the brush as he applied a new color, resulting in two-tone strokes (fig. 8.36); in other areas, fluid white paint was worked over darker and brighter hues yielding low-impasto, well-mixed strokes (fig. 8.37); these areas look markedly different from those where Pissarro used a very fine brush and left a wide variety of colors relatively unmixed on the surface (fig. 8.38). Yet other areas give the impression that paint was dragged straight from the tube across the surface with a soft brush (fig. 8.39). Finally, some areas seem to combine these varying applications in a flurry of chaotic, rather than directional, strokes (fig. 8.40). For the most part, Pissarro seems to have executed the background and allowed it to dry before bringing in the finer branches and trees over it. Although these tones appear to be largely mixed on the surface, they do not disturb the paint layers beneath (fig. 8.41). The small figure at the lower right seems to be a later addition as well, and also applied wet-in-wet, allowing several colors to mix on the surface at once (fig. 8.42). To add definition and a few final highlights, Pissarro appears to have added small touches of almost pure white as a final step (fig. 8.43).\n\nMostly soft- to medium-bristle brushes, some very fine, with strokes up to 1 cm wide.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, emerald green, viridian, chrome yellow, iron-oxide yellow and red, vermilion, red lead, cochineal lake, umber, bone black and possibly zinc yellow.\n\nPissarro\u2019s palette across the two compositions on this canvas appears fairly consistent, with many of the listed pigments present in both. The few exceptions noted in samples examined for this study appear to be minor components of the paint layers and include red lead and iron-oxide earth pigments in the portrait composition, and cobalt blue in the visible composition and/or the artist-applied interlayer. In both compositions, the artist utilized complicated mixtures often including more than five pigments; cross-sectional examination attests to the wide variety of pigments present in a single paint mixture (fig. 8.44). The flesh tones of the figure in the earlier composition, for example, were found to contain red lake, vermilion, ultramarine blue and lead and zinc whites, with traces of emerald green and possibly zinc yellow, while the green from that same composition contained emerald green, ultramarine blue, lead and zinc whites, vermilion, chrome yellow, red lead, iron-oxide earth pigments, viridian, and traces of red lake (fig. 8.45). A pale layer from the upper composition in the area of the foliage just right of center contains lead white, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, emerald green, vermilion, and red lake, with traces of zinc white.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting currently has a synthetic varnish with residues of natural resin varnish in areas of impasto. It is unclear whether the natural resin varnish was original to the painting or whether Pissarro himself would have varnished the work.\n\nThe painting was first documented prior to treatment in 1975, when it was noted to be aqueously lined (with tacking margins removed) to a six-member, non-original stretcher; \u201cgenerally overpainted\u201d; and coated with a discolored natural resin varnish. The painting was cleaned of the varnish and most of the overpaint with a combination of solvents and mechanical action and revarnished with a three-layer synethetic varnish (polyvinyl acetate AYAA isolating layer, followed by inpainting, a layer of methacrylate resin L-46 and a final coat of AYAA). The lining appears to be a double lining, with a linen interleaf, and a segment of what appears to be the original stretcher was attached to the verso of the restoration stretcher (fig. 8.46). The painting was examined again in 1994, when it was noted to have flattened paint, presumably from the lining procedure, and general craquelure throughout. As part of this examination, select areas of paper tape around the edges and the retouching present beneath were removed with a combination of solvents and mechanical action; these areas were left unretouched, as they are currently covered by the frame rebate.\n\nThe painting is in stable condition and planar, with an aqueous double lining. The tacking margins of the original and interleaf-lining canvases were removed during the lining process, and the work is attached with tacks to a six-member, keyable stretcher; paper tape covers the edges. There are localized areas of craquelure throughout and losses around the edges related to the removal of the tacking margins. Cracks are slightly open in some areas, but all areas of cracking and loss appear stable at this time. The dark background of the original portrait composition is readily visible throughout areas of the sky and foreground and has been retouched in several small areas; the visibility of this layer is enhanced through abrasion incurred during previous lining and cleaning treatments.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame (installed by 1963) is probably not original to the painting. It is a French, Louis XIV, convex, straight-sided frame with projecting corner fleurs-de-lis with cabochon cartouches connected by projecting and pierced foliate scrollwork. The centers of the frame are almost heraldic, with fleur-de-lis and cabochon cartouches balanced on each side by foliate c-scrolls topped with zoomorphic lion heads on the inside, and scroll-topped brackets with hanging bellflowers on the outside. The liner that is glued and gilded to the sight edge is a later addition. The frame has water gilding over red bole on gesso and retains some of the original gilding on the ornamented convex face, but the majority of the remaining surfaces have been altered or regilded. The carved oak moldings are mitered and joined by angled, sliding, dovetailed splines. A back frame and the fillet liner, both later additions, are glued onto the oak moldings.

[E. M\u00e9nard et Cie, 1892], p. 23, cat. 11. According to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 363, the exhibition was held Jan. 23\u2013Feb. 20, 1892. The exhibition catalogue lists February 1892.)\n\nFor rabbit warrens, see Victor Alexis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dalloz et al., Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Suppl\u00e9ment au r\u00e9pertoire m\u00e9thodique et alphab\u00e9tique de l\u00e9gislation, de doctrine et de jurisprudence, en mati\u00e8re de droit civil, commercial, criminel, administratif de droits des gens et de droit public, vol. 1 (Bureau de la jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1887), p. 789. For the rabbit warren as private property and the land owner\u2019s responsibilities in tending a warren on his land, see articles 89 and 1359 in Dalloz et al., Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale: suppl\u00e9ment au r\u00e9pertoire m\u00e9thodique et alphab\u00e9tique de l\u00e9gislation, vol. 2 (Bureau de la jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1888), pp. 335, 479.\n\nSee Victor Alexis D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Dalloz et al., Jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale: Suppl\u00e9ment au r\u00e9pertoire m\u00e9thodique et alphab\u00e9tique de l\u00e9gislation, de doctrine et de jurisprudence, en mati\u00e8re de droit civil, commercial, criminel, administratif de droits des gens et de droit public, vol. 1 (Bureau de la jurisprudence g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 1887), p. 789. This section concerns jurisprudence for homes deemed natural dwellings by their very nature. Article 20 describes rabbit warrens, which it explains can only be considered natural warrens if the animals retain their freedom\u2014that is, they cannot be kept in cages. But, probably due to population control issues, the large rabbit dwelling (which looks like an oversized mound) could only retain the designation of a \u201cwarren\u201d if it remained under the care and supervision of a rabbit keeper, thus serving as a sort of natural kennel. If it is not deemed a warren under the law, the rabbits do not belong to anyone, even if the warren sits on private land. The very large rabbit warren that Pissarro painted may have been tended by one of his neighbors for the purpose of controlled breeding. It seems that the Pissarros themselves bred rabbits, as it helped keep household costs low, especially in times of financial distress. This type of rabbit breeding likely resonated even more with Pissarro as the rabbits lived freely yet coexisted with people in the service of human needs, much like a cooperative. See Madame Camille Pissarro (Julie Vellay) to Mademoiselle Marie Meunier Paris, Wednesday, 1884, in Oaul Gachet et al., Lettres impressionnistes au Dr. Gachet et \u00e0 Murer (Grasset, 1957), pp. 24\u201325. PDRS, vol. 1, p. 137, states that Julie always kept poultry and planted her own vegetable garden to keep down household expenses. Furthermore, in a letter to \u00c9mile Zola, Pissarro spoke of breeding rabbits. See Pissarro to Zola, Paris, Sept. 21, 1872, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), pp. 77\u201378. In this letter Pissarro asked Zola if his wife would come to Pontoise and get the mother rabbit that Julie had set aside for them.\n\nSee Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro and Pontoise (Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 148\u201349, 158\u201359, 160\u201362.\n\nIn fact, landscape paintings representing rabbit warrens are so rare that no expert I contacted could think of another example.\n\nFor these four letters from 1879, see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), pp. 133\u201337. The letters from 1879 are dated May 27, June, July 7, and November 8, 1879.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 398, 400, 402\u201303, 405, 407, 409\u201311. It is clear from the provenance of some of the works listed on these pages that in order to make ends meet (or, literally \u201cmeat\u201d), Pissarro was forced to sell some works in 1879\u201380 to friends and fellow artists. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 153\u201358, for Pissarro\u2019s economic distress and Caillebotte\u2019s financial aid to his friend. For Pissarro\u2019s extreme financial distress in 1877, see Eug\u00e8ne Murer to Paul Gachet, Paris, Oct. 8, 1877, and Paris, Oct. 22, 1877, in Paul Gachet et al., Lettres impressionnistes au Dr. Gachet et \u00e0 Murer (Grasset, 1957), pp. 161\u201366.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Pissarro was writing to his son Lucien and niece Esther Isaacson in London about reading anarchist literature such as the journal Le prol\u00e9taire (The Proletarian), work by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Peter Kropotkin, commentaries on the state of French political affairs, and Louise Michel\u2019s defense after being imprisoned for her political activism. See the letters published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), pp. 211\u201312, 225, 229, 292, 368\u201370.\n\nAlthough Pissarro had not painted winter landscapes with snow since 1876, this probably has more to do with the actual snowfall in France than with the artist\u2019s mood. The same is likely true of his friend Claude Monet\u2019s winter landscapes, which have often been improperly linked to his familial and economic problems rather than simply to the fact that he painted snow when there was an abundance of snow to paint. For more on winter scenes by both Monet and Pissarro, see Charles S. Moffett, Eliza E. Rathbone, Katherine Rothkopf, and Joel Isaacson, Impressionists in Winter: Effets de neige, exh. cat. (Collection/Philip Wilson Publishers, 1998), pp. 79\u2013129 and 135\u201365.\n\nOn Pissarro\u2019s desperate financial situation in 1877\u201379, see PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 398, 400, 402\u201303, 405, 407, 409\u201311. It is clear from the provenance of some of the works listed on these pages that in order to make ends meet, Pissarro was forced to sell some works in 1879\u201380 to friends and fellow artists. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 153\u201358, for Pissarro\u2019s economic distress and Caillebotte\u2019s financial aid to his friend. For Pissarro\u2019s extreme financial distress in 1877, see Eug\u00e8ne Murer to Paul Gachet, Paris, Oct. 8, 1877, and Paris, Oct. 22, 1877, in Paul Gachet et al., Lettres impressionnistes au Dr. Gachet et \u00e0 Murer (Grasset, 1957), pp. 161\u201366.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 208, 222. The 1870 portrait underneath the Art Institute\u2019s snow scene would have been the largest painting Pissarro made between 1860 and 1872. PDRS 256 (a c. 1872 portrait of the artist\u2019s daughter Minette sitting in the garden), at 73 \u00d7 60 cm, is almost the same size, as is PDRS 281 (an 1872 portrait of Minette), at 72.5 \u00d7 59.7 cm.\n\nSee Richard R. Brettell, Pissarro\u2019s People (Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute/Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 2011), pp. 54\u201355. For the close relationship in the 1870s between the Pissarros and the Piettes, see also Joachim Pissarro, Camille Pissarro (Abrams, 1993), pp. 74\u201375, 136\u201342. See also PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 127\u201328, 133, 137, 143, 146\u201347, 152\u201353.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, p. 158. Ludovic Piette died on April 14, 1878. On May 17 of the same year, Piette\u2019s widow sent Pissarro the will he had drawn up while staying at Montfoucault on January 3, 1875, in which he named C\u00e9zanne, Piette, and Armand Guillaumin as his executors; see PDRS, vol. 1, p. 147. For Pissarro\u2019s will see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 1, 1865\u20131885 (Presses Universitaires de France, 1980), p. 97. Piette had carefully preserved the will in case a misfortune should befall his friend.\n\nThus far, no one has studied the relation between Pissarro\u2019s finances and his lack of art supplies, and their impact on his practice. This could prove to be a very interesting approach.\n\nPDRS, vol. 2, p. 223. Pissarro\u2019s portrait of Minette (PDRS 282) was given to Piette and his wife because they had no children of their own and were particularly fond of the Pissarros\u2019. Shortly after Minette\u2019s death in 1874, Piette returned this portrait to Pissarro, \u201cdoubtless thinking that after this grievous event, his friend would be glad to have her portrait by his side.\u201d Piette wrote about the shipment of Minette\u2019s portrait back to Pissarro around May or June 1874: \u201cI will put it [?] in the same crate as the portrait of your little Minette, so as to make only a single shipment. That is the reason for the delay.\u201d This exchange between Pissarro and Piette suggests that returning a portrait was not unusual, especially if it had emotional significance.\n\nFor works shown by Pissarro at the fourth Impressionist exhibition in 1879, see Ruth Berson, ed., The New Painting: Impressionism 1874\u20131886, vol. 2, Exhibited Works (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), pp. 117\u201319. Pissarro exhibited approximately twenty-eight works, including twelve fans, a few gouaches and watercolors, three pastels, and about ten paintings. The paintings were large, ranging from 41.5 \u00d7 50 cm and 60 \u00d7 73 cm to 81 \u00d7 66 cm and 63 \u00d7 83 cm, with one measuring 126 \u00d7 162 cm. Pissarro\u2019s rabbit warren, measuring 59.2 \u00d7 72.3 cm, would have fit right in, especially since he also exhibited several works depicting winter scenes, but was only first exhibited at Pissarro\u2019s solo show in 1892 at Durand-Ruel, Paris.\n\nThe exact sum received by each was 439.50 francs. See PDRS, vol. 1, p. 163.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 1, p. 363, for a list of Pissarro\u2019s works at his retrospective exhibition, which took place January 23\u2013February 20, 1892, at the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris. In the exhibition catalogue The Rabbit Warren was listed as no. 11 of the fifty works shown.\n\nAccording to the painting\u2019s provenance, someone named \u201cPrat\u201d purchased the painting from the art dealer Georges Petit on March 31, 1924, but it is not known whether the name refers to a private party. Camille Pissarro to Octave Mirbeau, Paris, Feb. 12, 1892, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 200\u201301, n. 2. Nine of the works exhibited at her husband\u2019s 1892 retrospective belonged to Julie. The Rabbit Warren was listed as no. 21 in accordance with her husband\u2019s list included with the letter he sent to Durand-Ruel on January 19, 1892. For this letter and the accompanying list see Pissarro to Durand-Ruel, \u00c9ragny par Gisors, Eure, Jan. 19, 1892, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 192\u201393. In a subsequent letter to Durand-Ruel dated March 21, 1892 (published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 [Valhermeil, 1988], p. 210), Pissarro listed some of his works for sale to a prospective American buyer whom he had learned about through a longtime friend, one Madame Moujon. Pissarro listed eleven works from his collection that he was considering selling, complete with their prices and exhibition catalogue numbers. The Rabbit Warren\u2014according to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 363\u2014was listed as no. 11 at Pissarro\u2019s 1892 retrospective. This work was not included in Pissarro\u2019s March 21, 1892, letter to Durand-Ruel, indicating perhaps that Julie did not wish to sell it, as it belonged to her.\n\nSee PDRS cat. 112: Vue sur la c\u00f4te Saint-Denis, Pontoise (c. 1867; private collection).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue with small amounts of lead and/or zinc white and possibly red lake. Cobalt blue, lead white and zinc white identified by XRF. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_336\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 11, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Oct. 13, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The painting was lined prior to acquisition by the Art Institute and its original measurements are not documented. Since this size closely mirrors a standard size and there is no apparent compositional cut-off, it is assumed little was removed from the edges. Additionally, thread angle maps for both the horizontal and vertical threads show strong cusping corresponding to original tack placement, indicating that little, if any, of the original composition was lost. See Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow, (PS587/ 1964.200),\u201d Dec. 2013.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow, (PS587/ 1964.200),\u201d Dec. 2013.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software.

This section of canvas came from the edge of a larger piece of canvas, usually 10 \u00d7 2 meters, that had been commercially prepared. For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46; and Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists, exh. cat. (Skira, 2008), p. 52.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including two aqueous linings and removal of the tacking margins. In part due to the absence of the tacking margins, there were no available samples that included the canvas. Cross-sectional analysis of samples containing the ground layer did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis is the approximate ground thickness in samples examined by SEM/EDX. It should be noted that there were no samples of the that included the canvas. The ground may have different thicknesses in areas that were not sampled. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM andXRF. The presence of lead confirmed with SEM/EDX, PLM and XRF. SEM/EDX and PLM also identified chalk and iron-containing earth pigments, while SEM/EDX detected dolomite, umber, silica and aluminosilicates. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_336\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 11, 2013; Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014; and Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Oct. 13, 2014; all on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe artist-applied interlayer was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. The presence of lead, zinc and calcium confirmed with SEM/EDX and XRF. SEM/EDX also detected barium sulfate, chalk (calcium carbonate), gypsum, aluminosilicates, emerald green and cobalt blue. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_336\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 11, 2013, and Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nCharcoal was identified via PLM. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Oct. 13, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nA principle component image revealing the prior portrait was obtained from a Minimum Noise Fraction transform of a near infrared image cube (966 to 1680 nm, 3.4 nm sampling) obtained from mosaicking image cubes taken with a modified scanning 720 hyperspectral camera (Surface Optics). Images taken by John K. Delaney and Kathryn A. Dooley, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe use of such additives or pre-grinding in oil is discussed in Anthea Callen, The Art of the Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 101. Such bubbles have previously only been connected with Lucien Pissarro\u2019s works. See See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 8.\n\nAlthough visible in the X-ray, three of the four pinholes have been subsequently covered in previous conservation treatments and are no longer visible. The holes still partially visible at the lower right suggest the spacers were used for the visible composition, although their use for the execution of the portrait as well cannot be excluded. Similar pinholes were also found on Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), Woman and Child at the Well (1882; cat. 11), The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13), and Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (1894/95; cat. 14). See also the discussion of taquets bois in Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists, exh. cat. (Skira, 2008), pp. 92\u201393.\n\nPigments were identified by the following techniques: lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, emerald green, viridian, chrome yellow, iron-oxide red and yellow, and vermilion (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); ultramarine blue, red lead, possible zinc yellow (PLM, SEM/EDX); bone black (PLM, XRF); cochineal lake (SERS, PLM [as red lake]); umber (SEM/EDX). For details and specific conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_336\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Oct. 11, 2013; Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014; Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbetWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_SERS\\_Results,\u201d Oct 10, 2013; and Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, Oct. 13, 2014; all on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present.\n\nThe intimate mixture of lead and zinc whites detected with SEM/EDX suggests that both compositions contain the lead white and zinc white mixture found in other Pissarro works throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture was found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. This mixture was also identified in Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3), The Crystal Palace (1871; cat. 4), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 9), Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12), The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13).

SEM/EDX identified aluminum, sulfur, calcium and tin as components of the red lake\u2019s substrate. Cross-sectional examination also revealed the presence of starch; in other works of the period, starch has been associated with poor driers such as red lake, bone black and viridian and was likely added as extender to improve drying properties. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbitWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Sept. 24, 2014; and Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_RabbetWarren\\_1964\\_200\\_SERS\\_Results,\u201d Oct 10, 2013; both on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.

In other cases, he wrote on the verso of paintings indicating they should not be varnished, as with Landscape at Chaponval (1880; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), however it is unclear when this practice started. For further discussion of Pissarro\u2019s varnishing practices see Michael Swicklick, \u201cFrench Painting and the Use of Varnish, 1750\u20131900,\u201d Conservation Research: Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 41, vol. 2 (Washington, D.C., 1993) pp. 168\u201369). Esther Pissarro\u2019s typed note is reproduced in Anthea Callen, \u201cThe Unvarnished Truth: Mattness, \u2018Primitivism,\u2019 and Modernity in French Painting, c. 1870\u20131907,\u201d Burlington Magazine 135, 1100 (Nov. 1994), pp. 739\u201340.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, treatment report, Nov. 3, 1975, on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago. The date of the aqueous lining is unknown, however the presence of the inscription Saltz on the verso of either the original or interleaf-lining canvas (visible in an infrared image of the verso) may date the lining to around the time the work passed through the gallery of Sam Salz, circa 1958. See Provenance in the curatorial entry and PDRS, vol. 2, p. 399, cat. 587.\n\nTim Lennon, examination report, Mar. 21, 1994, on file in the Conservation Department, the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe alterations to the frame, including diminishing the sight size and adding the ornament, suggest that the frame is not original to the work. There is, however, no known documentation of the earlier frames.\n\nBoth the quality of the carving and recutting of the gesso are very fine, although unfortunately the hollow and sight molding have been compromised.\n\nThe wood used in the back frame is American chestnut and was added at the same time as the sight molding addition to adapt the frame for this painting. This would place the date of this pairing\u2014close to, or at the time of, its acquisition from Knoedler, New York, by Marshall Field in 1963.\n\nAccording to Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition Camille Pissarro, exh. cat.

The inscription may have functioned as a way to label either the painting or the interleaf-lining canvas during the lining process. Its presence within the lining may date the lining to roughly that time.
