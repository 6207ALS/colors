    "description": "<p>In her writing, videos, and photographs, Moyra Davey ruminates in apparently unassuming ways on the things that populate her immediate environment. In <em>Copperhead Grid</em>, made early in her career, Davey zeroed in on a dollar's worth of common pennies\u2014insignificant objects of exchange\u2014to concentrate on their intimate handling and the resultant scarring or obliteration of the portraits on their faces. Although the pennies are enlarged to more than their usual size in her photographs, the artist's treatment of Abraham Lincoln in repeated small rectangles is precisely the opposite of the monumentalizing found in memorials like Mount Rushmore. According to some economists, the penny, an almost worthless coin often involuntarily withdrawn from circulation, is soon likely to go the way of the analog camera. Yet these worn, insignificant items still remain in the system, and can still retain the bite referred to in the work's punning title.</p>\n",
