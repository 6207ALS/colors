The image appeared in a section of the journal entitled \u201cCostumes et Portraits,\u201d following reproductions of two Cranach woodcuts. The same issue also included an article on monsters, another on Saint Nicholas, and a \u201cChanson pour la Toussaint\u201d (\u201cSong for All Saints\u2019 Day\u201d); Whistler\u2019s lithograph was described in the table of contents as \u201cpetit nu tenant un bol.\u201d\n\nImpressions were pulled from supplementary stones for three distinct editions of the journal by Lemercier in Paris, and the Ways subsequently pulled a set of impressions from the original stone in London. T. R. Way (1896, 1905) dated Girl with Bowl to 1895, and there is no compelling reason to question this dating. It seems likely that the artist drew the lithograph in Paris during the spring or summer of 1895, in response to a request from the editors of L\u2019Ymagier for an image they could publish in the fall issue. With the exception of this image, Whistler seems not to have been engaged in lithography in this period. However, he enthusiastically returned to making transfer drawings in September when he and Beatrix began their sojourn in Lyme Regis.\n\nWhistler had the original stone sent to the Ways in London following the printing of the published edition (letter 150). They received it on October 29 and probably pulled their impressions soon after (letter 152; app. II.4). Their use of black ink, western laid papers, and Japanese papers different from those favored by Lemercier distinguishes their proofs from those printed in Paris (see paragraph 8). Whistler signed many of them in graphite, probably in anticipation of sales from the Fine Art Society exhibition of 1895\u201396.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Whistler defended Girl with Bowl in letters to New York dealer Edward Kennedy, who had taken exception to the quality of the image when an impression reached him in February 1896. In March the artist responded to Kennedy\u2019s criticism with the following remark: \u201cAnd as to the \u2018Girl with the Bowl,\u2019 I may content myself with telling you that it is one of the prettiest drawings of the lot\u2014a great success in Paris where it first appeared. In London the draped and nude figures were the most sought after in the whole exhibition.\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 227 mm), signed; SC, cream Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 221 mm). Glasgow: HAG (4), cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 226 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 221 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (288 \u00d7 221 mm); cream laid paper (270 \u00d7 225 mm).

No printed legend was added. Three distinct editions of the periodical were printed, and a livret at the back of the October 1895 issue provides the following information regarding the papers used for Whistler\u2019s lithograph: the ordinary edition (\u00e9dition A) contained impressions printed on chine; the deluxe edition offered impressions on japon imperial mince; and for \u00e9dition Z, twelve numbered impressions were printed on vieux japon \u00e0 la cuve. The majority of the impressions examined for this catalogue were printed in light or dark gray ink on cream Japanese vellum; these are undoubtedly impressions from the deluxe edition. An impression in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, on a China paper frequently used by Lemercier (see cat. 45) must be from the ordinary edition. The impression in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, printed on a silky, opaque, high-quality Japanese vellum, is probably one of those printed on the japon \u00e0 la cuve described in the livret, although it is not numbered, and indeed no numbered impressions have been located to date.\n\nThere is considerable variation in the sheet sizes of impressions printed for L\u2019Ymagier. Some have obviously been trimmed, but there are also a number of sheets with dimensions larger than those of the periodical itself. These are proof impressions, printed outside the periodical edition in gray ink on each of the three papers described above. In addition, five striking experimental proofs printed in gray ink on richly colored Japanese vellums have been located.\n\nChicago: AIC (4), purple wove Japanese vellum (303 \u00d7 222 mm); orange wove Japanese vellum (303 \u00d7 222 mm); blue wove Japanese vellum (303 \u00d7 222 mm); red wove Japanese vellum (304 \u00d7 222 mm); Palmer, cream wove Japanese paper (270 \u00d7 192 mm). Glasgow: HAG (2), grayish ivory China paper (269 \u00d7 231 mm); cream Japanese paper (298 \u00d7 219 mm). London: BL, cream Japanese paper (268 \u00d7 210 mm) bound.\n\nRemarks: Periodical impressions are found in many museum and library collections, including Cambridge, Mass., FAM; New York, NYPL; and Paris, BN. There is an impression on dark pink wove Japanese vellum in New York, private collection.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.

It is conceivable that Whistler might have been approached by the editors for a contribution to the opening number. In October 1894 the artist was engaged in creating a number of variations on the theme of the draped model in lithography (see letter 126), watercolor, pastel, and oil. However, if the image was in fact drawn in the autumn of 1894 it is puzzling that it did not appear in the periodical until a full year later.\n\nWhistler to Edward Kennedy, March 1896, NYPL II/75.\n\nWhistler\u2019s lithograph never appeared in the periodical on one of these dyed papers. However, a very similar paper in orange, described in the index as japon fr. rouge, was used for the publication of Henri Rousseau\u2019s pen lithograph La Guerre, in L\u2019Ymagier 2, no. 2 (January 1895).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 118, only state.
