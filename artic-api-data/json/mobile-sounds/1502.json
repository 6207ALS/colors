    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: If you could have looked into the bedroom of an American lady 250 years ago, you might have seen this lovely little table. The town of Salem, where it was made, was one of the most affluent places in the colonies. Its furniture was noted for its simple elegance and beautiful proportions. The overall style of this table is called &quot;Rococo&quot; with its graceful curves, and motifs of shells and other natural forms. The legs are each made from a single piece of mahogany, the form of the leg, with its elegant S-shaped curve, is known as &quot;cabriole.&quot; The leg flares out at the very top, this is called the &quot;knee,&quot; and it narrows and curves in at the ankle, near the bottom, and then out again at the foot. If you dropped a straight line from any corner of the table down to the floor, you'd find that the feet line up exactly below the corners. But the flowing curve gives the illusion of a much wider stance.</p>\n",
