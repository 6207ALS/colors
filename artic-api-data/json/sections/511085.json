To ensure tighter control, by the end of his reign all gold and silver was minted only in the capital. This coin cannot be dated precisely due to the lack of any consular years or other datable titles in the legends, though the outward direction of the obverse legend, paired with the appearance of this particular reverse, narrows it down to the period A.D. 74\u201379. The reverse of the coin depicts Fortuna Augusta, the aspect of Fortune that watched over the emperor; her rudder steered the state while her cornucopia promised plenty. Here Fortune\u2019s power may refer to the precipitous rise of the \u201cSabine countryman\u201d to the position of emperor of the Roman State. Vespasian\u2019s family was of equestrian, or middle-class, origin, and according to his biographer Suetonius, the emperor was quite comfortable with his lack of aristocratic background. He was also notoriously tight with money\u2014an excusable vice, considering that Nero had left Rome bankrupt, and Vespasian needed all the help he could get from Fortune to get Rome back up on its feet. Vespasian\u2019s portrait signals a trend back toward the artistic realism of the Late Republic: the classicizing idealism seen in the Julio-Claudian family portraits is replaced here by a harsher yet skillful and sympathetic rendering of the aging and shrewd warrior.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Imperator Caesar Vespasianus Augustus\n\nCarradice, \u201cFlavian Coinage,\u201d p. 376.\n\nBMCRE II, pp. xxvii\u2013xxviii.\n\nRIC II, pp. xxxvii\u2013xxxviii.\n\nSuetonius, Vespasian, sec. 12.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 44 Aureus (Coin) Portraying Emperor Vespasian, A.D. 75/79\n\n</section>",
