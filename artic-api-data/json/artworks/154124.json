The flag is turned on its side so that the stripes are vertical, and the stars are on the right. The man grasps one of the stripes of the flag in his fist. In this way, the man seems to be imprisoned by the American flag, and is trying to break free."

    "description": "<p>Benny Andrews attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago from 1954 to 1958 on the G.I. Bill. Upon graduating, he moved to New York, where he began agitating for black artists to be represented at major museums in the city. A cofounder of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) in 1969, Andrews was increasingly categorized as a \u201cprotest artist.\u201d<p></p>\n<p><em>Flag Day</em> can be read as a harbinger of two later projects\u2014a program Andrews organized through the BECC to teach art to inmates in New York City prisons, and a large body of work from the early 1970s he made to mark America\u2019s bicentennial. This intimately scaled, potent painting shows a black man imprisoned by the \u201cbars\u201d of the American flag.<p>\n",
