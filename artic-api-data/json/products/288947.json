    "description": "<p>Reaching blooms from a radiant spring bouquet by Vincent van Gogh (Dutch, 1853\u20131890) decorate our enamel pendant. In May of 1890, just before his departure from the asylum in Saint-R\u00e9my, the artist painted four exceptional still lifes, including the exuberant Irises (1890). Van Gogh sought to achieve a \"harmonious and soft\" effect by placing the \"violet\" flowers against a \"pink background.\" Owing to his use of fugitive red pigments, these colors have since faded with time.</p>\n<p>Details</p>\n<p>\u2022 18K gold plate</p>\n<p>\u2022 Enamel</p>\n<p>\u2022 Lobster-claw closure</p>\n<p>\u2022 Chain: 16''L with 2'' extender</p>\n<p>\u2022 Pendant: 1 1/4'' diam.</p>\n<p>\u2022 Clean with a damp cloth and dry with a soft, clean cloth</p>",
