The artist did not speak English, and so his classes were essentially visual performances: he rapidly modeled a sculpture in clay over the course of a lesson and directed students to follow his lead. The French-born British sculptor \u00c9douard Lant\u00e9ri later recalled that Dalou \u201ccompletely carried his students away with him. He knew how to inspire them with the desire to work as well as the love of work, and succeeded in awakening an extraordinary enthusiasm where all before seemed dormant.\u201d</p>\n",
