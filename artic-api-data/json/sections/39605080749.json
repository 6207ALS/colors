Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as in this second\u2014and final\u2014state impression. After satisfactorily arriving at a final composition on the block, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color on paper using oil-based media, some that contained beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 59.2.2).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 59.2.3).\n\nThree different layers of media are present in this print. Gauguin eschewed the chrome yellow tone that he applied first in the majority of impressions from the Noa Noa Suite, proceeding instead to the application of the penultimate layer of transferred oil media. In this striated layer of oil media, various tones of chrome yellow predominate. Vermilion, madder lake, emerald green, and ultramarine blue are also present, and zinc white appears as an extender throughout (see fig. 59.2.4 and fig. 59.2.5). Atop this spectrum of colored media, the block was printed twice; first in pale-orange printing ink (a mixture of chrome yellow or chrome orange and vermilion [est.]). Once the colors were in place, the block was printed a second time in black ink (a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue). This is a rare example of an impression that has retained much of its vibrancy and therefore can be used as a means to assess the degree of fading in others.\n\nExamination of the Japanese paper support reveals that instead of using one thick sheet of paper, Gauguin adhered two sheets of Japanese paper together to make a laminate that is quite rigid and sturdy. Both are wove papers, although the bottom sheet is a good bit thicker than the top sheet. Although the artist used laminated sheets of fibrous Japanese paper onto which he brushed colorful, translucent washes of watercolor, this is the sole example identified during the course of this study where a similar, albeit thicker, laminate was used in concert with the application of oil-based media. The combined thickness of the Japanese papers provided strength at the expense of the lustrous translucent quality found among other, similarly laminated sheets.\n\nFor the verso of this sheet, see fig. 59.2.1.\n\n203 \u00d7 353 mm (image/primary/secondary support)\n\nIn order to fully assess the three different layers of media, surface shape studies were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the topography of the various media as they sit on the surface of the paper (see fig. 59.2.3). The first layer of colored media was applied to create tonal and textural variations beneath the black printing ink layer; this was achieved by means of transfer from another source. Its even appearance and uniform dispersion onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. This support could have been another piece of paper or another wood block; however, it is more likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. In this impression the striations of media blended into one another as they were horizontally brushed across the sheet of glass (fig. 59.2.6). In the lower right a frisket was used to isolate the diagonal passage below and to the right of the standing figure. In this area, the media were diagonally brushed onto the glass (fig. 59.2.7). Site specificity of media application was limited to this and a stroke of blue in the wave at center. While in other impressions the oil-based media were evenly applied onto the solid support, here they were brush applied with coarse-bristled brushes that imparted dimensional striations into them. The resultant brushstrokes were then transferred onto the paper, flattened and broadened in the transfer process, rather than forming the discrete irregular islands of media visible in so many other impressions (fig. 59.2.8).\n\nIn this impression Gauguin altered his oil-based medium to obtain a semifluid consistency for the areas described above, while in others he used the medium in a dry manner. The way the medium sits on the surface of the paper is a direct result of the degree of solvent dilution that altered the working properties of the media. In the central foreground the media is quite dry and sits atop the paper fibers (fig. 59.2.9), while to the left of the seated figure the spectrum of colors has a more fluid consistency (fig. 59.2.10). Deviating from his usual working method whereby zones of color filled and helped to define specific forms, in this impression, one color merges into another to create a contiguous gradation of colors across the sheet unencumbered by the outlines of individual forms (fig. 59.2.11).\n\nWith the striated tonal layer of media in place on the paper, the block was printed twice, first in pale-orange ink, followed by deliberately misaligned and uneven printing in black ink. Although the black printing obscures much of the pale-orange printing beneath it, in areas where there is misalignment, the pale orange is discernible, most notably along the left edge of the sheet where the artist shifted the black printing a quarter inch to the right (see fig. 59.2.7). The bottom half of the composition is a dark, even, velvety black tone that resulted from more than one pass of the inked roller over the block. From the top half of the block, the black ink was selectively removed to obtain an uneven, reticulated surface in which the paper\u2019s tone and surface texture are visible.\n\nAmong the forty-one impressions in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this print is among the most pristine in the group. The colors retain their vibrancy, and the paper tone lacks the golden hue of discoloration that others display. For this reason, the print was used as a benchmark against which other impressions were chromatically assessed. Comparison with similar passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite such as this, and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with ivory to cream hues rather than golden tones.\n\nThe sheet has a slight undulation overall and there is a small tear along the right edge that extends 5 mm into the composition.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon.

Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.

The collection was purchased in Basel after Durrio failed to return the cash deposit on the works loaned for the 1928 exhibition. Walther Geiser\u2019s collector\u2019s stamp (not in Lugt) is on the verso.\n\nGeiser, who purchased the collection, consigned it to Lucas Lichtenhan for sale on January 18, 1931, as written out in a signed contract; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nGeiser, as owner of the collection, consigned it to Lucas Lichtenhan for sale on January 18, 1931, but the print did not sell so it was returned to Geiser after they terminated their contract in 1936; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe works in the Paco Durrio, and later Walter Geiser, wood-block prints in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago have inscriptions on the verso that were deciphered as the order they were exhibited and presented in the catalogue for the 1906 Salon d\u2019automne at the Grand Palais des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. This print is inscribed with the number 2, the second print in the \u201cGravures sur bois\u201d section of the exhibition, which corresponds to entry no. 137, \u201cAnti [sic] te pape.\u201d\n\nThere are two editions of this exhibition catalogue.
