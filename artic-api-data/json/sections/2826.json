It belongs to a group of works that Henri Matisse undertook while summering with his family in Cavali\u00e8re-sur-Mer, a small village on the south coast of France. They were created in preparation for the decorative panels Dance (II) (summer\u2013fall 1910; fig. 16.1) and Music (winter\u2013fall 1910; fig. 16.2) that he made for Sergei Shchukin\u2014and relate to corresponding changes to Bathers by a River (1909/10, May\u2013Nov. 1913, and early spring 1916\u2013c. Oct. 17; cat. 25). By traveling to the Midi, the site of Arcadian inspiration for French artists for centuries\u2014and more specifically, to the site just east of Saint-Tropez that was the source for his Luxe, calme, et volupt\u00e9 (1904\u201305; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris)\u2014the artist made clear his intention to set the large-scale works in a pastoral paradise. Matisse brought along his trusted model Loulou Brouty, who sat for Nude with a White Scarf (Mar.\u2013May 1909; fig. 16.3), earlier in Paris. She was accustomed to the artist\u2019s rigorous schedule and was willing to pose nude outdoors\u2014a prospect made all the more daunting by the cold weather that season\u2014requirements that might have prevented Matisse from finding a local model quickly.\n\nIn general, the works he made in Cavali\u00e8re in the summer of 1909 depict a nude female figure in a forest or on a shore. Examples include such canvases as Nude by the Sea (July\u2013Aug. 1909; fig. 16.4), Rose Nude (summer 1909; Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble), Nude by the Sea, Cavali\u00e8re (summer 1909; location unknown), Nude in Sunlit Landscape (summer 1909; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York), and Bather (July\u2013Aug. 1909; Museum of Modern Art, New York). With the exception of Bather, the works share similar palettes, dimensions, and formats as well as abbreviated forms that suggest the artist\u2019s interest in the dissolving effect of the brilliant Mediterranean sun on details and its unifying influence on color and volume, both of which he hoped replicate in his monumental canvases for Shchukin. Indeed, years later he would describe such works to art historian Alfred H. Barr as \u201ca warming up\u201d for the panels.\n\nBather, however, with its searching contour lines and compact form, relates to a group of pen-and-ink figure studies that he made over the summer, among them Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with a Sketch of a Foot. Matisse produced such works (see fig. 16.5 and fig. 16.6) with a reed pen; according to his son Pierre, he was particularly fond of those sourced from the Midi. The reed\u2019s unforgiving fibrous quality demanded a blunt tip and a quick stroke. The repeated draining of the ink load from Matisse\u2019s pen caused the varying width and somewhat coarse nature of the figure\u2019s contour. Using the reed produced an emphatic line and a solid, stable sense of form\u2014both of which the artist favored as he prepared to make Dance (II) and Music.\n\nFor the decorative panels, Matisse would return to Issy-les-Moulineaux and transform his compositions, giving them a new sense of volume and weight. Seated Female Nude reflects this direction: certain structural lines, which can be seen in the shin, abdomen, and shoulder, emphasize the firmness of the pose as well as placement on the page. This is also reflected in the single foot in the top left corner of the sheet, with its repeated contours running along the inside of the arch, suggesting mass despite its foreshortened position. Matisse\u2019s concern is even echoed in the sculpture Study of a Foot (c. 1909, cast 1952; fig. 16.7), perhaps made upon his return from Cavali\u00e8re. It relates to this drawing as well as to the solid but springing feet of the figures in Dance (II). While the foot in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing may share characteristics with the figures of the Shchukin panel, the resting body of Brouty relates to Bathers by a River and Matisse\u2019s recent rotation of the figure to the left of the water, moving it from a side to a frontal position.\n\nSoon after the completion of this work, Matisse wrote to Shchukin about his trip, reporting, \u201cAfter two, almost three months by the sea I am returning to Paris satisfied with the health of my family and the work I have done here. I have finished with the model and bring documents that will be very useful for your decorations.\u201d While the artist did, practically speaking, paint subjects related to the compositions, his process of working and the sturdiness of his figures as seen in Seated Female Nude would register a significant change in his forthcoming work back in his Issy studio.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew the woman directly with a reed pen and black ink on white wove paper. There is no preliminary sketch.\n\nThe artist is known to have drawn with reeds he collected himself in the South of France. He cut his pens from the dry, hollow reed shafts. The square ends to the pen strokes are characteristic of a blunt-cut reed nib (see fig. 16.8). Due to the width and fibrous nature of the reed wall, reeds are best suited for cutting wider points and blunt, square-cut nibs. The short pen strokes that make up the composition are also characteristic of reed pens because the nib has no channel or reservoir to hold ink, which is necessary to execute longer lines. Matisse pushed the boundaries of his instrument and attempted long lines, at times until the pen ran out of ink. For example, the outline of the face is one continuous stroke (see fig. 16.9). Starting with a full pen at the upper left, Matisse laid down a rich, black line that narrows, then becomes abruptly fainter and broken as the pen ran out of ink on the right side of the face. Such broken lines can be seen throughout and are the result of the dry nib catching the paper grain.\n\nMicroscope examination at 80\u00d7 of the ink along the top and lower edges of the primary support indicates they were trimmed after Matisse completed the drawing. The sheet was likely trimmed in preparation for mounting. It cannot be determined whether the right and left edges were also trimmed.\n\nThe drawing is on an original mount comprising two successively larger sheets of paper with an impressed plate mark that together create a series of expanding borders (see fig. 16.10); it belongs to a group of works mounted in a similar fashion by the photographer and gallerist Eug\u00e8ne Druet. The drawing was dry mounted to a darker, cream-colored paper, producing a 1 cm border around it. The tertiary support is a lighter, ivory color and makes another contrasting 3 cm border. A plate mark in the tertiary support, measuring 35 \u00d7 28 cm, serves as yet another framing element. Dry mount tissue is evident along the lower left edge under magnification 80\u00d7.\n\nSigned and dated: Henri-Matisse ao\u00fbt 1909 (lower left, in brown and black ink) (fig. 16.11).\n\nReed pen and black ink.\n\nThe primary support is medium-thick, moderately textured, white wove paper. There is a partial watermark along the lower right edge that reads: [TURK]EY MILL 1908 ENGLAND (2 \u00d7 22.3 cm [max.]) (see fig. 16.12 and fig. 16.13). Microscope examination of ink at the top and lower edges indicates those edges were trimmed after Matisse completed the drawing. It cannot be determined if the right and left edges were also trimmed. The edges are straight cut.\n\nThe secondary support is thin, smooth, cream wove paper.\n\nThe tertiary support is thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper. The irregular left and lower margins of the tertiary support suggest those edges have been trimmed. The texture on the recto has been slightly compressed within the plate mark. On the verso (fig. 16.14), a fine screen pattern imparted by the paper mold is visible in raking light.\n\nPrimary support: 29.8 \u00d7 23.6 cm (11 3/4 \u00d7 9 1/4 in.); secondary support: 31.7 \u00d7 25.5 cm (12 1/2 \u00d7 10 in.); tertiary support: 38.4 \u00d7 31.2 cm (15 \u00d7 12 1/4 in.).\n\nExamination indicates that the work has not undergone conservation treatment.\n\nThere is stray black media in the lower left margin of the tertiary support, possibly ink used for the signature. The tip of the lower left corner of the tertiary support is crushed. There are minor handling dents in the margins of the tertiary support, and there is a burnished mark at its right edge. The irregular left and lower margins of the tertiary support suggest those edges have been trimmed.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Emily Crane Chadbourne (Mar. 4, 1871\u2013Dec. 23, 1964), Stone Ridge, NY, by Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Dec. 21, 1926.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Dec. 21, 1926.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, as Drawing (no 176).\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 1033, as Woman Nursing Knee\u2014A Foot, 1909.\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, Henri Matisse, Nov. 13, 1951\u2013Jan. 13, 1952; Cleveland Museum of Art, Feb. 5\u2013Mar. 16, 1952; Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 1\u2013May 4, 1952, addendum to catalogue, no cat. no., as Women [sic] Nursing Knee, (1909); San Francisco Museum of Art, May 22\u2013July 6, 1952 (Chicago only).\n\nLos Angeles, UCLA Art Galleries, Henri Matisse Retrospective 1966, Jan. 5\u2013Feb. 27, 1966, cat. 153 (ill.), as Seated Woman Clasping Her Right Knee; Woman Nursing Knee; a Foot/Nu assis, 1909; Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 11\u2013Apr. 24, 1966; Boston, Museum of Fine Arts, May 11\u2013June 26, 1966.\n\nBaltimore Museum of Art, Matisse as a Draughtsman, Jan. 12\u2013Feb. 21, 1971, cat. 17 (ill.), as Seated Model Clasping Knee, 1909; San Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, Mar. 20\u2013May 9, 1971; Art Institute of Chicago, May 26\u2013July 10, 1971 (fig. 16.15).\n\nNew York, Museum of Modern Art, The Sculpture of Matisse, Feb. 24\u2013May 8, 1972, cat. 81 (ill.), as Seated Model Clasping Knee, (1909); Minneapolis, Walker Art Center, June 20\u2013Aug. 6, 1972; Berkeley, University Art Museum, University of California, Sept. 18\u2013Oct. 29, 1972.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Imaging the Body: From Fragment to Total Display, Jan. 28\u2013Apr. 28, 1992, no cat.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, Mar. 20\u2013June 20, 2010, cat. 10f, as Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with Sketch of Foot, August 1909; New York, Museum of Modern Art, July 18\u2013Oct. 11, 2010.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Daniel Catton Rich, ed., Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture; Lent from American Collections, exh. cat.

Watrous does not specify when the two artists began this practice. Pierre Matisse reported that they may have been influenced by the letters of Vincent van Gogh, in which he praised the reeds of southern France for drawing; see Watrous, Craft of Old-Master Drawings, p. 56n18. Yet very few of Van Gogh\u2019s letters were published prior to 1914, so their influence on the choice of reed pens for this drawing is unclear. Jo van Gogh-Bonger, ed., Vincent van Gogh: Brieven aan zijn broeder (Mij. voor Goede en Goedkoope Lectuur, 1914).\n\nFor a full discussion of the qualities of reed-pen lines, see Watrous, Craft of Old Master Drawings, pp. 57\u201359.\n\nThis is one of nine Matisse drawings in the Art Institute\u2019s collection on similar mounts: Standing Female Nude Seen from the Back (1900/01; cat. 1), Nude in Profile (1903\u201304; cat. 4), Boats (1905; cat. 5), Grounded Fishing Boat (1905; cat. 6), Standing Female Nude with Chair (1907; cat. 12), Seated Female Nude, One Foot on a Stool (1910; cat. 13), Standing Female Nude, Twisting toward Her Back (c. 1908; cat. 15), Seated Female Nude, Holding One Knee, with Sketch of a Foot (Aug. 1909; cat. 16), and Girl with a Cat (1910; cat. 17). See \u201cMounting Evidence.\u201d\n\nMatisse began signing \u201cHenri\u201d in brown ink, then rewrote it and finished his signature with black ink.\n\nDescriptions of paper thickness and texture follow the standard set forth in Elizabeth Lunning and Roy Perkinson, The Print Council of America Paper Sample Book: A Practical Guide to the Description of Paper (Print Council of America/Sun Hill, 1996).\n\nChadbourne was a lender to the Grafton Galleries 1910 exhibition and this work was included; although she may have acquired it earlier, there is no known proof of a purchase date; thus, its ownership can only be documented by the time of the exhibition the following year [London, 1910].
