    "description": "<p>In this interactive gallery program, Chicago poets Kathleen Rooney and Eric Plattner read and write poems in response to Go. Visitors join in the program by requesting a poem written about artworks on view in the exhibition.</p><p><strong> About the artists</strong></p><p>Since the summer of 2011, when they made their debut at Wicker Park Fest, the poets of Poems While You Wait have been subverting the clich\u00e9 of the solitary writer toiling in obscurity by bringing themselves\u2014and their typewriters\u2014to public places throughout the city of Chicago and composing commissioned poetry on demand for strangers. The process is simple: the customer signs up for a poem by requesting a subject of their choosing, and then waiting 10\u201315 minutes while one of the poets creates a custom-made, original poem to keep or to give away as a gift.</p>",
