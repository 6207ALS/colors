Yoakum reported having a dream that inspired him to draw, and over the next 10 years the retired veteran produced some 2,000 works. This exhibition follows a shifting progression of Yoakum\u2019s mountainous terrain, arid deserts, and majestic waterways, as well as a selection of his portraits of African American icons, testifying to the rich imagination of an exceptional American artist as well as to the remarkable circumstances that led to his lasting legacy.</p><p>Open exclusively to Luminary members, this tour requires advance registration and is limited to twelve participants.
