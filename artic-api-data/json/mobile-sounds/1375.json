    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This is a recent acquisition, it's very difficult today to find high quality paintings by known masters of the Renaissance still in private hands, finding one of this beauty, importance and condition is very rare indeed.  It is a nativity scene painted by the 16th Century master Fra Bartolomeo, a Florentine friar and follower of the religious and political reformer Savonarola.  His devotion as a Christian brother is evident in the sincerity with which he painted this picture, the delicate, almost ethereal profiles of Joseph and the Virgin Mary.  The painting is intimate in scale and feeling, it has a softness, sweetness and purity of response to this holy occasion, the birth of Jesus, it shows the Virgin Mary and Joseph on either side of the baby Jesus in a rustic setting with three diaphanous angels floating above to emphasize the holy nature of the activity below.  Two other angels approach behind the Virgin Mary and in the distance we see a landscape.  The landscape is one we know from drawings by Fra Bartolomeo.  In fact, Fra Bartolomeo made numerous drawings for this painting, drawings of the principal figures, the angels, the landscape, everything.  It was a painting on which the artist labored for a long time even though the beauty and elegance of the result seemed so natural and simple.</p>\n",
