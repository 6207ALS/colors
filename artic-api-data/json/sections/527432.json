In 1880 she married Lewis Larned Coburn, a prominent patent attorney and one of the founders (and first president) of the Union League Club of Chicago. Upon his death in 1910, Mrs. Coburn began to collect art, initially purchasing American works and gradually expanding her collection to include French Impressionist paintings. Around the same time, she moved into an apartment in the Blackstone Hotel. Although wall space was limited in her new home, she continued to collect works of art, which she displayed in her own unique and intimate way (fig. 2, fig. 3, fig. 4, fig. 5, and fig. 6).\n\nFrom April 6 to October 9, 1932, the Art Institute of Chicago (under the auspices of its Antiquarian Society) held a special exhibition of more than sixty paintings, watercolors, drawings, and pastels from Mrs. Coburn\u2019s collection. Just two months after the opening of the exhibition\u2014which included \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Woman Reading (fig. 7), one of her last major acquisitions\u2014Mrs. Coburn died, leaving the Art Institute more than one hundred works of art. The Fogg Museum at Harvard University and Smith College also received portions of her collection.\n\nThe Beach at Sainte-Adresse (cat. 13)\n\nCliff Walk at Pourville (cat. 19)\n\nStacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn) (cat. 28)\n\nWater Lily Pond (cat. 37)\n\nV\u00e9theuil (cat. 42)\n\nVenice, Palazzo Dario (cat. 45)\n\nChamp de coquelicots (Poppy Field)\n\nCitrons sur une branche (Lemons on a Branch)\n\n\u00c9glise de Varengeville, temps gris (The Church at Varengeville, Gray Weather)\n\nPortrait de L\u00e9on Peltier\n\nAlfred Sisley (cat. 4)\n\nYoung Woman Sewing (cat. 7)\n\nTwo Sisters (On the Terrace) (cat. 11)\n\nLa cueillette des fleurs\n\nL\u2019alg\u00e9rienne\n\nPivoines\n\nLa cour de l\u2019\u00e9picerie, Berneval-le-Petit (The Grocer\u2019s Yard, Berneval-le-Petit)\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn\n\nfig. 1 Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (1856\u20131932) seated in her Blackstone Hotel apartment in Chicago.
