    "description": "<p><em>Breaking Storm, Coast of Maine</em> is a study of bands of juxtaposed color constructed along a strong horizon line, emphasized by a thick, dark line. Despite Homer\u2019s indication of impending bad weather moving in from the horizon, this watercolor focuses on a moment of calm before the storm. The water\u2019s turquoise surface is smooth and tranquil, achieved by pure, transparent washes. The artist\u2019s loose, abstract handling of the rugged shore in the foreground calls attention to the sheer beauty of his brushstrokes.</p>\n<p>Homer conjured the effect of land, sea, and sky seen through a veil of rain and humidity by painting wet-on-wet. In this manner, the artist introduced a new wash into one that is still wet, allowing colors to run and blend without solid boundaries. Evidence indicates that Homer learned the practice from studying Japanese ink paintings and began to employ it extensively beginning in 1889.</p>\n",
