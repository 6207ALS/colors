    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The South American artist known as Matta settled in France in 1933 where he became involved with the surrealists. This painting is a tribute to his friend, the Spanish poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who was killed by Fascist forces during the Spanish War. Curator of modern art, Stephanie D'Alessandro.</p>\n<p>STEPHANIE D'ALESSANDRO: This painting is just a marvel. It\u2019s so intricate and mysterious and beautiful and ethereal all at the same time. Matta was very interested in trying to harness the subconscious and he came up with this idea of what he called psychological morphologies. They were basically paintings that he made using the special kind of technique of dripping paint and thin washes over the canvas and drawing out sort of unconscious, unplanned forms. So, we can see the early part of Matta\u2019s process, these beautiful thin veils and washes of paint. For example, on the bottom part of the canvas where it almost seems like we see yellow earth or some kind of horizon line that meets this beautiful blue celestial kind of sky. You can see on top of that area these thin lines of darker paint that almost look like ink wash where he\u2019s gone in and started to describe imaginary figures or forms to now take this image to another level, another level of description.</p>\n",
