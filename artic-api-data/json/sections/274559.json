I.1, III.2, V.1  \nLifetime Exhibitions: London 1895 (no. 91, as Figure Study); London 1895\u201396 (no. 12, as Draped Figure with Book); Chicago 1900b (no. 32); New York 1901 (no. 138)\n\nThe drawing for this lithograph was so lightly sketched that after the transfer to stone, the features of the young model\u2019s face were barely discernible. Whistler seems to have dismissed the image initially, but in December 1893 he wrote to T. R. Way about \u201ca little draped figure of a girl standing reading a letter,\u201d and included two small sketches of the subject (letter 69). He inquired if the drawing was one of those he had ordered destroyed, explaining that he had just found a proof \u201cthat I now think well of!\u201d This letter suggests that he was associating The Novel: Girl Reading with the group of three draped figures that he had indeed ordered the Ways to erase from the stone (cat. 29, cat. 30, and cat. 31). Whistler changed his mind about all four lithographs and was glad the stones had been preserved by his printers.\n\nIt is surprising that T. R. Way cited only six impressions of this print in his catalogue of 1905, since the Whistler-Way correspondence shows that Whistler had ordered and received ten impressions in 1892 and 1893. To date, more than twice Way\u2019s number of lifetime impressions have been identified.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (311 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; MWC, tan laid paper (310 \u00d7 203 mm), signed.
