    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Toulouse Lautrec made his name with his depictions of the night clubs and performers of Montmartre in northern Paris. Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: So, he\u2019s really documenting not only the night club, but this phenomena that happens at the end of the 19th century in France, which is celebrity culture. Probably the most well-known of these performers is Jane Avril. She\u2019s the woman you see with her back turned to us, this incredibly orange-red hair.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Jane Avril is seated with friends at the table that was permanently reserved for Toulouse Lautrec at the Moulin Rouge. Curiously, the artist depicts himself walking by behind the table. He\u2019s the very short man walking with a much taller figure.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And then the other performer that was well-known at the time is this very garish-looking woman who just looms out into our space at the right-hand side of the canvas and she is an English performer named May Milton with this kind of insect-like hat that he would always portray her in.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The heavy greenish shadows on her face exaggerate the effects of the recently installed electric lighting. They give her face and eerie mask-like character, which is both compelling and chilling.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: He really is capturing not just who was who and who was where, but it\u2019s the sense of decadence. It\u2019s the sense of sleaziness. It\u2019s the sense of people out into the wee hours of the night drinking and just carrying on. And that energy is very much expressed in this painting especially.</p>\n",
