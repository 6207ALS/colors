As in Matisse\u2019s odalisques of a decade earlier, each of these works features a model stretched out on a sofa resting her head against her right hand. In front of her is circular table with a vase of flowers, sometimes violets but most often anemones. As in Matisse\u2019s odalisques of a decade earlier, the woman is surrounded by decorative fabrics, cushions, and wallpaper. Every individual painting constitutes a study in the effects of intense coloration and contrasting patterns and shapes that nonetheless result in a harmonious whole. His related drawings, composed of simple, fluid black lines without shading or modulation, are pure but intricate compositions enlivened by their clean paper supports. While made in different media, the drawings and paintings share a similarly elegant sense of space and animated composition.\n\nThe pen-and-ink drawing titled Study for Anemones and Woman (Study for \u201cOdalisque, Harmony in Blue\u201d) is closely related to a painting from this series, Odalisque, Harmony in Blue (1937; fig. 44\u201345.4) While the canvas depicts a full-length view of the woman, the drawing focuses more on the floral arrangement. In it, Matisse ended the composition at the woman's knees, crowded her face into the upper-right corner, and in an erotic twist, replaced her mouth with one of the blooms. The pewter jug holding the anemones was a favorite prop (see fig. 44\u201345.5), one to which Matisse devoted a 1917 painting (fig. 44\u201345.6) and included in works repeatedly thereafter. The curved lines of the body and the vertical lines of the neck have been aptly associated by art historian Jack Flam with \"the theme of growth, becoming, and vitality.\u201d Indeed, the drawing's linear arabesques have been described as nearly abstract, a reflection of the artist's interest in depicting the act of creation. Matisse often distinguished between what he considered preparatory and finished drawings at this time. He usually executed the latter category in pen and ink; thus, despite the use of the word \u201cstudy\u201d in the title, the artist may well have considered this lyrical sheet a complete work in its own right.\n\nAnemones continued to be a source of compositional interest to the artist for years to come. Anemones in a Vase from 1944 is a closely cropped and beautifully composed pen-and-ink image that retains the fluid immediacy of Matisse\u2019s hand, especially as the artist chose the smoother side of the paper for his composition and so enhanced the flow of his ink line across the it. The sheet was once owned by Dina Vierny, who is best remembered as the last model of sculptor and painter Aristide Maillol. During World War II, Vierny joined the resistance and helped guide refugees from France to Spain. After her arrest and acquittal, she traveled to safety in Nice on the recommendation of Maillol. There, she posed for Matisse and maintained a close relationship with him even after she returned to Maillol\u2019s Banyuls-sur-Mer studio on the Mediterranean. In 1947, with Matisse\u2019s encouragement, she opened a gallery in Paris. It is likely that Vierny acquired this work directly from Matisse, possibly the year it was made.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro and Brandon Ruud\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The work has had the following titles:\n\nMar.1939: Girl and Flowers (Art Institute of Chicago, The Eighteenth International Exhibition: Water Colors, Pastels, Drawings, and Monotypes, exh. cat.
