    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This bronze sculpture from around 1000 C.E. portrays Shiva Nataraja the Hindu god Shiva as lord of the dance. Madhuvanti Ghose is the Alsdorf curator of Indian and Islamic art at the Art Institute.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: The movement that is captured in this one moment where you have Shiva dancing within a circle of flames captures the moment when Shiva dances the T\u0101ndava nrtya or this dance of destruction in a forest which he sets alight with the energy from his dance. You can see Shiva caught in this moment with his hair flaying all around him. And the matted hair locks capture the goddess Gang\u0101 or the river Ganges on Shiva\u2019s right side.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The small figure of the goddess sits with folded hands her head just touching the outer circle. In Vishnu\u2019s raised left hand he holds a flame.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: While with the other raised arm on his right side he beats the drum as he\u2019s performing this dance of destruction. His lower right hand is raised in the Abhaya mudra or the \u201cdo not fear\u201d gesture. And he stamps on the demon of darkness, on Apasmara as he dances. This is perhaps one of the most iconic images from the Chola period. The holes that you see in the lotus pedestal at the bottom is where the rods would have gone through to hold this sculpture during a procession. It would have been carried high by the temple priests during processions so that the worshipers in the temple could see this amazing image.</p>\n",
