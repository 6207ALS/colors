They were shown in an enormous one-person exhibition held at Ambroise Vollard\u2019s gallery in November and December, which Pissarro attended. Writing to his daughter-in-law Esther Bensusan-Pissarro in November 1895, the artist complained about his finances and described his struggle to sell works against the backdrop of what he believed was a successful showing for his friend, ending the passage with praise and excitement for C\u00e9zanne\u2019s achievement:\n\nI have not contributed to the household finances for two months now, but I have a renewed sense of hope. There is a significantly considerable exhibition of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s works at Vollard\u2019s right now. There are stunningly rendered still lifes, and some other unfinished works[,] but they are truly breathtaking in their primitive character and authenticity. I don\u2019t think that many will fully appreciate what he has done.\n\nPerhaps Pissarro\u2019s hopefulness came from witnessing the accomplishment of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s works despite his friend\u2019s eighteen-year absence from the art scene. The success of the show must have been especially encouraging in light of his own series of bathers, which he began in early 1894. Pissarro already knew C\u00e9zanne\u2019s early bathers, not only because he must have seen them when he worked with the painter in the 1870s, but also because he already owned at least two from the 1860s and 1870s. On the occasion of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s 1895 solo show, Pissarro also traded one of his Louveciennes studies for two small works by C\u00e9zanne, one featuring bathers and one a self-portrait, attesting to Pissarro\u2019s appreciation of his friend\u2019s works and admiration of his aesthetic approach. As he said in a letter to his son Lucien,\n\nUpon leaving Portier\u2019s I thought of how rare it is to find real painters these days, who know how to juxtapose two colors . . . [ . . . ] I also thought about C\u00e9zanne\u2019s exhibition, where there are exquisite works on display; still lifes with an unrivalled finish and some others which are very overworked and yet abandoned midway in their execution, and even more beautiful than all the rest. There are landscapes, nudes, unfinished portraits and yet they are truly extravagant, so artistic and so graceful . . . How, you ask?? Because the feeling is there!\n\nInterestingly, Pissarro had a major influence on C\u00e9zanne\u2019s decision to hold a one-person show, pushing his friend for several months and even offering to lend some of his C\u00e9zannes. Pissarro may have also seen this as an opportunity to test the waters for his own bathers works, as he had not yet exhibited any of his own nudes by the time C\u00e9zanne\u2019s exhibition opened.\n\nPissarro began to study female bathers out of doors in a small series of paintings and prints completed in 1894. A smaller oil painting that might even be considered a study for the present work, The Foot Bath (fig. 14.1 [PDRS 1060]), is signed and dated 1894, like three other bather paintings [PDRS 1057, 1058, 1059], two etchings of female bathers, and one lithograph. They seem like summer pictures, but Pissarro was in Belgium for most of the summer and autumn of that year, far from landscapes like these along the Epte River, which flowed from his farm in \u00c9ragny to Monet\u2019s in Giverny. But as Pissarro tended not to paint his figural pictures from life but rather constructed them from drawings, it was not necessary for him to actually witness the scenes. The largest of the three bather compositions (fig. 14.2 [PDRS 1057]) relates directly to two etchings that Pissarro printed on a press he acquired in January 1894. It seems that he painted the 1894 Bathers (fig. 14.2) by inserting all the figures portrayed in his etchings and drawing\u2014including the woman immersed up to her shoulders in the background\u2014into the new work\u2019s composition (fig. 14.3, fig. 14.4, and fig. 14.5).\n\nIndeed, in a letter written to his son Lucien on January 14, 1894, he reported that he was making etchings of female bathers. Two of these relate precisely to the painting and to at least one preparatory drawing in the Ashmolean Museum (fig. 14.6). It is likely pure coincidence that before C\u00e9zanne\u2019s monographic exhibition opened at Vollard\u2019s, Pissarro had already painted a large series of his own with two principal canvases: the present work and an equally large study of three nude female bathers completed in 1896 (Three Bathers Stepping Out of the Water [PDRS 1108]). Although it is tempting to read this series as a kind of pictorial homage to C\u00e9zanne, it is likely that even the latter canvas was begun before he saw the C\u00e9zanne exhibition. In short, Pissarro\u2019s bathers seem to have been conceived independently of C\u00e9zanne and, in fact, evoke a range of artists from Fran\u00e7ois Boucher to Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir rather more than they do C\u00e9zanne. In the same January 1894 letter to Lucien, he also says that he is trying to paint new subjects and that \u201csix or seven canvases are very advanced.\u201d Tellingly, Pissarro also reports to his son that his wife is in Paris, subtly implying that it was possible for him to hire female models to pose in the nude without seeking her approval. Thus, what clearly seem to be \u201csummer\u201d pictures were, in all likelihood completed in the winter. Also, in a letter to Lucien dated January 15, 1896, before Pissarro left for his painting campaign in Rouen, he mentioned three works featuring bathers: \u201cI\u2019ve completed four size ten and fifteen canvases depicting Rosa. I\u2019ve also finished my three size thirty canvases of nudes; with all that I still have in terms of older works, the total amount of figure paintings should amount to about fifteen.\u201d\n\nWoman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook and the c. 1894\u201395Footbath (fig. 14.6) possess deep art-historical roots. The subject can be found in countless biblical pictures from the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but the most compelling connections are with the eighteenth-century paintings of Boucher and Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, who evoked similarly seductive rural women in superficially chaste but sexually charged scenes designed for male viewers (see fig. 14.7). The most frequently cited source for Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook is The Bather, an 1863 oil painting by Millet representing a young peasant woman tending geese (fig. 14.8). She has removed her clothes to wash in a calm river that is startlingly similar to the one in the Art Institute\u2019s work. Millet\u2019s painting was shown twice in 1886 and at a sale in Paris in 1892, but Pissarro\u2019s letters, usually very detailed in this regard, do not indicate that he viewed it at any of those venues. Although it is possible that he saw a reproduction, this is unlikely. Other inspiration could have come from Renoir\u2019s many female bathers of the later 1880s and early 1890s or, more likely, from Edgar Degas\u2019s late investigations of the nude, with which Pissarro was intimately familiar.\n\nIt is tempting to relate Millet\u2019s Bather to Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook, but it may be more persuasively connected to the nude cognate of this work by Pissarro, Bather (1895; fig. 14.9 [PDRS 1062]), with which it has more convincing, if undocumented, rhymes. The nude bather was painted on a smaller canvas, and no preparatory drawing for it survives. This makes it difficult to ascertain just how Pissarro transformed the clothed version into a nude, as he must have done because The Foot Bath (fig. 14.1) is clearly the instigator of the sequence. The poses, too, diverge enough so as not to be directly related. This may indicate, however, that Pissarro\u2019s working process was gradual, and he found inspiration in his own works when creating his series, as his letters from 1894 suggest. In a January 1894 note to Lucien, the artist announced his plan to begin his bathers, and he often alluded to working on the same nudes throughout that year. By late November 1894 he described his careful finishing and incessant reworking of his bathers series, even detailing how he was still trying to perfect one work after eight months.\n\nSince we know that the clothed bather was already in Dresden at an exhibition in February 1895 and that the nude had sold in October 1895, it is certain that the former painting was made late in 1894 or early in 1895, well before Pissarro\u2019s departure for Belgium in June, and begun as early as the etchings of bathers created in the studio in January 1894. The large-scale colored chalk study with pastel highlights in the Ashmolean Museum (fig. 14.6) was most likely created after The Foot Bath (fig. 14.1), and seems to have been drawn from a local model who posed in Pissarro\u2019s studio. Pissarro obviously studied the drawing as he worked on the painting, but there is no physical evidence that he transferred it from paper to canvas as his younger colleague Paul Gauguin often did. Furthermore, although the painting and the pastel are very similar, there are enough differences in the figure\u2019s pose to rule out such a transfer. Rather, the drawing seems to have been a graphic exercise meant to facilitate the drawing on the canvas\u2014undoubtedly made with the pastel, not the model herself, in front of him.\n\nThe rugged, physically varied surface and the numerous subtle changes to the figure and her clothing, indicated by the thick buildup of paint visible in details and in the X-ray (see fig. 14.10 and fig. 14.11), make it clear that Pissarro worked on the canvas over months. It undoubtedly pleased him, because he sent it to two exhibitions in Germany early in 1895, suggesting that he signed and dated it in January of that year. Hence, it is possible that the nude Bather (fig. 14.9) was also largely painted in 1894, because the two works may have been created at the same moment. Sadly, neither painting has had much traction in the Pissarro bibliography or in the many exhibitions of his oeuvre. This surely results from the fact that, for so many people who look at them, their 1895 date links them to C\u00e9zanne\u2019s much more advanced paintings of bathers. Pissarro\u2019s aims thus have been misunderstood in precisely the same ways that his early 1880s figure paintings were misunderstood by being linked to Millet\u2019s. Indeed, his complex, layered working method and his stubborn refusal to develop his art in a linear manner meant that his output\u2014particularly the figurative portion\u2014was destined to be compared to the works of his peers and predecessors rather than to be assessed in its own right. Yet we must remember that the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel and the Pissarro family, in choosing a large group of his most successful paintings and works on silk and paper for his posthumous retrospective at Durand-Ruel, Paris, elected to include the present work. It was successful there, as it seems to have been purchased in connection with the exhibition.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro began with a contour sketch in dilute blue paint on a commercially primed, standard-size canvas with a white ground. The artist built up compositional elements within the sketched lines, leaving a thin, almost unpainted border along the edges of forms that is quite clear in the X-ray. There are changes to the figure\u2019s hairstyle and the angle of her head, in addition to a number of changes to the volume, distribution, and position of the skirt. Throughout the painting process, the artist continually added more fabric to the front of the figure\u2019s skirt, while reducing volume at the back and side. As a result, the figure\u2019s legs became more covered with each successive alteration. In order to make changes to the composition, Pissarro executed a new contour sketch in thin blue paint directly over the earlier compositional choices before continuing; this is evident throughout the figure. The painting has a great deal of texture, as he used primarily soft brushes with thick, paste-like paint to drag layers of paint across the surface hitting only the high points of the underlying texture and exaggerating it. Near the end of the painting process, the artist dragged a stiffer brush across the soft paint in the foreground to create the illusion of the glassy surface of the brook. The work is currently unvarnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 14.12).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro 1895 (lower left, in brown-red paint) (fig. 14.13, fig. 14.14).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen.\n\nThe original size of the canvas was approximately 72.5 \u00d7 92 cm, measuring from the original foldover. This probably corresponds to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard size (92 \u00d7 73 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation) 26.1V (0.8) \u00d7 22.8H (0.7) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp, and the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the weft.\n\nLight cusping on all sides corresponds to original tack holes, while stronger, primary cusping at the right and top is evidence of commercial preparation. The weft thread-count deviation map indicates a small area of more loosely woven canvas about 1 cm wide approximately one-third of the canvas\u2019s height from the top (fig. 14.15).\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting was lined in past treatment and its dimensions slightly increased on all sides.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 4.5\u20137 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The work is currently stretched in a five-member ICA spring stretcher with a vertical crossbar. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nPrevious stretcher: A pre-lining examination notes the work was stretched on a four-member mortise-and-key stretcher; it is unclear if that stretcher was original. Depth: Unknown.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: canvas verso, obscured by lining (transcribed in Conservation File)  \nMethod: stamp  \nContent: [P. Contet / PARIS]\n\nNot determined.\n\nThe ground is very smooth, filling much of the relatively fine canvas weave, and appears commercially applied and appears to be a single layer (fig. 14.16). The preparation extends to the edges of the tacking margins on the left and bottom edges, stopping short of the edges at top and right; the softness along the edges of the preparation on the latter two sides suggests application with a soft brush (see fig. 14.17).\n\nThe ground appears white, with no colored particles visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 14.18). Visual examination of a cross section of the ground and canvas reveals traces of black, yellow-orange, and red particles.\n\nXRF analysis indicates that the ground is composed of predominantly lead white with small amounts of iron oxides and calcium compounds, such as calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nThe extent of underdrawing is not entirely clear due to the thickness of the paint layer, but microscopic examination indicates the figure was sketched in paint prior to execution.\n\nPissarro used thin blue paint to sketch the figure; some of this is left visible along the edges of forms (see fig. 14.19).\n\nWhile there are no discernible differences between the sketched and painted compositions, most compositional changes to the figure in the painting stage were outlined in dilute blue paint directly over the previous forms before execution (see fig. 14.20). For specific compositional changes, see Paint Layer.\n\nThis painting is heavily and meticulously worked, and Pissarro made numerous small changes to the composition while slowly building up a thick impasto in a series of wet-in-wet campaigns. He began with a contour sketch and often strictly followed this guide, executing each compositional choice fully before making alterations. Each form is articulated within its blue outline, leaving a small margin of thin paint between the edges of forms that often exposes the underdrawing and is visible in the X-ray and transmitted-light images. The head and hair of the figure appear to be the most labored areas of the painting, appearing quite radio-opaque in the X-ray. The infrared image indicates changes to the back of the figure\u2019s neck and her hairstyle; either her bun was originally slightly lower on her head or the style was looser and more elongated (see fig. 14.21). In the X-ray evidence can be seen of small changes in both the area of the bun and of the figure\u2019s profile. Close examination of the painting\u2019s surface reveals that the artist reduced the size and volume of the figure\u2019s hair at the back by bringing in additional background paint to hem it in (see fig. 14.22). The X-ray also reveals that the figure\u2019s nose was slightly higher originally and displayed a different profile. Under the microscope, flesh tones from the original nose are still visible under the grass, as is the artist\u2019s second underdrawing directly on top of it (fig. 14.23).\n\nPissarro also made numerous changes to the figure\u2019s skirt, possibly trying multiple versions before settling on the visible arrangement. The X-ray indicates that the figure\u2019s dress was first slightly bunched up behind her, spreading further onto the grass, rather than neatly tucked underneath her as in the present composition. Originally the right edge of the skirt was more voluminous; its browns, purples, and blues can be seen between the green dabs of paint articulating the grass. As he did in the figure\u2019s hair, here the artist amended the skirt by covering the excess volume with additional background paint (see fig. 14.24). Initially the skirt was arranged with a greater volume of fabric on the side, while the figure\u2019s legs were left more exposed. Although the amount of skirt behind and beside the figure may have been greater at the outset, the amount of fabric covering her legs was much less. Combining information from various technical images, it appears that the artist moved the skirt three or four different times, covering more and more of the leg down to the knee. Raking light and X-ray examinations indicate that at one time the skirt may have reached above the cuff of the figure\u2019s sleeve, almost as high as her elbow, draping across her lap and exposing much of her left leg. If so, the skirt would have stopped at what is now the first of many light-colored folds above the knee (see fig. 14.25). Small voids in the upper paint layers in this area reveal the initial flesh tones from this first configuration (see fig. 14.26). Over time, the artist added folds in additional pale colors to cover the figure\u2019s legs first; next he added volume along the figure\u2019s left side, as seen in transmitted infrared and raking light; then he incorporated additional pinks and mauve tones across the lap (see the reflected and transmitted infrared images) that connect to a dark purple fold at the right; and finally he added the lightest tones across the thigh and to the right of the figure.\n\nThe painting was meticulously executed with relatively small brushes and a thick, paste-like paint consistency. Each layer was dragged over the underlying texture, catching the high points and reinforcing the texture, resulting in an almost pebbly surface (see fig. 14.27). In the foreground, Pissarro dragged a dry brush across the still-soft paint to create the horizontal highlights and indicate the movement and reflective qualities of the water (see fig. 14.28).\n\nRelatively fine, soft-bristle brushes with strokes up to 0.5 cm.\n\nXRF analysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white; vermilion; iron oxide red, yellow, and/or brown; chrome yellow; cobalt blue, emerald green; and possibly viridian. Visual observation and stereomicroscopic examination suggest the presence of red lake (fig. 14.29) and black (fig. 14.30).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work is currently unvarnished, with residues of natural-resin varnish in the depressions of the paint layer and around areas of impasto.\n\nIn 1981 the painting was examined while in the collection of its previous owner, where it was noted to be unlined, stretched on a four-member mortise-and-key stretcher with slightly warped members, and a yellow, probably natural-resin varnish. The work was subsequently cleaned, wax-resin lined, stretched on a redwood spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions, and given a synthetic Soluvar varnish. In 2000, upon acquisition by the Art Institute, the painting was noted to have a stable wax-resin lining and a five-member ICA spring stretcher. The restretched dimensions were noted as slightly larger than the original, and pinholes were present in the corners of the canvas. Some flattening of the impasto, probably as a result of the lining, and a glossy, probably synthetic varnish were also documented. The painting was treated shortly after this examination, in 2001; the varnish was removed and the work received minor retouching around the edges.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition, wax-resin lined, planar, and with few cracks or losses. It is unvarnished, with residues of discolored natural resin in the interstices and depressions of the paint film, and has a margin of retouching around the edges, especially along the top. Old pinholes in three corners have been filled and inpainted.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, c. 1980 stylization of a Louis XIII or Louis XIV transitional frame, cushion framed with projecting fanned lambrequin and flower corners, running-leaf sight molding, and an independent fillet liner. The frame has water and oil gilding over red bole on gesso. The gilding is heavily rubbed on the ornament and rails and toned overall. The carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed, and glued to a back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ovolo with half patera; cove side; cushion face with projecting fanned lambrequin and flower corners on a quadrillage bed, connected by plain reposes; sanded frieze; ovolo sight molding with running-leaf ornament on a straight-lined bed; and an independent fillet liner (fig. 14.31).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1970): The work was previously housed in what appears to have been a reproduction of a Louis XV reverse ogee frame with swept sides, anthemia corner and shell center cartouches connected by foliate rocaille ornament, and an independent linen-covered liner. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ovolo with dentil; scotia side; reverse ogee face with projecting and pierced anthemia corner and shell center cartouches on diamond beds, connected by swept scroll sides with foliate rocaille ornament on the face; sanded frieze; ogee sight molding; and an independent fillet liner (fig. 14.32).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired from [unknown] by Albert Pontremoli, Paris, by Apr. 1904.\n\nSold at the Albert Pontremoli Sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, June 11, 1924, lot 136 (ill.) to Dr. Janos Plesch, Berlin, for 37,700 francs.\n\nAcquired by Paul Rosenberg and Co., New York, by 1939.\n\nSold by Paul Rosenberg and Co., New York, to Mrs. John Astor, New York.\n\nAcquired by E. and A.

The Art Institute currently uses a title that is based on the one used by the artist when describing the Art Institute\u2019s painting to his son Lucien in a letter dated December 14, 1894, and on research conducted for the 2008 exhibition The Impressionists: Master Paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago. For the letter see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 521 (letter 1080).\n\nThe painting was dated 1894/95 based on research conducted for the 2008 exhibition The Impressionists: Master Paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago. This date includes the inscribed date of 1895 and indicates that Pissarro may have begun the painting in the latter part of 1894, which is suggested by letters from the artist to his son Lucien. See Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 513 (letter 1073), 521 (letter 1080).\n\nJohn Rewald, C\u00e9zanne, A Biography (Abrams, 1986), pp. 189, 207\u201308, 269.

At the third Impressionist exhibition in 1877, C\u00e9zanne showed one work depicting bathers, which, according to Ruth Berson, has not been identified with certainty. See Ruth Berson, ed., The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 2, Exhibited Works (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, 1996), p. 71. After showing with the Impressionists in 1874 and 1877, C\u00e9zanne\u2019s next exhibition was a monographic one at Ambroise Vollard\u2019s gallery, which ran from November to December 1895.\n\n\u201c\u00c0 la maison, je n\u2019ai rien donn\u00e9 depuis deux mois, cependant j\u2019ai un peu d\u2019espoir.

The only work featuring nude bathers that was exhibited in the late nineteenth century was PDRS 1108, Three Bathers Stepping Out of the Water (1896). It was shown for the first time at Pissarro\u2019s solo show in 1896 at Durand-Ruel, Paris, which ran from April 15 to May 9, 1896. See also PDRS, vol. 1, p. 364. Of Pissarro\u2019s entire bathers series (both his dressed figures and nudes), only the Art Institute\u2019s painting was exhibited before C\u00e9zanne\u2019s monographic exhibition took place; it appeared in Dresden and Berlin in the early months of 1895.\n\nFor the etchings see PDRS, vol. 3, p. 675. For the lithograph see PDRS, vol. 3, p. 679. There also exist two other versions: the pencil, ink, and wash The Two Bathers (Ashmolean Museum Oxford; see PDRS vol. 3, p. 675) and the gouache Peasant Crossing a Brook (c. 1894; Wildenstein Institute Archives, Paris; see PDRS, vol. 3, p. 676). Pissarro also created a colored-chalk version with pastel highlights entitled The Foot Bath, which shows a figure that is almost exactly the same as that in the Art Institute\u2019s 1895 painting.\n\nFor these works see PDRS, vol. 3, p. 675; and Richard Brettell and Christopher Lloyd, A Catalogue of the Drawings by Camille Pissarro in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Clarendon, 1980), cat. 294. There also exists a charcoal preparatory drawing by Pissarro of the nude woman bending forward without any other compositional elements (1894/95; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). It measures 288 \u00d7 223 mm. See Richard Brettell and Christopher Lloyd, A Catalogue of the Drawings by Camille Pissarro in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Clarendon, 1980), cat. 257, p. 185.\n\nCamille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Jan. 14, 1894, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 418\u201319.\n\nCamille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Jan. 14, 1894, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 418\u201319.\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai termin\u00e9 quatre toiles de dix et quinze d\u2019apr\u00e8s la Rosa, j\u2019ai aussi termin\u00e9 mes trois toiles de trente, nus; avec ce que j\u2019ai d\u2019anciennes choses, cela me fera une quinzaine de tableaux de figures.\u201d Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Jan. 15, 1896, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 4, 1895\u20131898 (Valhermeil, 1989), p. 149. See PDRS 1061, 1108, vol. 3, pp. 678, 699. The no. 30 portrait standard-size canvas measured 92 \u00d7 73 cm. Two of Pissarro\u2019s paintings featuring bathers from 1895 and 1896 correspond to these dimensions: the Art Institute\u2019s Woman Bathing Her Feet in a Brook (73.5 \u00d7 92 cm) and a later work, Three Bathers Stepping out of the Water (1896; PDRS 1108; 74 \u00d7 92 cm). None of the remaining works featuring bathers listed in PDRS correspond to the dimensions of this third painting mentioned in Pissarro\u2019s January 1896 letter to Lucien; all of the remaining bathers created between 1894 and 1896 that are listed are smaller.\n\nMillet\u2019s painting was exhibited in conjunction with the John Saulnier estate sales in 1886 and 1892. Both times, the work was shown to the public the day before the sale took place. When the work failed to sell after Saulnier\u2019s death in 1886, it\u2014along with eleven other paintings\u2014was exhibited in March 1892 at the Sedelmeyer Gallery in Paris, where it finally sold. See Vente apr\u00e8s d\u00e9c\u00e8s: Collection de vente John Saulnier de Bordeaux; tableaux modernes de premier ordre; Vente H\u00f4tel Drouot, le samedi 5 juin, 1886 (Haro Fr\u00e8res, 1886); and Collection John Saulnier de Bordeaux: 12 tableaux modernes de premier ordre; Galerie Sedelmeyer, le vendredi 25 mars, 1892 (P. Chevalier, 1892).\n\nIt seems that Millet\u2019s painting was only reproduced in conjunction with two estate sales, in 1886 and 1892, perhaps not easily accessible to Pissarro. The first reproduction appeared in an estate sale catalogue after the death of the painting\u2019s owner, John Saulnier (lot 64, estimated at 29,100 francs). It did not sell. In 1892 at the Sedelmeyer gallery in Paris, the painting sold for 48,000 francs to one Mr. Engel. For this sale see La Chronique des beaux-arts et de la curiosit\u00e9: suppl\u00e9ment de la Gazette des Beaux-Arts, no. 14 (Apr. 2, 1892). Millet\u2019s painting was reproduced in Vente apr\u00e8s d\u00e9c\u00e8s, Collection de vente John Saulnier de Bordeaux: tableaux modernes de premier ordre; Vente H\u00f4tel Drouot, le samedi 5 juin, 1886 (Haro Fr\u00e8res, 1886), lot 64, p. 44. In each sale catalogue, the painting\u2019s 1886 and 1892 sale prices are penciled in next to the catalogue entry. See also Collection John Saulnier de Bordeaux, 12 tableaux modernes de premier ordre: Galerie Sedelmeyer, le vendredi 25 mars, 1892 (P. Chevalier, 1892), lot 10, p. 14. The Art Institute sold the 1892 Saulnier sale catalogue that year. The painting, however, never appeared in Millet\u2019s 1875 estate sale catalogue because it was purchased directly from the artist by his Belgian dealers, Ennemond Blanc and Arthur Stevens, in the early 1860s. See Catalogue de la vente qui aura lieu par suite du d\u00e9c\u00e8s de Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00f4tel Drouot les lundi 10 et mardi 11 mai, 1875 \u00e0 deux heures (Alcan-L\u00e9vy, 1875). For Millet\u2019s business relationship with Blanc and Stevens, who commissioned works directly from the artist for three years (1860\u201363), see Alexandra R. Murphy, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet: Drawn into the Light (Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 1999), p. 32. The contract stipulated that Millet would produce twenty-five paintings in return for a monthly stipend over a period of three years. See also \u201cMillets in the Art Institute,\u201d Bulletin of the Art Institute of Chicago 43, 7 (Oct. 1924), pp. 87\u201388, for Millet\u2019s three-year business deal with Blanc and Stevens.\n\nFor Degas\u2019s series of nudes exhibited at the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886, see Ruth Berson, ed., The New Painting: Impressionism, 1874\u20131886, vol. 2, Exhibited Works (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco/University od Washington Press, 1996), pp. 240\u201341, 258\u201359.\n\nIn a letter dated November 5, 1894, to his son Lucien from \u00c9ragny, Pissarro opened with his announcement of a completed gouache entitled Gardeuse d\u2019oies. See published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 503. This work is PV 1475; see also PV vol. 1, p. 285. Despite the similarity of their titles, Pissarro\u2019s gouache bears no compositional resemblance to Millet\u2019s painting Goose Girl. See also PDRS 1061, 1062, vol. 3, p. 678. The precise relationship between the nude and the clothed variants of the same composition is difficult to ascertain without a comparable comprehensive technical investigation of the Metropolitan\u2019s picture.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s letters from 1894 see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 418\u2013527. The painting worked on by Pissarro for over eight months is Peasant Girl Fording a Brook (PDRS 1059). Pissarro mentioned still working on this painting in two letters to his son Lucien, one from Paris dated November 22 and another from \u00c9ragny dated November 30, 1894, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, pp. 513, 516. In the second letter, Pissarro complained that he had made many alterations to the painting but that he was still not happy with it despite having started it the previous winter. Pissarro also made a gouache version of this work (Peasant Girl Fording a Brook; PDRS 1059) in circa 1894. In the November 22, 1894, letter to his son Lucien, when describing his obsessive reworking of this painting for most of the year, Pissarro also mentions working simultaneously on the Art Institute\u2019s painting. When comparing these works, including the Indianapolis and Metropolitan paintings (PDRS 1059\u201362), it becomes clear that one idea may have led to another, as the bathers in all of them have their feet immersed in shallow pools of water. Aside from the nude version at the Metropolitan, the figures in the other works are all wearing full skirts with clearly discernible slips, demonstrating Pissarro\u2019s gradual working process on his bathers series.\n\nPDRS, vol. 3, p. 678; see also PDRS, vol. 1, p. 364, for its exhibition history. For the provenance of the Metropolitan\u2019s picture see PDRS, vol. 3, pp. 678\u201379. The Metropolitan\u2019s picture was sold by Pissarro in Paris to Tadamasa Hayashi in Tokyo through Alphonse Portier, on October 20, 1895, but only exhibited for the first time at the Metropolitan March 10\u2013November 2, 1930. See Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, October 25, 1894, and Paris, November 22, 1894, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), pp. 498\u201399, 513. In the letter dated October 1894 Pissarro alludes to his series of nudes of \u201csize 30 canvases\u201d and states that they were taking up all of his time. According to Bailly-Herzberg\u2019s note, the Art Institute\u2019s painting, although dated 1895, was surely one of the works in the bathers series preoccupying Pissarro in 1894, as it is the only no. 30 portrait standard-size canvas featuring bathers from this period. In the November letter Pissarro seems to allude once again to the Art Institute\u2019s painting, mentioning a Little Peasant on a no. 30 standard-size canvas. He says it is coming along but not quite finished, still lacking a certain something, but that it would soon be finished with the right inspiration. This implies that Pissarro may have been working on the painting throughout the year and in conjunction with other works featuring bathers. By mid-December 1894 Pissarro announced to his son Lucien that he was already planning on sending four or five paintings to Dresden and had tentatively decided which four to send (the list included the Art Institute\u2019s picture), unless he changed his mind at the last minute, which indicates that Pissarro may still have been adding final touches to the work in early 1895. See Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Dec. 14, 1894, published in Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894, p. 521.\n\nSee Richard Brettell and Christopher Lloyd, A Catalogue of the Drawings by Camille Pissarro in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Clarendon, 1980), no. 259, p. 186. Interestingly, this preparatory chalk and pastel study is bigger than the Indianapolis Foot Bath of 1894 but smaller than the Art Institute\u2019s of 1895.\n\nSee fig. 14.9 and the figure studies in Richard Brettell and Christopher Lloyd, A Catalogue of the Drawings by Camille Pissarro in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (Clarendon, 1980), pp. 185-86, cat. 257, 259. The chalk-and-pastel preparatory study (fig. 14.6, cat. 259)\u2014due to its large size when compared with the other figure study by Pissarro (cat. 257)\u2014may have been used by the artist in a way similar to his large preparatory drawing for the Art Institute\u2019s painting Young Peasant Having Her Coffee of 1881 (cat. 10). The Art Institute also owns the drawing, only a few centimeters smaller than its painted cognate (cat. 9).\n\nFor the painting\u2019s appearances in Germany, see PDRS, vol. 1, p. 364. The Art Institute\u2019s painting was exhibited in Dresden at the Ernst Arnold Gallery from an unknown date in February to March 2, 1895, and again in Berlin at the gallery of Fritz Gurlitt from March 21 to April 15, 1895. See Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Oct. 25, 1894, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 3, 1891\u20131894 (Valhermeil, 1988), p. 498\u201399. In this letter Pissarro described to his son his preoccupation with the series of nudes that he had already started that year. In the first note to this letter Bailly-Herzberg identifies the Art Institute\u2019s painting as the \u201ccanvas size 30\u201d mentioned by Pissarro, dated 1895 but started in 1894. She also identified the Metropolitan\u2019s picture as another one of the works in his series of nudes begun in 1894, indicating a working relationship between the Art Institute\u2019s bather and its nude cognate.\n\nFor C\u00e9zanne\u2019s late bathers, see Mary Louise Krumrine, Paul C\u00e9zanne: The Bathers (Abrams, 1989), pp. 167\u2013205.\n\nFor some of the reviews of Pissarro\u2019s works from the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882, which linked the artist almost exclusively with the art of Millet, see the entry on Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (cat. 10), which translates many of the critics\u2019 comments.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s painting was posthumously exhibited along with 131 other works at Durand-Ruel, Paris, April 7\u201330, 1904, only a few months after the artist\u2019s death. See PDRS, vol. 1, p. 366.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests the signature is a complex mixture containing iron oxide brown and yellow and vermilion. The presence of iron and mercury was confirmed with XRF. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_WBathingBrook\\_1999\\_364\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOriginal dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation. See the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report Woman Bathing her Feet in a Brook, 1895 (PS1061/1999.364),\u201d Dec. 2012.\n\nThe ground layer along these two sides only partially covers the tacking margins, leaving a small margin of unprimed canvas on the verso. These unprimed margins, in conjunction with the heavy cusping, probably indicate that this section of canvas came from a corner of a larger roll that had been commercially prepared. For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46; and Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists, exh. cat. (Skira, 2008), p. 52.\n\nObservation by Don Johnson. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report Woman Bathing her Feet in a Brook, 1895 (PS1061/1999.364),\u201d Dec. 2012.\n\nDespite this documentation, faint stretcher-bar cracks suggest the painting was for some time stretched on a five-member stretcher with a vertical crossbar. See Barry Bauman, \u201cExamination Report: Woman Washing Her Legs by Camille Pissarro, 1980.3,\u201d Sept. 1980, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nWhile not currently visible in transmitted-light or transmitted-infrared, the painting was noted to have a color merchant\u2019s stamp that reads P. Contet. Paris on the verso prior to lining in 1981. P. Contet, formerly Latouche, was located at 34, rue Lafayette. See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46 (2001), p. 64. This stamp was also found on Pissarro\u2019s Haymaking in \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12) and The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13). See St\u00e9phanie Constantin, \u201cThe Barbizon Painters: A Guide to Their Suppliers,\u201d Studies in Conservation 46 (2001), p. 64; see also Barry Bauman, \u201cExamination Report: Woman Washing Her Legs by Camille Pissarro, 1980.3,\u201d Sept. 1980, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlthough glue-based sizing layers are common in commercial preparation, no such layer was visible in stereomicroscopic examination of the painting. In addition, a thinly applied sizing layer could have been absorbed by the canvas and may not be visible under the current circumstances. Cross-sectional analysis would be needed to confirm the presence of a sizing layer.\n\nVisual analysis of cross sections suggests the ground is a single layer. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nVisual analysis of cross sections verified the presence of a white ground layer with traces of black, yellow-orange, and red particles visible in the matrix. XRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments (including carbon blacks), if present. Further analysis would be needed to confirm the presence and specific type of black. See Inge Fiedler, microanalysis results summary, May 5, 2015; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_WBathingBrook\\_1999\\_364\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2012, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon, aluminum, and phosphorus. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_WBathingBrook\\_1999\\_364\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nSmall holes, extant in three corners and visible in the X-ray but now partially filled and inpainted, may indicate the use of spacers, or taquets bois, between painting campaigns. Possible evidence of these spacers is also seen on Pissarro\u2019s Rabbit Warren at Pontoise, Snow (1879; cat. 8), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10), Woman and Child at the Well (1882; cat. 11), and The Place du Havre, Paris (1893; cat. 13). For a discussion of taquets bois, see Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), pp. 92\u201393. Similar pinholes were also found on Pissarro\u2019s The Quays at Rouen (1883; Courtauld Institute, London); see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 5.\n\nAn example of this longer, looser hairstyle may be seen in a related painting from the previous year, Young Woman Washing Her Feet in a Brook (1894; Indianapolis Museum of Art; fig. 14.1 [PDRS 1060]).\n\nWhile not as voluminous, the original configuration of the skirt, with excess fabric behind the figure and the skirt pulled up well above her knee, is very similar to two other versions of the same subject, the oil-on-canvas The Foot Bath (1894; Indianapolis Museum of Art; fig. 14.1) and the monotype A Young Woman Washing Her Feet at the Edge of a Stream (c. 1894\u201395; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; fig. 14.9 [PDRS 1060]).\n\nThe height of the skirt was similar to that seen in the related colord-chalk-and-pastel drawing Study of a Young Woman Bathing Her Legs (1895; Ashmolean Museum). The angle of the figure\u2019s back, the tucked-under skirt behind her, the slightly bent arms, and the three-quarter-length sleeves also very closely recall this drawing (see fig. 14.6).\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments (including lake pigments and carbon blacks), if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (components of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_WBathingBrook\\_1999\\_364\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Nov. 15, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), pp. 1\u201316; and David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art In the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 72\u201375.\n\nBy the early 1880s Pissarro appears to have been very much against varnishing, preferring to exhibit works under glass, as in the seventh Impressionist exhibition in 1882. Some works, such as The Village of \u00c9ragny (1885; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) feature a typed note from Pissarro\u2019s daughter-in-law Esther expressing both Lucien and Camille\u2019s general distaste for varnish. On the verso of Landscape at Chaponval (1880; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris), the artist wrote, \u201cplease do not varnish this picture / C. Pissarro\u201d. For discussion of Pissarro\u2019s varnishing practices see Michael Swicklick, \u201cFrench Painting and the Use of Varnish, 1750\u20131900,\u201d Conservation Research: Studies in the History of Art 41, 2 (1993), pp. 168\u201369.
