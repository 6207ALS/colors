In contrast, the minimal effort and commitment required to make prints must have been a welcome \u201crest,\u201d as he had termed his similar transition to sculpture from painting. Graphic media\u2019s potential for monochromatic treatment and compositional reduction also complemented the path the artist would continue to take in his painting. Since he could complete plates quickly and transport them easily, printmaking would have been a prudent choice up through the end of December of that year, when he was contemplating whether to return to Morocco for a third time. As it turned out, Matisse decided to stay in Paris and rent a studio on the quai Saint-Michel instead; this led him to commit himself to a sustained exploration of printmaking, and he even purchased a hand etching press for his own use. Indeed, printmaking came to have a special place in his artistic practice: his daughter, Marguerite, recalled that he often executed prints at the conclusion of an arduous painting session; from eyewitness accounts, we also know that he employed them during breaks, as instruments of relief or synthesis.\n\nAll these elements came together in Matisse\u2019s monotypes, a hybrid form of printmaking in which he applied ink to a copper plate and then lightly scratched it away with a pointed tool to make an image that was then printed on China paper as a single, unique impression. For these he had to work quickly, while the ink was still wet, running the plate through the press smoothly since the image was delicate, inscribed only into the surface of the ink and not the plate. Marguerite, who often assisted her father in the studio, recalled the importance of this process to the artist and the \u201cgreat moment of emotion at the instant when one discovered the imprint on the sheet of paper.\u201d If monotypes further sharpened Matisse\u2019s efforts to simplify outlines, suppress details, and condense forms, they also offered techniques and effects that he could translate directly back to his canvases. The reverse of a traditional print, in which inked lines sit on an unprinted paper, the monotype relies on lines that read against a black field with a brilliant crispness and physicality. Matisse could employ these marks to suggest delicacy and softness or weight and solidity.\n\nHis experience of scratching\u2014almost carving\u2014into black, removing medium and investing the inky field with a sense of volume, depth, and even illumination would be carried into his paintings. Indeed, it was in 1914\u2014the same year the artist made his first monotype\u2014that he fully employed black and incising on a canvas, an approach that reached its initial dramatic culmination in Portrait of Yvonne Landsberg (June\u2013mid-July 1914; Philadelphia Museum of Art). Matisse\u2019s translation of techniques from printmaking to painting, however, was not unreciprocal: although we do not know how much he reworked his prints, we can find instances of an inky finger tapped lightly over a reconsidered line on a plate (see fig. 21\u201322.1) or ink brushed on an impression to clarify a form. The physical nature of making a monotype satisfied his overall interest in surface and depth in his works as well as his own ability to leave a trace of their evolution as a part of their final form.\n\nMonotypes also present a fascinating window onto Matisse\u2019s working process. He could repeatedly explore a potential composition for a canvas or isolate elements, reshaping and comparing their essential contours before proceeding with an adjustment in the painting. In a dramatic example, the Art Institute\u2019s two works, Still Life with Goldfish III and V\u2014part of a group of six monotypes from 1914\u201315 (see fig. 21\u201322.2, fig. 21\u201322.3, fig. 21\u201322.4, and fig. 21\u201322.5) related to the canvases Interior with Goldfish (Jan.\u2013mid-Mar. 1914; fig. 21\u201322.6) and Goldfish and Palette (late Nov. 1914\u2013early spring 1915; fig. 21\u201322.7), demonstrate how keenly he examined individual objects, testing the details for potential elimination and studying the still life from various angles and distances, and in different intensities of light. In this period, Matisse\u2019s monotypes paralleled the subjects of some of his most challenging paintings and were deeply connected to their making. This is likely the reason why later, in 1917, as he began to shift away from his experimental mode of working, he also stopped making them.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This entry is adapted from Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro, \u201cPrints,\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and John Elderfield, Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, exh. cat.
