    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: A Roman sculptor of the first century B.C. made this marble copy of a fourth century B.C. statue. The original is attributed to Greek master sculptor and architect Scopas. Together with Praxiteles, Scopas helped to define the late classical era in Greek sculpture. In particular, he established emotional expression as a theme in art. This nude figure\u2019s cloak thrown over the left arm adds a note of restlessness to the figure. The statue portrays Meleager a mighty hunter in Greek mythology. The tall stump beside the figure may allude to Meleager\u2019s fate to die when a particular log was burned. Most probably the sculptor added it to support the heavy marble figure. The original by Scopas showed the hero leaning on his spear with the head of the Caledonian boar on a stump to his left.</p>\n",
