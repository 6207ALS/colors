    "description": "<p>Adam Elsheimer\u2019s small paintings on copper show his remarkable ability to create imaginary, highly composed landscapes. On his arrival in Rome in 1600, Elsheimer was inspired by the city\u2019s antique monuments and its extraordinary artistic environment. In this work, the wooded landscape teeming with wildlife is indebted to painting from Northern Europe, while the youthful saint echoes ancient Greek and Roman sculpture in a pose that reveals both his active mind and his physical strength. Though Elsheimer died in Rome at a relatively young age, his painting profoundly influenced his fellow artists, including <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36487/peter-paul-rubens\">Peter Paul Rubens</a>.</p>\n",
