In the mounting process, however, the present sheet was misaligned and ended up beneath the adjacent sheet, 4H, by approximately three centimeters. As a correction, at center top, Ensor reworked the staff held by the figure in folio 3H/I (see fig. 1). Along the left edge, various campaigns of blue colored pencil offer further evidence that the orientation of the sheets was changed before mounting. Pinholes at center top and in the surrounding sheets suggest the group was attached to a drawing surface earlier in the production process. Touches of bright vermilion gouache highlight the shoes of the figure at the top, which, like his attributes in folio 3H/I, may indicate a religious role. SMC/KJN\n\nEnsor\u2019s fascination with the visual energy produced by the contrasts of light and dark and the interaction of his figures within pictorial space is reflected in both this sheet and the print Capture of a Strange Town (fig. 2; see also sheets 3F, 3G, 3H/I, 4F, 4G, and 4H). Indeed, the artist was constantly preoccupied by light and space. Ensor had a strong memory for composition and design; the work of other artists seems to have frequently stuck with him and been integrated into his own oeuvre. Closer consideration of Capture of a Strange Town reveals a probable source for its composition: the mezzotint Belshazzar\u2019s Feast by John Martin, an English Romantic artist and favorite of King Leopold I of Belgium (fig. 3). The explosion of the elements and fantastical landscapes lie at the heart of Martin\u2019s biblical scenes, which exhibit an energy that clearly left its mark on Ensor. The Belgian artist likely saw Martin\u2019s work in Ernest Chesneau\u2019s La peinture anglaise (English Painting; A. Quantin, 1882), as he copied several works from this book.
