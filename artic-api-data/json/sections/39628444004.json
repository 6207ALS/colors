Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThis is one of four in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints that depict Tahitian subjects. The other three are Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Women, Animals, and Foliage (cat. 97), and Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98). These thematically related works can stand on their own pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThis oblong-shaped composition includes a border of botanical elements that constitute a framing device\u2014flowers and leaves placed at intervals along the bottom, a long tree branch with foliage extending across the top. While the left edge has no such feature, along the right edge rises a tree trunk, which seems to indicate an emphatic end to the frieze of images to which this image belongs. At the juncture between trunk and branch are bell-shaped flowers on stems with leaves. The scene contained within the \u201cframe\u201d includes, from left to right, a dog, a bird clutching a lizard in its claws, a horned head, a head in profile set against an orb, and a seated woman leaning on her left arm.\n\nThe stylized petals at the center bottom derive from designs that appear on pareus (the traditional wraparound fabrics that Tahitians wore). Gauguin used one with similar floral designs for the cover of a portfolio containing copies of his publication Le sourire (The Smile); he pasted the broadsheet\u2019s masthead onto the front (fig. 99.2). At the bottom right of the wood-block print, in a circle created by a stem with leaves resembling those of the Tahitian gardenia (tiare) (Gardenia taitensis) (see fig. 99.3) and the seated woman, Gauguin inserted the initial P. The dog at left is a direct visual quote from Gauguin\u2019s 1899 oil painting Motherhood I (Women by the Sea) (fig. 99.4 [left, W 581]). Gauguin took the bird with the lizard caught in its talons from his 1897 oil painting Vairumati (Her Name Is Vairumati) (fig. 99.5 [left, W 559]). The head of the horned devil derives from a wooden sculpture, two photos of which graced page 30 (verso) of Gauguin\u2019s bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 99.6). Related to the horned head are two traced and transferred monotypes, both titled Tahitian Woman with Evil Spirit (fig. 99.7 [Field 1973 66] and fig. 99.8 [Field 1973 67]). Gauguin took up the motif again in 1902, when he sculpted a portrait in miro wood of Rogatien Joseph Martin, satirizing Hiva Oa\u2019s residing bishop as a devil on account of his allegedly libidinous nature (fig. 99.9).\n\nThe head in profile against an orb can be associated with Tefatu, the Polynesian moon god. The deity appears similarly in Gauguin\u2019s 1893\u201394 wood-block print Te atua (plate 3 from the Noa Noa Suite) (fig. 99.10 left; see cat. 53.3). The two share the circle behind his head\u2014representing the moon\u2014as well as the tiare flowers behind the god\u2019s ear and in his hair (see fig. 99.10). The profile head can be traced back to the 1892 tamanu wood sculptur Hina and Tefatu (fig. 99.10 [right, Gray 97]), but there is another, older source for the various appearances of the head in Gauguin\u2019s woodcarvings, paintings, and graphic works during his second stay in the South Seas. The artist based the motif on visual notations he made, in the late 1880s, in the sketchbook Album Walter after Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s 1840 painting The Shipwreck of Don Juan in the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris (fig. 99.11). The artist included the same head in the background of a woodcarving from around 1898 entitled What Are We? (fig. 99.12 [left, Gray 126]). A closely related male profile appears in his 1902 painting The Escape (fig. 99.13 [left, W 614, as Les amants]). The couple in The Escape are seen again in two traced and transferred monotypes of the same moment, titled Two Marquesans (Two Tahitian Heads) (fig. 99.14 [Field 1973 86]) and Head of a Marquesan (fig. 99.15 [Field 1973 92]). The two reappear, both in profile, in a woodcarving Gauguin made for the exterior of his residence in Atuona (fig. 99.16 [left, Gray 132]).\n\nThe seated woman leaning on her left arm populates a number of Gauguin\u2019s works. This stock figure, slightly modified with each rendition, first appears in his 1891 oil painting Les parau parau (Conversation) (fig. 99.17 [W 435]), followed by the 1894 painting Arearea no varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 99.18 [W 514]). Among its last appearances is in the 1898 oil painting Te pape nave nave (Delectable Waters) (fig. 99.19 [left, W 568]). The paintings\u2019 seated figure in turn served as the source for the motif in various works in a variety of media, among them watercolor monotypes and drawings (see fig. 99.20 [Field 1973 8], fig. 99.21 [Field 1973 9], and fig. 99.22). A drawing intended for the commercial edition of Noa Noa (fig. 99.23) (Noa Noa Interpretive Overview), as well as the aforementioned watercolor monotypes, features the seated figure in the company of a version of Hina, Polynesian goddess of earth.\n\nSeveral of the motifs of Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil were selected by Erick Bohny for inclusion in a poster he designed for an exhibition of Gauguin\u2019s work held in Basel in 1928 (fig. 99.24). It is striking that Bohny chose elements from this modest, late black-and-white wood-block print to convey, using two colors, to potential visitors the rich palette and diversity of subjects found in Gauguin\u2019s art. The exhibition in Basel featured a number of works on paper that were subsequently acquired for the Art Institute\u2019s permanent collection.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">As Gauguin\u2019s work on the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints progressed, he appears to have become more confident with his materials, more rigorous in his carving of the blocks, and more experimental with their printing. The block used for this print is the most irregularly shaped of the group, and the artist echoed its shape in his carving of the interior vignette. While Gauguin lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood he was able to procure, here he successfully combined carving and incising in equal measure to visually integrate them in a single composition. In an impression of this image in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 99.25), he returned to the double printing so prevalent in earlier wood-block prints, among them a number from his Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Nave nave fenua [Delightful Land] [cat. 56.3]).\n\nTo print this impression Gauguin used a second, thicker paper to support the diaphanous sheet during printing. To do so, he first placed the thinner sheet on the inked block and then covered it with the heavier paper for support. The artist then exerted enough pressure to transfer ink to the thin sheet without tearing it. When he lifted both sheets from the block together, the heavier paper acted as a support for the lighter paper. Using this technique Gauguin also prevented the thinner sheet from sticking to the inked block or tearing when he lifted it from the block.\n\nThe wood block was printed in black ink. The National Gallery\u2019s impression was printed on a larger sheet of the ubiquitous thin, translucent Japanese paper. It displays a faint underlying impression of the same block printed in yellow ocher (est.) ink as well, although greatly askew and much higher on the sheet than the impression printed in black ink on top of it (see fig. 99.25).\n\nGauguin selected an extremely fine, lightweight, ivory Japanese paper made with mitsumata (est.) fibers and minimal sizing to print the majority of impressions in the suite. This sheet was posthumously mounted to a secondary support, and all of the edges were sharply trimmed with a blade. In 2015, the secondary support was removed, and the adhesive staining was reduced (see Conservation History).\n\n154 \u00d7 295 mm (image); 192 \u00d7 299 mm (sheet). Note that, as in all of the impressions from the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints, image dimensions vary greatly from sheet to sheet. Among those identified to date here, the impression in Washington, D.C., is the widest, measuring 165 \u00d7 303 mm.\n\nThe vignette-like image is contained within borders on all sides that reflect the irregular contours of the block and reproduce the surface irregularities and cracks that appear along the edges of the block. Where the block was cut at an angle in the upper left, the border of the composition was given a similar contour. Where the contour of the block was more rounded and irregular in the lower right, the border of the vignette followed that contour as well. In addition to aesthetically creating a bordered vignette, the borders provided structural stability, allowing the block to withstand the pressure exerted upon it during printing.\n\nThe integration of carving and incising in a single composition, not seen since Gauguin depleted his stock of end-grain boxwood, is perhaps an indication that, by the time he carved into this block of indigenous wood, he had learned to incorporate his more tonal incising techniques so prevalent in the first group of wood-block prints that he carved for this series (see, for example, cats. 91 and 94) with the more linear gouging that characterizes the second group of woodcuts (see, for example, cats. 96 and 97) in the series. Here, incised lines predominate on the left side of the composition and carved lines formed by subtractive gouging predominate on the right, such that the forms on the right display emphatic linear outlines while on the left, the forms are set against darker tonal backgrounds.\n\nBefore their simultaneous acquisition in 1945 by the Art Institute, this and two other prints, Woman Picking Fruit and Oviri (cat. 85.2) and Te atua (The God) (cat. 103.1), were mounted onto secondary supports. In these instances, the papers were adhered along the top using a thick band of adhesive; dots of the same adhesive were used to adhere the lower left and right corners. The adhesive saturated the thin papers, so that they developed golden-yellow staining in these areas. Curiously, there is also a faint layer of black ink that imparts an impression of fine laid paper (fig. 99.26) onto the rectos of these same prints along the top edges, perhaps a result of the mounting process. Another effect of mounting is the transfer of ink through the thin primary supports and onto the modern secondary supports. It is possible that heat used in the mounting process softened the black ink and facilitated some transfer of it through the fine Japanese paper.\n\nIn 2015, this print was treated to remove it from the secondary support and to reduce the discoloration associated with adhesive and media degradation (fig. 99.27).\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. It has been matted with Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Women, Animals, and Foliage (cat. 97.2), and Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98) to form a frieze (see also Descriptive Analysis and Related Works and fig. 99.1). The impressions were overlapped for visual continuity and Japanese paper hinges were used to secure each to the mount.  \nHarriet K.

Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nThe presence of an underprinting in yellow ocher ink is based on the visual assessment of digital images and was not confirmed with analysis. It is most likely that the yellow color is an intentional, first printing and not the result of staining or deteriorated binder based on its placement on the sheet and the clarity of its edges. The estimation of yellow ocher (an iron oxide) is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Gauguin\u2019s printmaking materials and techniques. The use of iron oxide inks such as ocher were identified by XRF analysis in impressions of Te atua (The God) (cat. 53.4) and Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.3), for example.\n\nFiber analysis was conducted on Tahitian Carrying Bananas (), and [glossary:mitsumata fiber was confirmed. IPS Testing, Appleton, Wisc., report no. IPS 00592-15, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago. Although Tahitian Carrying Bananas was the only print that was sampled and analyzed, visual examination of the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints and various prints for Le sourire (The Smile) revealed that these works were also printed on the same type of paper. The appearance, tone, surface quality, weight, and even fiber distribution found in these papers are identical.\n\nNote that these and one other work by Gauguin (Nave nave fenua [Delightful Land] [cat. 56.2]) were acquired from the Kleeman Galleries in New York. It is interesting to speculate that the appearance of these inked bands may have something to do with the posthumous mounting process carried out by the gallery. I am grateful to Mary Broadway for her thoughtful examination and treatment of the pair. The mounts were retained for future reference.\n\nMary Broadway, condition report, treatment record, and photographic documentation, conservation object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDouglas W.
