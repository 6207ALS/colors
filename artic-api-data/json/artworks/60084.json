    "description": "<p>An amateur archaeologist trained as a painter, Auguste Salzmann learned photography in order to document archaeological finds in the field. He traveled to Jersualem in 1853, photographing holy sites for a year, until he was stricken by fever and forced to return home with some 150 paper negatives. The resulting prints were published in 1856 by the noted printer Louis-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Blanquart-Evrard as a tourist album on the monuments of Jerusalem, available for purchase by the public; in the introduction, Salzmann wrote, &quot;Photographs are not reports, but rather conclusive brute facts.&quot; Despite this assertion, his choice of medium did act as a vehicle of interpretation: the salted paper print gave a somewhat softened, textured appearance to the stone ruins, increasing the suggestion of nostalgia latent in the combination of archeology and tourism.</p>\n",
