    "title": "Double Visions and Disappearing Acts: Six Works by Salvador Dal\u00ed",
    "copy": " The museum acquired a Dal\u00ed painting shortly thereafter, becoming one of the first cultural institutions anywhere in the world to do so. In the nearly 90 years since, the Art Institute\u2019s unparalleled commitment to collecting Dal\u00ed has resulted in holdings of more than three dozen of his creations across mediums. But until now, the museum has never mounted an exhibition solely focused on Dali\u2019s work.   On view through June 12, Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears concentrates on Dal\u00ed\u2019s output from the 1930s, the period in which he invented his signature methods of art making and began showing his work in the United States, finding a very receptive audience. The exhibition\u2014which we developed around a core group of the museum\u2019s holdings from this pivotal moment\u2014brings together a selection of more than 30 paintings, sculptures, drawings, collages, and ephemera by Dal\u00ed, including extremely rare loans from leading public and private Surrealist collections in Europe and the US. These loans were carefully chosen to complement some of the most treasured works by Dal\u00ed in the Art Institute's collection, creating groupings that illuminate the artist\u2019s process and approach during this consequential time in his career. We invite you to look closely at six artworks\u2014arranged in pairs\u2014and discover suggestive images and compositional features that proliferate and, sometimes, disappear.   A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano , 1936 and Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra , 1936   In these two paintings from 1936, Dal\u00ed transforms the arid landscape of the Ampurdan region of Catalonia, where he was born, into a dream-inflected setting. The paintings also share repeating symbols and highly stylized figures that link them closely.   In the Art Institute painting A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano, Dal\u00ed portrays a cluster of figures in the foreground, including a loosely veiled depiction of composer Richard Wagner in profile and a composite rendering of Vladimir Lenin, William Tell, and the artist\u2019s father reclining beside him. In the painting's middle ground, we find a pharmacist (or \u201cchemist\u201d) raising the corner of a melting, sheetlike grand piano. After the work was exhibited at the Art Institute in 1937, Dal\u00ed told a reporter from the Chicago Tribune, \u201cit is impossible to ask for an explanation. I try to get the nearest to a certain thing as seen in a dream . . . . The effect, I think, would be malaise. \u201d   Like the Chemist painting, Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra includes a flaccid grand piano and a figure grasping its same corner. Dal\u00ed recalled having a piano in his childhood home, and he used its form, often deflated, to indicate the weighty burden of middle-class domestic life. The piano motif first appeared in the film An Andalusian Dog, which Dal\u00ed co-wrote and produced in 1929 with Luis Bu\u00f1uel, the instrument being dragged on a rope by characters. It returned, drained of its volume, in Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings of the mid-1930s.   Extending the theme of soft surfaces, Three Young Surrealist Women also includes several elements that reappear in the world of fashion and textiles, media that Dal\u00ed explored during the 1930s, transgressing long-held boundaries and hierarchies between fine and applied arts. The central figure wears a tattered garment that served as a starting point for the \u201cTears\" dress Dal\u00ed later created in collaboration with fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli. Also adorning this strange figure is a floral headpiece, which would go on to inspire Dal\u00ed\u2019s cover design for an edition of American Vogue .   The repetition of imagery across Dal\u00ed\u2019s paintings contributed to the recognizability of his work, transforming their significance as symbols from a personal lexicon to culturally iconic pictures.   Inventions of the Monsters , 1937 and Autumnal Cannibalism , 1936   Painted in the Austrian Alps only months before Germany\u2019s annexation of Austria in the lead-up to World War II, the ominous Inventions of the Monsters reflects the anxious turmoil of escalating conflicts across Europe, a region that was truly inventing its own monsters in the mid-1930s. Among Dal\u00ed\u2019s most intense explorations of doubling and disappearance, the painting depicts hybrid figures littered across an arid landscape\u2014including the double portrait of the artist and his wife, Gala, in the lower-left corner.   When the Art Institute acquired this painting in 1943, Dal\u00ed wrote to the museum with an enigmatic description: Horse women equal maternal river monsters. Flaming giraffe equals masculine apocalyptic monster. Cat angel equals divine heterosexual monster. Hourglass equals metaphysical monster. Gala and Dal\u00ed equal sentimental monster. The little blue dog is not a true monster. Barely visible in the lower-right quadrant of the composition, the dog was rendered with a more transparent application of paint. The resulting impression of a disappearing figure may be a reference to Dal\u00ed\u2019s close friend and famed Andalusian poet Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, who believed that the \u201cAndalusian dog\u201d referenced in the title of Dal\u00ed and Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s film was a veiled epithet aimed at him. Lorca was killed by the Spanish Civil Guard in 1936, shortly before this work was created.   Dal\u00ed connected his frequent use of double images to the then-ongoing civil war within his home country of Spain, often casting the war as an act of cannibalism. Indeed, such an image becomes the central motif of Autumnal Cannibalism, in which an affectionately intertwined couple dines on each other's flesh. Here, Dal\u00ed presents the war as a mutually destructive (albeit amorous) act of consumption. This neutral political position cemented Dal\u00ed\u2019s growing ideological distance from fellow Surrealists who ardently supported the Republican Left.   Mae West\u2019s Face Which May Be Used as a Surrealist Apartment , 1934\u201335 and Apparition of a Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach , 1938   During this tumultuous period of the mid-1930s, Dal\u00ed began constructing his compositions around ambiguous, two-way imagery\u2014pictures that offer multiple and equally valid ways of perceiving what is being depicted. (Think of the famous duck-rabbit optical illusion, which can be found in the lower left-hand corner of Dal\u00ed\u2019s Apparition of a Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach above.) Dal\u00ed increasingly explored the notion of paranoia as a productive way of seeing, generating a proliferation of rational or irrational visions that might be harnessed by the mind. In both of these works, he embraced the motif of a human face that doubled as an illusion of space, suggesting complex interior views and exterior landscapes in its features.   In the iconic collage Mae West\u2019s Face Which May Be Used as a Surrealist Apartment , the artist sourced an image of the actress Mae West from an advertisement for the 1933 film She Done Him Wrong , transforming her face into a domestic setting. The lips sofa depicted here was eventually produced by the designer Jean-Michel Franck in 1938 as part of the \"paranoiac furniture\" Dal\u00ed envisioned for his patron Edward James's London townhouse.   Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach , an extraordinary example of this visually ambiguous approach, centers on an image that oscillates between a classically proportioned human face and a high-pedestaled compotier, or fruit dish. Grounded in Dal\u00ed\u2019s iconography of the edible, this painting is the pinnacle of Dali\u2019s wry and sophisticated commentary on art as a form of consumption: the bowl of pears provocatively beckons viewers to \u201cdigest\u201d the artwork.   As these selections illustrate, Dal\u00ed\u2019s works were closely entwined and interrelated. This quality extends across the artist\u2019s entire body of work, encompassing minute paintings of extreme precision, endeavors into architecture and environmental installation, printed matter, and ephemeral performance\u2014even Dal\u00ed\u2019s cultivated public personality. All provoke us to question what we see. Salvador Dal\u00ed: The Image Disappears threads this observation across an incredibly productive period in the artist\u2019s career, encouraging visitors to explore Dal\u00ed in the details, even as they disappear before our eyes. \u2014Caitlin Haskell, Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator, Modern and Contemporary Art, and director, Ray Johnson Collection and Research; and Jennifer Cohen, curator, provenance and research ",
