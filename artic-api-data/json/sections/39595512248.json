Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as seen in this third\u2014and final\u2014state impression. The group spans the entire Noa Noa Suite, with representative impressions printed with the same combination of materials and techniques from each of the ten blocks. After satisfactorily arriving at final compositions on the blocks, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color using more customary oil-based media, as well as some that contained beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 54.3.2).\n\nRTI captures the work of art lit from multiple angles to enhance the surface topography of the wood-block print (fig. 54.3.3).\n\nThree different layers of media are present in this impression of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created). Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from a piece of glass. The second layer is another oil-based medium; it combines chrome yellow, vermilion, emerald green, and ultramarine blue with significant amounts of zinc white added to it (see fig. 54.3.4 and fig. 54.3.5). Both layers were applied to specific areas directly on the paper by means of transfer from the glass. The layer of oil-based media has a thick, cakey appearance indicative of the wax and resin it contains. Atop this layer of colored media, the block was printed in black printing ink that is a mixture of carbon black and Prussian blue. There was some residual brown ink left on the block, as evidenced by the presence of minimal amounts of umber. Atop the printed image, Gauguin applied two distinct passages of color using stencils. These appear in the emerald-green vegetation in the lower right (fig. 54.3.6) and in the bright-orange dorsal fin of the large fish in the foreground (fig. 54.3.7). The bright orange is a mixture of chrome yellow or chrome orange and vermilion. In both passages, barium sulfate and kaolin were identified, and in one, calcite was also present. These materials were used to add body to the media; as a result, they are quite dimensional and sit atop the surface of the paper.\n\nUnder ultraviolet light the passage of blue in the center of the composition fluoresces bright yellow. The outline of the broad stroke used to apply it is readily visible. The same is true in an area directly to the left in a broad yellow passage that is mostly obscured by the black ink applied over it. The bright-yellow fluorescence is indicative of zinc white, and under high magnification rounded white particles are visible.\n\nA medium-weight, smooth, pale-pink wove paper, now altered to tan, was used to print this impression. The medium-weight paper is a poor-quality, Western, machine-made sheet. The paper fibers are distributed evenly, and the paper is uniform in color. A fine mesh pattern is visible in transmitted light, as are the paper mold characteristics that identify the paper as a machine-made, wove paper of Western origin.\n\nThis sheet of paper is identical to the paper that Gauguin used to print the Art Institute\u2019s first-state impression of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (cat. 54.1), although it has altered completely to tan from its original pink tone, which may have been pale to begin with. Only slight vestiges of pink fibers hinting at the original tone are visible on the verso in the upper left corner (see fig. 54.3.1). Also on the verso, the degree to which applications of solvent have altered the sheet tone are evident (fig. 54.3.8). The paper is very similar to the paper that Gauguin used to print a third-state impression of Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56.2), although this sheet is much heavier in weight and is not glossy on the verso.\n\nObscured by pronounced undulations is a series of fine vertical creases that appear throughout the sheet, which likely formed during the printing of the block, given the directionality of the creases. They are best seen in raking light. In order to effectively print the block, the paper placed on the inked block must be slightly damp. With moisture, the paper expands, and as Gauguin put pressure on this expanded sheet and rubbed it using a left-to-right motion across the horizontal axis, the creases formed in the vertical direction.\n\n203 \u00d7 350 mm (image/sheet)\n\nFour different layers of media are present. In order to fully assess these layers, surface shape studies were undertaken at the Art Institute using RTI methods adapted for use with photometric stereo to reveal textural characteristics that often defy recognition in normal light. Multiple images captured from a fixed camera position, lit from multiple specific angles, were combined to create an interactive composite image that captures the topography of the various media as they sit on the surface of the paper (see fig. 54.3.3). The RTI images confirm that the application of colored media to create tonal and textural variations beneath the black printing ink layer was achieved by transferring media from another source. The even appearance and uniform dispersion of media onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. The first layer of media applied to the paper was chrome yellow. It was applied overall by means of transfer from a tone block used to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper, or another wood block; it is likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. Here, he transferred viscous colored media, solvent-diluted colored media, and stencil-applied media. By placing the glass over the block, Gauguin could accurately position the various media in the areas in which he wanted them to appear. For this impression Gauguin altered his oil-based medium to obtain a semifluid consistency for some areas, while in others he uses the medium in a dry manner. The way it sits on the surface of the paper is a direct result of the degree of solvent dilution, which alters the working properties of a medium. Where discrete islands of transferred media sit on top of the surface of the paper, the medium had a high viscosity, while striations that partially soaked into the paper fibers indicate that it was applied in a more fluid consistency. Solvent dilution of oil-based media is evident in yellow, blue, red, and orange passages and has resulted in a more fluid and even dispersion of this transferred layer of colors. Homogeneous peaks and valleys, rather than islands of media, are evident under magnification. Black printing ink applied over the resulting textured surface rests only on the uppermost, irregular, fluid peaks and results in a reticulated appearance in some areas (fig. 54.3.9). In this impression, the yellow pigment (with some orange present) is dispersed in such a way that irregular islands of media deposited in bands or striations remain partially visible through the black ink layer (fig. 54.3.10). The predominance of islands of yellow pigment found in so many impressions is diminished here. Instead, the even dispersion of the semifluid medium is achieved by adding solvent to dilute it. The severe selective staining of the thin, brittle wove paper is indicative of solvent use. Kerosene and turpentine were commonly used diluents for printing inks, and as exemplified here, are known to selectively darken and oxidize paper supports. The transferred medium most obscured by oxidation in this impression is yellow, and although it appears throughout the composition, its selective application and subsequent darkening of the sheet is clearly visible only in the three waves (fig. 54.3.11), striations, and plant forms in the upper left of the sheet.\n\nTo complete this composition, Gauguin used stencils to establish more emphatic forms in the foreground. The most pronounced example is a stencil-applied orange in the immediate center, and a bright emerald green that is off to the right. Solvent was added to modify the working properties of the media. Under magnification, peaks of media are visible; they were formed as the paper was lifted from the glass during transfer. On the verso, staining from the solvent-diluted media is visible and may be a result of the solubility of some of the oil from the paint and its absorption into the paper (fig. 54.3.12). Once all colored media were transferred, the block, inked in a rich black, was ready for printing. But again, Gauguin was not satisfied with printing what was merely on the block; here he selectively wiped the black ink from passages that he wished to lighten, emphasize, and add surface texture to, as evidenced by the pronounced twill pattern left by his cloth. These areas include the female form to the left (fig. 54.3.13), the textured background, the foreground to the left of the fish and standing figure, his monogram, and between the fishes where he hints at a second female form in the same pose. In the lower right there are five strokes of brush-applied black ink that may have been added over an area from which Gauguin wiped ink, then changed his mind.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication, the print underwent conservation treatment to reduce discoloration. Its tone brightened significantly after treatment, and the colors now appear more vibrant. Comparison with similar passages in pristine impressions from the Noa Noa Suite (see, for example, Auti te pape [Women at the River] [cat. 59.2]), and especially within the pages of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, reveals an intensely bright and colorful palette on papers with ivory to cream hues rather than a golden tone.\n\nThe print is in good condition; however, it is quite brittle as a result of solvent application. The sheet was once perimeter mounted, perhaps onto one of Gauguin\u2019s characteristic presentation mounts. Raking-light examination reveals this quite clearly. Pronounced undulations run in the vertical direction across the sheet. Embossment from the collector\u2019s stamp in the center of the sheet is also visible.  \nHarriet K.

This brings the total number of states to three.\n\nThe locations of eight blocks from the Noa Noa Suite are known. Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and numerous publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nWhen the lightbulb icon is yellow, you can change the direction of light illuminating the work of art. To turn off this function, click on the lightbulb icon. To zoom in or out of the work of art, use the zoom function in the upper right of the image viewer (plus/minus signs). To move the work of art in the viewer window, turn off the lightbulb and click and drag the work of art in the direction you would like it to move. To see the work of art full screen, click on the full-screen icon.

Broadway carried out the most recent conservation treatment, which greatly improved the appearance of the sheet.\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
