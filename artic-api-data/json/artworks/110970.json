    "description": "<p>One of Surrealism\u2019s most important patrons, Edward James was a willing collaborator whose sense of play initiated commissions for his homes from such artists as Ren\u00e9 Magritte and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34123\">Salvador Dal\u00ed</a>, including the latter\u2019s iconic lobster telephone and Mae West lips sofa. James was impressed with Magritte\u2019s work in the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition in London and invited the artist to paint three canvases for his London home. Magritte made <em>On the Threshold of Liberty</em> during his stay there in 1937, reworking the motif of a cannon aimed at a female torso from an earlier horizontal painting of the same title (now in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) into a vertical format in order to meet the specifications of the work\u2019s destined site in James\u2019s ballroom.</p>\n",
