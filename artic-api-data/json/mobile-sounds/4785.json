    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>This section presents a series of new work Kruger produced on the occasion of this exhibition. The artist refers to this body of work as replays, a term that describes her process of animating static works she created in the 1980s and injecting them with contemporary wordplay. Each video plays on its own large LED screen, ranging in size from 11 \u00bd by 11 \u00bd feet to 6 \u00bd by 13 feet. Untitled (I shop therefore I am) and Untitled (Your body is a battleground) begin with a static view of the original images: one shows a hand holding a red placard with white text that reads, \u201cI shop therefore I am,\u201d and the other depicts a bisected portrait of a female face, one half with half-positive exposure and the other with half-negative. The face is overlaid with white type on a red rectangle that reads, \u201cYour body is a battleground.\u201d Over the course of the videos, the images collapse into puzzle pieces and come together again. Once re-formed, the iconic images and texts shift to a new series of phrases reflecting the present moment. Untitled (Our Leader), Untitled (Remember me), and Untitled (Admit nothing/Blame everyone/Be bitter) function in a similar way, in that Kruger disrupts the original images using animation and changing phrases.</p>\n",
