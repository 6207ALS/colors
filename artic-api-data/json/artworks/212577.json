    "description": "<p>The vast scale of Goldberg\u2019s 230-acre River City I plan was designed to support density in the center city and attract new residents with a wide range of highquality urban amenities housed in the project\u2019s vast base plinth. In order to demonstrate the innovation of the project, Goldberg developed a series of dynamic drawings for the base building that illustrate the project\u2019s many features on handmade diagram decals. On the lower industrial level, Goldberg planned parking for 15,000 cars, space for light industrial work, and a new extension of Wacker Drive. His drawing for the central Clark Parkway Level\u2014the heart of the community\u2014shows diagrams of River City residents at the pool, grocery store, hobby shops, and subway station, as well as participating in church services, marching bands, and theater performances. Offering new resources for the city at large as well as the project\u2019s residents, the Pedestrian Park Level crowns the base building with 200 acres of public parks, sports fields, and swimming lagoons.</p>\n",
