    "description": "<p>Among the great treasures in the museum's Deering Family Galleries of Medieval and Renaissance Art, Arms, and Armor are the stunning remains of a noble Valencian family's Renaissance armory.&nbsp;The armory is a testament to the wealth and power of the Spanish Golden Age, and the story of its survival and journey to Chicago in 1927 is filled with obstacles and intrigue. Curator of Applied Arts of Europe Jonathan Tavares highlights the armory's riches and tells the tale of how a steadfast assistant at the Metropolitan Museum and a bold Chicago politician helped make the acquisition possible.&nbsp;<br></p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
