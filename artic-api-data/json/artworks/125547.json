    "description": "<p>Among the most influential figures in Chicago\u2019s Black Arts Movement, <a href=\"http://www.artic.edu/artists/44240/billy-abernathy\">Billy (Fundi) Abernathy</a> is known for creating images that defined Black confidence, elegance, and style. This work extended to his collaborations with his wife, Sylvia (Laini) Abernathy, with whom he designed album covers for Delmark Records in the 1960s. Around that time, the poet and author Amiri Baraka (born LeRoi Jones) encountered Fundi\u2019s photographs of Chicago and proposed a book project that would combine his poetry with Fundi\u2019s images. The resulting collaboration, <em>In Our Terribleness (Some Elements and Meaning in Black Style)</em>, designed by Laini and published in 1970, is both a statement about Black aesthetics and a call to action by the Black Power movement. As Baraka proclaimed, \u201cOur terribleness is our survival as beautiful beings, anywhere.\u201d <em>The Screen</em> and <em>Mother\u2019s Day</em> both appeared in <em>In Our Terribleness</em>. In 1971 the <em>New York Times</em> hailed the book as \u201can example of the new direction that black art is taking.\u201d</p>\n",
