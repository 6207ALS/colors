    "description": "<p>John Singer Sargent was the most sought-after portraitist of his generation on both sides of the Atlantic. Best known for his powerful, vibrant portraits, Sargent nevertheless excelled in a variety of genres, including landscapes, watercolors, and murals. Born in Florence to American parents, he lived abroad, traveling the world in search of his subjects and working professionally for more than 50 years.</p><p>Sargent first exhibited at the Art Institute\u2014at the time located at Michigan Avenue and Van Buren Street\u2014in 1890, drawing crowds of visitors to the museum and helping to put Chicago on the map as a recognized center for contemporary art and culture. His ability to straddle the line between tradition and the avant-garde continued to impress audiences and collectors at the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Sargent\u2019s work was regularly featured in the galleries of the Art Institute as well as other venues and homes in the city. Foundational collectors in Chicago, including Charles Deering, Martin A. Ryerson, and Annie Swan Coburn, helped to secure Sargent\u2019s presence, and eventual legacy, in the city.<br></p><p><a href=\"/exhibitions/2522/\">A 2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute examined Sargent\u2019s impressive breadth of artistic accomplishment and the many connections between the artist, his patrons, his creative circle, and the city of Chicago.</p>",
