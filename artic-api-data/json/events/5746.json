    "description": "<p>Join exhibition co-curators Caitlin Haskell and Tere Arcq as they discuss the making of <a href=\"/exhibitions/9935/remedios-varo-science-fictions\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Remedios Varo: Science Fictions</em></a>, the first US museum exhibition in over 20 years dedicated to the Spanish-born, Mexico-based Surrealist. </p><p>Bringing together more than 60 of Varo's paintings, drawings, and sketchbooks from 1955 until her death in 1963, this show considers the artist's practice of combining science, alchemy, magic, and mysticism with Surrealist automatic techniques.</p><h2>About the Speakers</h2><p><strong>Caitlin Haskell</strong> is the Gary C. and Frances Comer Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Art Institute of Chicago, where she has overseen the collection of modern art since 2018.
