The siege began after a raid by ATF agents on February 28, 1993, in which four agents and six Davidians were killed. The agency conducted the raid in the belief that the sect\u2019s leader, David Koresh, was keeping a large arsenal of illegal weapons. \n\nThe FBI, citing the abuse of children in the compound, received permission from Attorney General Janet Reno to end the siege by tear-gassing the buildings. Within minutes of this attack, the compound was ablaze. It has never been determined whether the fire was a result of the assault or was set by the Branch Davidians themselves. Koresh, a self-proclaimed messiah, and eighty of his followers died in the fire.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape in Memoriam",
