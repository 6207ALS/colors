    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator Jonathan Tavares.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Tavares: This all steel wheellock pistol which is incredibly rare, it's one of only maybe only a handful, 12 or so surviving wheellock pistols that were produced in Ripoll, in Catalonia and Spain. The pistol itself is a wheellock pistol which means that it is ignited by a wheel that spins. The way you would load this pistol is you put the charge down the barrel, and then you have to use a key, sort of like a chuck key, called a spanner to wind the wheel one whole rotation, and then a little pin goes into the wheel and stops it. Then you manually have to pull the jaws down into the pan area over the wheel, and in the jaws would have been an iron pyrites. When you pull the trigger a serrated wheel spins and turns against the iron pyrites, causing sparks. The sparks ignite the powder in the pan, exploding the bullet. All that happens in a split second. It's an intricate mechanism that works like clockwork, and every last piece has to be perfectly made, every spring, every screw thread, it's really a master work of a major craftsman.</p>\n",
