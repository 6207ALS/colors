    "transcript": "<p>Claude Monet painted this work, titled Branch of the Seine near Giverny (Mist), in 1897. Monet was French and lived from 1840 to 1926. The work is oil on canvas and measures approximately 3 feet high by 3 feet wide. It is part of a series, Mornings on the Seine, which includes more than twenty canvases produced in the summers of 1896 and 1897. They depict the spot near Monet\u2019s home in Giverny, France, where the Epte River flows into the Seine River.</p>\n<p><em>Quiet sounds of the river running and birds chirping</em></p>\n<p>A willow, swathed in early-morning mist, is reflected in the surface of a body of water, which we know from this work\u2019s title to be the River Seine. The left half of the canvas is dominated by the hazy silhouette of the willow and its image in the river\u2019s surface. The right half is even less distinct, comprised of icy blue shapes that look like clouds but likely represent other trees and bushes (and their reflections) in the distance. (Their basic outlines match those of the foliage in the background of other paintings from this series.) The scene appears monochromatic at first, rendered in shades of blue from white (the morning sky glimpsed beyond the trees) to almost black (the shadowy depths of the willow\u2019s branches). Closer inspection reveals hues of green and lavender along with blue.</p>\n<p>Nothing in the painting is clearly outlined, and it is as if we are looking at the scene through foggy glasses. (Imagine you are listening to this audio with earplugs in; that muffled version would be similar to the visual effect here.) There is no defined horizon line, nor is there any line distinguishing the \u201creal\u201d things in the painting from their reflections. Instead, the horizontal line that divides the mirror-like surface of the water from the land and sky is implied through the near perfect symmetry between the top and bottom halves of the canvas. If the painting were cut in two horizontally, the two halves would nearly match. If the painting were turned upside down, it would still appear to depict some trees and sky above reflective water. This effect is called a reversible image: any distinction between the reflection and what it reflects is indiscernible. The effect is magnified by Monet\u2019s choice of a nearly square canvas, which was unusual for landscape painting.</p>\n<p>Throughout the composition the paint texture is smooth and flat, the result of blending the paint across the canvas, obscuring individual brushstrokes. With this technique Monet rendered the invisible haze through which we view the scene: by blending wet paint into wet paint he achieved subtle transitions between color areas while blurring the distinctions between compositional elements. Monet worked over the surface of the painting as a whole, moving back and forth between the foreground and the background to build up the canvas at varying stages of dryness, including areas of wet-into-wet blending and wet-over-dry application. In addition, some areas have the appearance of having been wiped or rubbed while the paint was still soft, resulting in a more matte, flat surface with paint from the underlying layers exposed.</p>\n<p>Although the specific setting of the scene is difficult to discern, the painting likely depicts the bank of the Seine on the left and that of the \u00cele aux Orties, one of the many islets dotting the river at that time, on the right. Monet might have worked on land or on his floating studio, a boat built for the purpose of painting his many scenes of the Seine.</p>\n<p>Have you ever woken up so early in the morning\u2014before the sun starts to peak its head over the horizon\u2014that the whole world seems still, asleep beneath a blanket of dewy mist?</p>\n",
