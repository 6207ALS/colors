This impression was printed on the verso of a fragment of an impression of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55) that was printed by the artist in collaboration with his friend, the artist Louis Roy, for a commercial edition of the Noa Noa Suite that was never realized. It was not the first time that Gauguin reused a \u201cRoy\u201d impression. He did so in 1894\u201395 when he used versos of failed impressions of Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57.2) to print impressions of Oviri (cat. 84) and several other works at that time.\n\nHere Gauguin used a small piece of coarsely grained wood, in contrast to the fine-grained boxwood used for Three People, a Mask, a Fox, and a Bird (cat. 111) and Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). As in theSuite of Late Wood-Block Prints (91\u2013105), this piece of wood likely derived from an indigenous source that the artist prepared for carving and printing himself. The block is extant, in the collection of the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague (fig. 115.2).\n\nThis impression was printed twice, in black ink directly on top of black ink offset that had resulted from the initial printing of Maruru on the verso. The first impression is faint; the second impression is darker, askew and purposely misaligned. This creates a visual resonance that Gauguin often embraced.\n\nThe paper is a sturdy, smooth, hard-sized Western wove paper that Roy and Gauguin favored for printing their commercial edition.\n\n103 \u00d7 149 mm (image); 108 \u00d7 154 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print was examined in anticipation of exhibition in 2003. No treatment was undertaken.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
