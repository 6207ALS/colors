Cup fragment fabricated by the mosaic glass technique, tooled, and polished. The fragment preserves a small segment of the outsplayed rim and double carinated profile. In an olive-green matrix is a mosaic pattern formed from sections of a single cane in a brown-to-amethyst ground, a central olive-green dot with a concentric red ring surrounded by a ring of nine white dots.\n\nSmall segment of rim is preserved, three sides are broken. The edges and back are covered with a thick brown weathering crust and some silver iridescence. The interior has been repolished but still retains some deep pitting and iridescence.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 85 Fragment of a Cup, late 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.\n\n</section>",
