    "description": "<p>During the last decade of his life, John Henry Twachtman frequently painted views of the landscape surrounding his home on Round Hill Road in Greenwich, Connecticut. In a departure from typically barren images of winter, he enjoyed depicting the beauty of the frozen terrain, believing that it was conducive to contemplation and regeneration. The dense, gradually built-up layers of paint in <em>Icebound</em> mimic the accumulation of snow on frozen ground, and the sinuous curves that define the snow and ice against the water suggest movement in an otherwise tranquil environment. Almost square in format, the painting\u2019s harmonious composition exemplifies Twachtman\u2019s opinion that \u201cnever is nature more lovely than when it is snowing.\u201d</p>\n",
