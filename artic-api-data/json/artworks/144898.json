    "description": "<p>Dechen Gyalmo (Queen of Bliss) is a female Buddha more specifically known as a <em>vajrayogini,</em> or a female yogi, who has attained enlightenment through the practice of yoga and by following the tantric (Vajrayana) Buddhist path.  Her aspect is somewhat horrific, as she has three eyes, raised eyebrows and bares her teeth.  She is naked except for a bone apron strung from her waist and swaying ornaments on her upper body, denoting her energized state.  Her attributes include a double-headed drum <em>(damaru)</em> with ribbons attached in her raised right hand, while she holds a chopper <em>(karttrika)</em> in her left. Her wrathful quality is a sign of her yogic attainment.  She has conquered armies of demons, and illusions <em>(mara)</em> and the inner evils of hatred, anger, greed and selfishness. She is most often represented in painting, but rarely seen in sculptural form.</p>\n",
