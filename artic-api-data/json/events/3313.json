    "description": "<p>Arto Lindsay has stood at the intersection of music and art for more than four decades. As a member of the 1970s New York band DNA, he contributed to the foundation of No Wave. As bandleader for the Ambitious Lovers he developed an intensely subversive pop music, a hybrid of American and Brazilian styles. Throughout his career, Lindsay has collaborated with both visual and musical artists, including Vito Acconci, Laurie Anderson, Animal Collective, Matthew Barney, Caetano Veloso and Rirkrit Tiravanija. After having been involved with Carnival in Brazil for many years in 2004 he began making his own parades as large-scale interactive art happenings.</p><p>For this intimate performance in the Art Institute\u2019s Fullerton Hall, Lindsay performs music from his recent album Cuidado Madame.  His first full-length album of new material since 2004, Cuidado Madame originated with recordings of atabaques (Afro-Brazilian hand drums) in Brazil, and combines Lindsay's signature abstract guitar sound with Tropic\u00e1lia-inspired balladry. </p><p>The concert features Lindsay in performance with Melvin Gibbs (Rollins Band), Paul Wilson (KOOL &amp; KAAS), Kassa Overall, Patrick Higgins (Zs) and Ryu Takahashi.</p><p>Beauty Pill, a DC-based semi-electronic band lead by producer, singer, songwriter, and guitarist Chad Clark, opens the concert. The band includes Basla Andolsun, Jean Cool, Drew Doucette and Devin Ocampo. The densely constructed and deeply felt music of their latest LP, Beauty Pill Describes <em>Things As They Are</em>, were recorded as part of an art installation titled <em>Immersive Ideal.</em> For this project, viewers were invited to watch the band through a pane of glass as they went about recording the album in a specially constructed studio. An exercise in radical transparency, the band learned, arranged and recorded one song per day with no practice beforehand. </p><p><strong>Presented with Constellation and the Evening Associates of the Art Institute of Chicago</strong></p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p><p><em>Support for Live Arts programming is provided by the Woman\u2019s Board of the Art Institute of Chicago.</em></p>",
