Following the concert, Jesse Rosenberg, Northwestern University associate professor of musicology, and museum educator Paulina Lopez discuss German expressionism in art and music.</p><p><strong>About the Artist</strong></p><p><strong>Spektral Quartet</strong> actively creates vivid conversations between exhilarating works of the traditional canon and those written this decade, this year, or this week. Spektral is known for creating seamless connections across centuries and drawing in the listener with charismatic deliveries, interactive concert formats, an up-close atmosphere, and bold, inquisitive programming. In a review of a recent show, the <em>New York Times</em> wrote that \u201cthey have everything: a supreme technical command that seems to come easily; a capacity to make complicated music clear; and, most notably . . . an ability to cast a magic spell.\"</p><p>Nominated for a Grammy award and named \u201cChicagoans of the Year\u201d by the <em>Chicago Tribune </em>in 2017, Spektral Quartet appears on the Sono Luminus, Azica Records, Nimbus Records, and Parlour Tapes+ labels, and is set to release a new album with saxophonist and MacArthur fellow Miguel Zen\u00f3n in the summer of 2018. Recent residencies include Stanford University, New World Symphony, and Northwestern University, and the quartet is proud to serve as ensemble-in-residence for the University of Chicago\u2019s Department of Music. Dubbed \u201cThe city\u2019s hottest string quartet\u201d by the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, Spektral Quartet is committed to championing the work of Chicago composers around the world and reaching new audiences within the city limits through its partnership with Theaster Gates\u2019s Rebuild Foundation.</p><p><em>*Doors for the concert open at 1:30 and do not require museum admission.</em></p>",
