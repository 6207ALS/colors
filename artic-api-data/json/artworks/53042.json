    "description": "<p>A wealthy New York artist known as one of the \u201cPark Avenue Cubists,\u201d Charles Green Shaw painted <em>Wrigley\u2019s</em> as an advertising pitch to the company, combining abstraction with commercial art. He placed a package of spearmint gum against a series of rectangular forms that resembles the lower Manhattan skyline. Shaw echoed and contrasted the blocky, static shapes of the vertical skyscrapers with the levitating, rotating rectangle of the featured product. Although the advertising firm declined to produce this design, the witty juxtapositions of Shaw\u2019s composition align Wrigley\u2019s gum with the streamlined, modern skyscrapers and the pulse of urban life.</p>\n",
