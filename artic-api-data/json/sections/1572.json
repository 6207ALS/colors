In addition to this work, Matisse fixed his likeness in at least two paintings, twelve drawings (see fig. 2.1, fig. 2.2, fig. 2.3, fig. 2.4, and fig. 2.5), and four prints (see fig. 2.6). Here, the artist\u2019s most available subject is turned slightly. The subtle variations of light across his features are registered by the absence or presence of ink marks. While such treatment might suggest a particular mood or mental state, Matisse\u2019s interest was less in \u201cpsychological interpretation\u201d than in investigation of the plastic quality of a face and its \u201cindividual and profound expression.\u201d As he explained in 1954, \u201cthe driving force that leads me throughout the execution of a portrait depends on the initial shock of contemplating a face.\u201d The contrasting play of spare, fine lines and dense, broad marks used to render the eyes in the Art Institute\u2019s drawing reveals its foundation: his own focus shifting from one eye to the other and from the mirror to the sheet as he worked to capture his image on paper.\n\nThe work is part of a small group of known early pen-and-ink portraits that share the same sheet dimensions. These drawings were constructed from a network of energetic marks, hatchings, and crosshatchings set down in thin overlapping layers; out of the staccato-like strokes emerge facial features that are defined less by contours than by a condensation of marks that art critic Pierre Courthion described as \u201ca swarm of bees buzzing around a form.\u201d The mix of thin and thick and short and long lines moving in different directions, specific to the part of the face they describe, recalls the drawings of Vincent van Gogh, whose 1901 retrospective Matisse visited at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune in Paris and whose drawing titled Haystacks he owned by the time he made this self-portrait.\n\nWhile the pen lines are firmly placed on the sheet, the Art Institute\u2019s work is the most loosely drawn of the group, with far fewer background marks and more space between the individual lines. As a result, unlike the other sheets in which Matisse\u2019s visage emerges from a thicket of inky marks with a flickering \u201cvibrato\u201d of light, here, his form is set against the bare sheet and seems to come into view by overcoming a dazzling light source. Such interest in using line to produce both light and shadow likely comes from a number of sources, including Matisse\u2019s early study of Rembrandt van Rijn. The impact of his work on the artist was long-lasting: decades later, while discussing his drawings with the writer Henry de Montherlant, Matisse explained, \u201cI do not renounce the play or values, or modulations. I modulate with variations in the thickness of my line, and above all with the areas it delimits on the white paper. I modify the different parts of the white paper without touching them, but by how they relate to neighboring areas. This can be very well seen in the drawings of Rembrandt.\u201d As if acknowledging his debt to the older artist, Matisse presents himself in the Art Institute\u2019s work wearing a floppy artist\u2019s cap much like one the seventeenth-century Dutch master wore in his own self-portraits.  \nStephanie D\u2019Alessandro\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse drew this self-portrait using both reed and metal-nibbed dip pens with black ink over preliminary marks drawn in black crayon. He first positioned the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and sides of the face with faint black crayon (see fig. 2.7). Then he built up the image with overlapping and interweaving short pen strokes. The artist selected a fine metal nib to produce the thinnest lines, such as the vertical strokes used to shade the eyes (see fig. 2.7) and the slenderest marks within the beard and neck. Several pen strokes in the neck show the parallel tracks left by the split metal nib when the ink ran dry (see fig. 2.8). He used a pen with a slightly wider nib to layer medium-width lines, for example, those running vertically through the cap (see fig. 2.9). Matisse chose a reed pen with a broad, square-cut nib for the dense, dark, blunt marks that punctuate the composition throughout (see fig. 2.10). He drew on tan wove paper from a tablet (as indicated by the slightly rounded corners).\n\nPinholes at both upper corners and in the center near the top edge indicate that Matisse either pinned the paper to a board while drawing or pinned up the finished work.\n\nThe artist\u2019s use of reed pens had a precedent in the reed-pen drawings of Vincent van Gogh. At the time of this self-portrait\u2019s creation, Matisse owned one such work, Haystacks (1888; fig. 2.11), in which Van Gogh layered reed-pen marks over thinner, more sinuous quill-pen lines in a manner analogous to Matisse\u2019s combining of reed and metal-nibbed pens in this work.\n\nMatisse is known to have drawn with reeds he collected himself in the South of France, cutting pens from the dry, hollow shafts. Due to the width and fibrous nature of the reed wall, reeds are best suited for wide points and blunt, square-cut nibs. Reed pens produce only short strokes, as they have no channel or reservoir to hold a quantity of ink. Under magnification 80\u00d7 the deposition of ink along the lines appears slightly broken or jagged, a result of the stiff reed skipping across the slight grain of the paper (see fig. 2.10).\n\nInscribed and signed: \u00e0 Bruce / Henri Matisse (lower right, in graphite) (fig. 2.12).\n\nMatisse drew using a reed and metal-nibbed dip pens and black ink over preliminary marks in black crayon. The ink has a glossy sheen visible when the surface is viewed at an angle. The crayon lines lack the dense, waxy character of most crayon marks due to their light application. However, the medium can be identified under magnification 150\u00d7 by the translucent appearance of the black clumps clinging to the paper fibers, which is indicative of a clear wax binder.\n\nThe primary support is thin, smooth, tan wove paper. The edges are straight cut with rounded corners. Under magnification 80\u00d7 the right edge appears slightly uneven, as if torn from a block of paper. Both of these features suggest that the sheet came from a tablet. Intact corners at the top left and bottom right indicate that it retains its original dimensions. The fibers are uniform in color with very few inclusions.\n\nThe secondary and tertiary supports are not original. The drawing is laid down overall to off-white wove card that is taped along the perimeter to another piece of off-white wove card.\n\nPrimary support: 30.8 \u00d7 19.5 cm (12 1/8 \u00d7 7 5/8 in.); secondary support: 34.5 \u00d7 22.7 cm (13 9/16 \u00d7 9 in.); tertiary support: 47 \u00d7 34.5 cm (18.5 \u00d7 13.5 in.).\n\nThe work has not undergone conservation treatment since entering the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection. Examination reveals that the drawing was treated in the past to address various issues, including creases, edge tears, and minor losses to the paper. At magnification 150\u00d7 the ink displays minute cracks and losses from flaking in what were the densest ink passages. The ink flakes were consolidated in the past and are currently secure. At some point, likely in the late twentieth century, the drawing was laid down overall to a piece of card in order to stabilize the damaged sheet. That card was in turn taped along the perimeter to another, heavier piece of card. The conservation file contains a condition report dated November 16, 1994; the condition appears unchanged since that time.\n\nClose inspection reveals old folds, creases, tears, and minor losses, which have been repaired.  \nKristi Dahm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Given by Henri Matisse to Patrick Henry Bruce (Mar. 25, 1881\u2013Nov. 12, 1936), Paris and New York, by c. 1908\u201309\u2013by Nov. 12, 1936.\n\nBy descent to his wife, Helen Bruce (n\u00e9e Helen Frances Kibbey, June 14, 1880\u2013Aug. 1, 1962), New York and Los Angeles, by Nov. 12, 1936\u20131946.\n\nSold to Vincent Price (May 27, 1911\u2013Oct. 25, 1993), Los Angeles, 1946\u2013Oct. 25, 1993.\n\nBy descent to the Vincent Price Estate, Oct. 25, 1993\u2013spring 1994.\n\nSold to an unidentified Swiss dealer by Victoria Price (born Apr. 27, 1962), on behalf of the Vincent Price Estate, spring 1994.\n\nGalerie Hopkins-Thomas, Paris, by Apr. 21, 1995.\n\nSold to Dr. Martin L.

Matisse translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 221.\n\nPierre Courthion, as quoted in Raymond Escholier, Matisse, ce vivant (Fayard, 1956), p. 140.\n\nFor more on the Van Gogh retrospective, see Walter Feilchenfeldt, Vincent van Gogh: The Years in France; Complete Paintings 1886\u20131890; Dealers, Collectors, Exhibitions, Provenance (Philip Wilson, 2013), p. 22. Matisse received the Van Gogh drawing as a gift from the artist John Russell around 1888; Hilary Spurling has recorded the details of this transaction in Spurling, The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse; The Early Years, 1869\u20131908 (Knopf, 1998), pp. 138, 442 n. 43.\n\nMatisse\u2019s use of the term \u201cvibrato\u201d comes from his discussion of Divisionism; see E.

Watrous does not specify when the two artists began this practice. Pierre Matisse reported that they may have been influenced by the letters of Vincent van Gogh, in which he praised the reeds of southern France as drawing implements; see Watrous, Craft of Old-Master Drawings, p. 56n18. Yet very few of Van Gogh\u2019s letters were published prior to 1914, so their influence on the choice of reed pens for this drawing is unclear.

In a letter to his sister (dated May 28, 1933), Bruce mentions a Matisse drawing that he had given to Helen and that she was sending back to him. It is unclear whether he was referring to the self-portrait and whether he ever received the drawing from Helen.
