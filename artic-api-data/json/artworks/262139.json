It contains fifty sketchbooks; poems and personal correspondence; scrapbooks of announcements and articles; photographs and glass negatives of the Albright family and of the artwork made by Ivan Albright, his twin brother Malvin, and their father Adam Emory Albright; diagrams and sketches for his paintings; ephemera such as his color wands; and research papers of Michael Croydon, Albright\u2019s friend and biographer, relating to Albright and his 1978 book Ivan Albright. Parts of this collection were published in the catalogue for the 1997 exhibition Ivan Albright, held at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Albright,%20Ivan,%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Albright,%20Ivan,%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
