    "transcript": "<p>MARTHA WOLFF: This is a wonderful example of Sir Joshua Reynolds Grand Portrait style, and his career was mostly devoted to the painting of portraits for aristocratic sitters.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: At this period, history paintings, or scenes drawn from classical mythology, the Bible or history, were considered the noblest form of art.  Reynolds, who had studied art and antiquity in Italy, fused history painting with portraiture in his flattering portrayals of the English aristocracy, filled with classical allusions.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: These classical references are reflected both in the subject, which shows a fashionable beauty sacrificing to the Three Graces, and by implication, she is their associate or perhaps even the Fourth Grace.  It's also reflected in the vaguely classical quality of her loose drapery, which is not really contemporary dress at all, but a sort of antique costume that he's put her into.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Reynolds's scholarly approach to portraiture brought him great professional success, and he was appointed founding president of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1768.  This painting, first exhibited in London in 1765, no doubt helped burnish his growing reputation.  It depicts Lady Sarah Bunbury, who had attracted the admiration of the future King George III a few years earlier.  So a portrait of this celebrated beauty, shone as a goddess-like figure receiving a wreath from her fellow graces, would surely have drawn a good deal of attention among Reynolds's fashionable society clientele.</p>\n",
