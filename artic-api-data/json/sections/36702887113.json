This cycle of works was part of the artist\u2019s revived interest in painting the English Channel between the early and mid-1880s. Monet was certainly no stranger to the coast, as exemplified by his 1867 painting The Beach at Sainte-Adresse (fig. 19.2 [cat. 13] [W92]). But for much of the 1870s, he had been preoccupied with painting the sites and activities of the urban and suburban Parisian landscape in works such as The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil (fig. 19.3 [cat. 15] [W284]) and Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare (fig. 19.4 [cat. 16] [W441]). With his move to V\u00e9theuil (about forty miles northwest of Paris) in 1878 and the death of his wife, Camille, in 1879, however, Monet shifted focus. He retreated from his depictions of the city and suburbs and began painting the terrain around V\u00e9theuil, as well as a few still lifes\u2014including the Art Institute\u2019s Apples and Grapes (fig. 19.5 [cat. 17] [W546])\u2014and numerous scenes of Normandy\u2019s cliff-filled coastal sites and shorelines, especially at F\u00e9camp, Dieppe, Pourville, Varengeville, and \u00c9tretat.\n\nDeparting from his home base in Poissy\u2014where he had recently relocated with Alice Hosched\u00e9 (the wife of his former patron Ernest Hosched\u00e9, whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband\u2019s death) and their families\u2014Monet visited the coast twice in 1882, from early February to mid-April and from mid-June to early October. Because most of the paintings from these trips feature similar subjects and titles, it is often difficult to definitively identify which canvases were produced during each trip. The bright summer sky and the inclusion of two female figures\u2014often thought to be Alice and one of her daughters, or perhaps her two eldest daughters, Marthe and Blanche\u2014suggest that Monet executed Cliff Walk during his second trip, when he brought Alice and their combined family with him.\n\nIn the paintings he created in the early 1880s in Normandy, Monet experimented with unique viewpoints (from both the top and the base of the cliffs) and the placement of the horizon line, creating compositions that challenged the conventional spatial construction of nineteenth-century French landscape paintings. Composed of three main zones\u2014sky, water, and land\u2014Cliff Walk has a certain flatness to it, but Monet achieved dynamism through his flickering brushwork, as well as the skewed diagonal created by the landmass at the bottom left and the two jutting lobes of land at the center and right. He provided limited suggestions of three-dimensionality by placing patches of dark shadows next to the bright, colorful cliff tops, recalling the way Japanese printmakers juxtaposed contrasting colors to indicate spatial recession.\n\nIt is well known that Monet was influenced by Japanese prints\u2014he started his own collection of them in the 1850s or 1860s. Many elements of Cliff Walk\u2014the juxtaposition of flat planes of contrasting color, the bird\u2019s-eye point of view, the cropping of compositional elements along the edge of the picture frame, the sinuous winding edge of the cliff, and the inclusion of figures and boats to infuse a sense of scale and balance\u2014bring to mind the woodblock prints of Katsushika Hokusai and Utagawa Hiroshige that were in his collection (see fig. 19.6) and were increasingly visible (and available) in Paris from the 1860s. Monet\u2019s figure types in the painting also imply the influence of Japanese prints. In constructing his two female subjects, the artist suggested that the women are stylishly dressed, though they do not conform to the meticulous, fashion plate\u2013inspired genre paintings of contemporaries like James Tissot or Alfred Stevens. Monet made his figures\u2019 garments relatively illegible, recalling female figures\u2014often encased in fabric and holding umbrellas\u2014from Japanese prints.\n\nThe inclusion of the two figures in Cliff Walk at Pourville has resulted in significant art historical debate. In his treatment of Monet\u2019s paintings depicting the coast of Normandy, Robert L. Herbert notes that only four of the land- and seascapes from this productive year show tourists, and further, that all four feature two women looking out over the water. In relation to this, Herbert assessed: \u201cFor Monet as for so many middle-class men, women at leisure characterized summertime generally and seashore vacations in particular. Here the two figures, small but conspicuous by their color and position, are intermediaries between ourselves and the scene; aware of these bourgeois women, we cannot picture ourselves alone. They help form a vacation picture in which all signs of work and city are absent; the two women and we look upon pleasure boating from an outlook marked only by exuberant growth and bright sunshine.\u201d\n\nInstead of a depiction of the tourist experience, Richard Thomson has argued that Monet highlighted the natural grandeur and power of land, sea, and sky, thereby producing a \u201cmodern sublime.\u201d In Cliff Walk, \u201cthe vulnerability of the tiny bourgeoises on the grimly shadowed crag plays up the sublime, and vicariously prompts our own reaction to that experience of being close to the edge.\u201d Indeed, the way in which Monet integrated the two figures into the environment suggests that nature has swallowed them up. Unlike the Art Institute\u2019s Beach at Sainte-Adresse (cat. 13), in which Monet clearly included the fishermen and tourist couple as a late addition, here he embedded the figures into the landscape, building them up at the same time as the other areas of the composition and incorporating them into the swirly vegetation on the cliff. It is difficult to tell where strokes of grass end and the fabric of the figures\u2019 garments begins (fig. 19.7). However, it is impossible to ignore the fact that Monet did not depict nature as a fierce, dangerous opponent; sailboats leisurely float on the relatively calm water, and puffy white clouds fill the beautiful blue summer sky. The inclusion of the words promenade (\u201cwalk\u201d) and falaise (\u201ccliff\u201d) in the painting\u2019s title from early in its history heightens this ambiguity; the title at once evokes the natural landscape and the idea that it is something to be trod upon by civilization.\n\nDuring his 1882 trips, Monet typically painted two to five variations on a single motif. It is clear that he was already thinking of his coastal paintings of 1882 serially, an approach that he would fully realize in the three series that he executed between February 1896 and April 1897 and exhibited under the group title Falaises (Cliffs). Writing to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, on March 25, 1882, Monet exclaimed that he did not wish to send the dealer a shipment of new canvases from Pourville until he could see the \u201cseries\u201d all together.\n\nAs Virginia Spate has observed, Monet at this time particularly seems to have been experimenting with \u201c\u2018pairs\u2019 of landscapes with and without figures as if speculating on the difference made by the presence or absence of spectator figures.\u201d Cliff Walk at Pourville and the related composition Edge of the Cliff at Pourville (fig. 19.8 [W757]) are suggestive of this. The paintings clearly depict the same site\u2014distinguished by the two unusual rocky outcroppings at center and right. There are slight variations in Monet\u2019s points of view\u2014in the Art Institute\u2019s painting, he seems to have pivoted a bit to his left, as evidenced by the more extreme cropping of the cliff at right and the greater expanse of the cliff top at bottom left. The major difference, however, is the inclusion of the figures in the Art Institute\u2019s painting.\n\nIt is difficult\u2014and perhaps unproductive\u2014to assume the order in which Monet constructed this pair of paintings. Edge of the Cliff is slightly smaller\u2014painted on a rotated no. 20 portrait (figure) canvas as opposed to a no. 25 portrait (figure). One wonders if the artist began with the smaller picture and worked his way up to the larger canvas to perhaps accentuate the horizontality or the legibility of the subject. Or was the smaller picture painted after the women had already walked along the edge of the cliff? Indeed, in Edge of the Cliff, one gets the haunting sense that there is an already trodden path composed of pinkish tones that follow the inverted S curve of the cliff line. A similar pairing can be seen in two other paintings executed during this summer, Edge of the Cliffs at Pourville (1882; private collection [W751]) and On the Cliff at Pourville (fig. 19.9 [W752]). Notably, Monet chose the former, the larger and more fully developed of this pair\u2014also the one that included signs of human presence\u2014to exhibit with Cliff Walk in the solo exhibition of his work at Durand-Ruel, Paris, in 1883.\n\nMonet\u2019s omission and addition of specific elements in these paintings and his thoughtful selection of which paintings to include for exhibition suggest that he was meticulously crafting his land- and seascapes of the English Channel. Many scholars agree that Monet did not paint them quickly and spontaneously in one outdoor sitting. Instead, he labored over them, creating carefully arranged compositions. The artist himself acknowledged this; in a letter to Alice while on his first trip in 1882, he wrote that \u201cmost of my studies have had ten or twelve sessions, and several of them, twenty.\u201d\n\nRecent technical examinations concur that Monet executed Cliff Walk at Pourville in multiple sessions. Transmitted-infrared imaging reveals that he originally started the painting as a significantly different composition. In an early stage, he laid in the horizon line almost four inches higher than the one that appears in the final composition (fig. 19.10). It is difficult to determine if this early horizon line\u2014clearly visible at the left edge of the canvas\u2014continues all the way to the right edge. One thing is certain, however: the legible section of this early horizon is not straight and precisely horizontal like that which separates sky and water in the final compositions of Cliff Walk and many other paintings from 1882. Rather, it ascends slightly from the left edge of the canvas toward the center.\n\nBecause it is difficult to determine the features of the early composition on the right-hand side and in the lower three-quarters of the canvas, it is challenging to imagine what viewpoint Monet was initially trying to capture. If he was on a cliff top, perhaps he first intended the composition to be similar to The Cliff at Varengeville, in which the distant cliffs ascend from the sea (fig. 19.11 [W806]). Indeed, there appear to be curved lines in the top-right half of Cliff Walk that may be indicative of the undulating cliff line dominating the right side of that painting. Or perhaps Monet was standing on the beach at the base of the cliff face, as in the two paintings from the same summer entitled The Church at Varengeville, Morning Effect (fig. 19.12 [W795] and fig. 19.13 [W794]). A composition like this might explain Monet\u2019s inclusion of the higher, craggy horizon line and the active brushstrokes in the top half of the painting, which are also visible in the X-ray (fig. 19.14). Even more curious is that the canvas on which Cliff Walk was painted has a weave match with the aforementioned Apples and Grapes in the Art Institute\u2019s collection; this suggests that the two now-discrete canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. Was this an unused canvas sitting around for some time in Monet\u2019s studio or in the Paris shop of the color merchant H. Vieille &amp; E. Troisgros? Either scenario could be feasible, for the canvas stamp found on the verso of Cliff Walk dates to between 1879 and 1883.\n\nMonet also made changes to the final composition (see Technical Report). When he first laid in the present horizon line, he extended it farther to the right edge of the canvas (fig. 19.15). The sunlit portion of the cliff at right was added early on, before the sky was fully in place, suggesting that the artist always intended for the break between sky and water to be interrupted by part of the cliff top. But Monet amended this and other passages at a later time, after the first paint layer had dried. He tweaked the placement of the sailboats, removing some and adding others; IR (and visible light) shows that he also reduced the rocky outcropping\u2014editing out a lobe that appears in the companion painting, Edge of the Cliff at Pourville\u2014and added the shadowed area at right to achieve the correct balance (fig. 19.16).\n\nMonet\u2019s \u201cpairs\u201d from 1882 such as Cliff Walk and Edge of the Cliff deserve continued attention. However finished the final composition may seem, the Art Institute\u2019s painting reinforces that Monet\u2019s works from Normandy in the early 1880s were part of a developmental phase. Struggling between two worlds, he was on the cusp of abandoning figure paintings for the rest of his career. While still incorporating human figures in Cliff Walk, he treated them less as modern Parisiennes and more as the abstracted characters from Japanese prints. This tension is manifest not only in the diverse scholarly interpretations the painting has received but also in its physical history.  \nGloria Groom and Jill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Monet\u2019s Cliff Walk at Pourville was painted on a pre-primed no. 25 portrait (figure) linen canvas. There is a stamp from the color merchant Vieille &amp; Troisgros on the verso of the canvas. The canvas exhibits a warp-thread match with Monet\u2019s Apples and Grapes (cat. 17 [W546]), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The ground layer is cream-colored and may consist of a double application. Technical examination has revealed that a different composition was begun on the canvas, although it does not appear to have been fully developed. The final painting has a rich, brush-marked surface with both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint application, the latter suggesting that the painting was carried out in more than one session. The land, sea, and sky were established before the figures were incorporated. The artist then worked up all areas of the composition together. A variety of brushwork was used, ranging from smooth, opaque brushstrokes to more textural strokes of low impasto and finishing touches of local color that skip across the high points of the paint texture beneath. In the final stages, the artist made changes to the right cliff face and to some of the sailboats along the horizon.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 19.17).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 82 (lower right corner, in red paint, fig. 19.18). Most of the underlying paint was dry when the signature and date were applied, except for a few strokes of pale purplish-gray paint, which were probably added as final touches just before the painting was signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nWhen the painting was lined in 1972\u201373, the stretcher was replaced with one of slightly larger dimensions (see Conservation History). The original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 81 cm, which corresponds to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size stretcher, turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 19.1V (0.4) \u00d7 20.0H (0.7) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. The painting shows a warp-thread match with Monet\u2019s Apples and Grapes (cat. 17, Technical Report).\n\nThere is fairly regular cusping around all four edges. It appears to be more pronounced on the left and right sides.\n\nCurrent stretching: The current stretching dates to the 1972\u201373 treatment (see Conservation History). The canvas is attached with copper tacks spaced approximately 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Cusping in the canvas corresponds to the placement of the original tack holes, which are spaced approximately 6\u20137.5 cm apart. There are also three\u2013six randomly placed pinholes on each tacking margin.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered redwood ICA spring stretcher dating to the 1972\u201373 treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretcher: The stretcher that preceded the 1972\u201373 treatment may have been the original. It is described in an undated report as five membered, including a vertical crossbar with butt-ended, mortise and tenon joints, ten keys, and the following dimensions: overall, 65.5 cm \u00d7 81.5 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; inside depth, 2 cm; width, 6.5 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.8 cm; and length of mortise, 5 cm.\n\nThere is a supplier\u2019s stamp on the back of the original canvas. Before the painting was lined in 1973 (see Conservation History), a tracing of the stamp was made. The text (not completely legible) is contained within a palette shape: \u201c[H.] VIEILLE E. TROISGROS [. . .] / 35 RUE DE LAVAL 35 / PARIS / COULEURS FINES / TOILES PANNEAUX (fig. 19.19).\u201d The transmitted infrared image shows traces of the stamp, which is located on the midleft side of the back of the painting (fig. 19.20).\n\nNot determined, probably glue.\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground is relatively thick (60\u2013125 \u00b5m) and may consist of a double application (fig. 19.21). When the cross section is viewed under ultraviolet (UV) light, the upper region of the ground exhibits a distinct fluorescence compared with the lower region (fig. 19.22). The backscattered electron (BSE) image shows the lower region to be slightly more compact and richer in lead white, as evidenced by its brighter white appearance (fig. 19.23). Several bubble holes were observed in the ground layer during microscopic examination of the painting.\n\nObserving the painting microscopically, the ground appears to be cream colored, with scattered red, black, and yellow particles (fig. 19.24).\n\nThe upper and lower regions of the ground were found to have the same composition. This consists of a mixture of primarily lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, bone black, silicate minerals, alumina, and silica.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe paint layer is fairly continuous throughout the composition, with the cream-colored ground layer visible in only a few localized areas through breaks in the brushstrokes, most notably at the lower corners (fig. 19.25). Brushwork unrelated to the final composition is clearly visible in the transmitted-infrared image (fig. 19.26), particularly in the upper half of the painting. This indicates that Monet initially planned a different landscape or seascape composition for the canvas. The earlier composition consists of strong directional strokes that delineate the major forms, but it does not appear to have been developed very far. Although the first composition is not easily discernible in the X-ray, its presence helps to explain the rather vigorous brushwork seen there, especially when compared with the final image (fig. 19.27). A distinct, three-lobed form, which does not correspond to the final image, is visible in transmitted infrared (IR) in the lower-left quadrant of the painting (fig. 19.28); however, it is unclear what this form represents.\n\nIn the final composition, the three main areas\u2014sky, sea, and cliff\u2014were worked up simultaneously. The earliest paint layers in each area seem to consist of more subdued colors than those used in the upper layers. The sky has a pale blue-gray underlayer that is visible intermittently along the horizon line and is used for the light-gray tones of the clouds (fig. 19.29). Areas around the edges of the clouds, where this underlayer is left exposed, represent some of the more translucent passages of paint application (fig. 19.30). The artist then applied thicker strokes of lead white paint, subtly toned with traces of cobalt blue and vermilion, to further build up the clouds. The more intense blue paint in the upper part of the sky was applied around the clouds, coming up over their edges in places (fig. 19.31). The sea was painted in with a pale greenish-gray hue, which remains readily evident through the network of individual strokes applied over it (fig. 19.32). In contrast, the dense brushwork of the grassy cliff top makes it difficult to discern the earliest layers in that area of the composition. Small glimpses suggest that the underpainting is more variable there than in the sky and water: a thin, dull green paint was observed in some places (fig. 19.33), and a pale pinkish-beige appeared in others. The presence of an overall underpainting layer in the sky and water is somewhat unusual when compared with other Monet paintings studied for this project and may have been applied to cover the earlier composition in the areas where it was most developed before the artist began the final composition. Both the sea and the cliffs were built up using individual touches of color, applied in roughly horizontal, curving strokes for the waves and more randomly oriented strokes in the wind-swept grass. In these areas, the artist made use of low-impasto brushwork and light strokes that skip across the high points of the underlying texture (fig. 19.34, fig. 19.35), a combination that helps to create a sense of depth and movement. Monet often picked up two or more colors on his brush that he laid onto the canvas in strokes of unmixed color. The two figures seem to have been added after the elements of the landscape were already established in the initial painting stage (fig. 19.36). Several places around the edges of the figures show that the underlying layers of the cliff, water, and sky were already dry when the figures were painted (fig. 19.37). The figures and the landscape elements were then all worked up simultaneously. The garments consist of a thick buildup of strokes applied wet-in-wet, but with little actual blending of colors on the canvas (fig. 19.38). Some of the final strokes of the grass and figures were applied back and forth, wet-in-wet, blurring the boundary between them.\n\nAt an earlier stage of the painting of the final composition, the horizon line extended farther to the right edge of the canvas (fig. 19.39). The shadowed area of the cliff at right was a later addition to the composition. Where there are small losses and gaps in the dark-brown paint of the shadow, pale shades of pink, green, blue, and cream relating to the water and sky are visible (fig. 19.40). Tiny areas of interlayer cleavage suggest that the underlying layers were at least surface dry when the paint of the cliff shadow was applied on top, resulting in poor adhesion between the layers. The compositional change could indicate that the artist altered his viewpoint after beginning the painting, or the revision may have been an aesthetic decision. The adjacent sunlit portion of the cliff at the far right, however, seems to have been part of the composition from early on. The paint in this area is fairly continuous, with few breaks in the brushwork, but where it is visible (mainly along the left edge), only the pale-gray underpainting of the sky, and not the more intense blue of the finished sky, continues underneath the cliff (fig. 19.41). This suggests that the extreme right part of the cliff was in place before the sky was fully developed. A small modification was made at the upper-left contour of the right cliff face, where it originally bulged farther to the left (fig. 19.42). This was then painted over with blue paint from the sky. The still-wet dark-green and brown paint from the cliff was probably wiped away first, as only traces are visible through the thin blue paint (fig. 19.43).\n\nThe artist also made some changes to the small sailboats, modifying them at different stages of the painting process. Between the heads of the two women and just in front of the white-sailed boat on the far right, short brushstrokes rich in lead white below the surface suggest that two additional sailboats were originally included in these areas and then subsequently painted out (fig. 19.44). The white-sailed boat on the far right of the finished painting (fig. 19.45) was added before the application of the intense blue of the water that covers part of the large sail, whereas the boat on the far left was added last, after the water was completed (fig. 19.46), further demonstrating the back-and-forth nature of the painting process.\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 and 1.5 cm wide, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes) and possibly smaller brushes for finer details. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, chrome yellow, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue (fig. 19.47), ultramarine blue, viridian, emerald green, vermilion, and red lake. UV examination of the painting surface indicates the use of red lake in the grass, the costumes, and the signature.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently unvarnished. It has a soft, subtly variable surface depending on the qualities of the paint application. The synthetic varnish applied in 1973 was removed in 2011; it is not known when the natural-resin varnish, which was removed in 1973, was applied (see Conservation History).\n\nIn 1972\u201373 yellowed varnish and overpaint were removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. The surface was coated with polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA, and inpainting was carried out at small losses and around the edges. A spray coat of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final coating of AYAA.\n\nIn 2011 the synthetic varnish layers were removed along with residues from an earlier natural-resin varnish. The painting was left unvarnished. Fills from a previous treatment were left intact around the edges, and, where necessary, new fills were added and existing fills leveled or textured. Small losses were inpainted.\n\nThe work is in good condition overall. The canvas is wax-resin lined. It is flat and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. The paint layer is in good condition, with only a few tiny paint losses and localized interlayer cleavage in the cliff shadow and sky at right. All areas are secure. There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint. Slight flattening and moating around areas of low impasto are probably due to the lining procedure. There is a general network of light mechanical cracks over the paint surface and areas of fine drying cracks in the dark shadows of the cliffs. Light stretcher-bar cracks are visible, most notably on the left side and over the area of the original vertical crossbar. There are series of tiny splatters running horizontally across the upper sky, midway down the water on the left side, and near the lower left corner. These have etched slightly into the paint, causing matte brown discolorations. These small spots have been inpainted, along with areas of loss and abrasion at the original foldovers. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberely Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed by Apr. 6, 1932): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, early-twentieth-century, Durand-Ruel, R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast corner and center cartouches on a crosshatched bed with leaf\u2013tip-and-shell sight molding. The frame has both water and oil gilding; the scotia sides are gold-toned silver leaf. Red bole was used on the perimeter molding, the scotia sides, the foliate ornament on the ogee and the sight molding, and the liner. A red-orange bole was used on the sanded frieze and the fillets. No bole was applied to the crosshatched ogee bed between the foliate ornament. The frame has a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face and is mitered and nailed at the corners. The back of the frame has been planed flat, a back frame was glued on, and all of the wood surfaces were painted, removing all construction history and provenance. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized dovetail pierced egg-and-flower outer molding; scotia side; ogee face with a cast crosshatched bed and corner and center foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; sanded front frieze bordered with a fillet; ogee stylized egg-and-dart molding with floral motif; and an independent fillet liner with a cove sight (fig. 19.48, fig. 19.49, and fig. 19.50).\n\nPrevious frame: A photograph of the painting in the 1905 Durand-Ruel exhibition at the Grafton Galleries, London, shows the painting framed in a Durand-Ruel Louis XVI Revival frame with burnished ribbon-and-stave moldings.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by [unknown] to Hayes, by Mar. 1, 1883.\n\nAcquired by Hermann Kapferer, Paris, by July 17, 1888.\n\nSold by Hermann Kapferer, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, July 17, 1888, for 1,200 francs.\n\nPossibly sold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, by Apr. 26, 1928.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932), Chicago, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galeries Durand-Ruel, Exposition des oeuvres de Claude Monet, Mar. 1\u201325, 1883, cat. 20, as Promenade sur la Falaise.

A number of publications were particularly helpful in elucidating Monet\u2019s biographical and art historical chronology at this moment: Robert L. Herbert, Monet on the Normandy Coast: Tourism and Painting, 1867\u20131886 (Yale University Press, 1994); Michael Clarke and Richard Thomson, Monet: The Seine and the Sea, 1878\u20131883, exh. cat.

Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995).\n\nIn February 1882, Monet traveled to Dieppe (and on to nearby Pourville) from Poissy. Returning home to Poissy in mid-April, the artist brought almost forty paintings back with him; later that same month, he sold his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, twenty-three works. See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 6. Considering his successful trip in February, Monet\u2019s eagerness to return to the area from mid-June to early October is understandable. Robert L. Herbert discusses the increased market for Monet\u2019s seascapes at this time, noting that \u201cwe cannot look upon his marines as disinterested visual poetry. They were his produce, sent back to the capital to be sold.\u201d See Robert L. Herbert, Monet on the Normandy Coast: Tourism and Painting, 1867\u20131886 (Yale University Press, 1994), pp. 43\u201344.\n\nDaniel Wildenstein attempts to identify many of the locations, titles, and dates.

Although the early horizon line is perhaps similar in form to those he included in his many V\u00e9theuil landscapes of 1879, it seems highly unlikely that Monet started the initial composition at that time, took it with him to the coast in 1882, and painted over it. In 1881 Monet renewed his business relationship with Durand-Ruel, making it his best year for total art sales since 1873; see Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 207. Furthermore, if, as Robert L. Herbert has suggested, there was a revitalized market for Monet\u2019s marines and they \u201cwere his produce, sent back to the capital to be sold,\u201d it is difficult to conceive that he had a hard time acquiring new painting supplies in the summer of 1882. See Robert L. Herbert, Monet on the Normandy Coast: Tourism and Painting, 1867\u20131886 (Yale University Press, 1994), p. 44.\n\nThis observation was also noted in John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 185. The painting has been the topic of investigation in several exhibition catalogues and monographs, and various interpretations of the X-ray have been surmised from House. Richard Thomson notes that Monet \u201cbroke the flat horizon of the sea by arbitrarily adding an extra bluff to the right\u201d and that this \u201cright-hand shoulder in the Chicago canvas was not originally in the painting, but was added.\u201d See Richard Thomson, \u201cLooking to Paint: Monet, 1878\u20131883,\u201d in Michael Clarke and Richard Thomson, Monet: The Seine and the Sea, 1878\u20131883, exh. cat. (National Galleries of Scotland, 2003), p. 31; and his entry for the Art Institute\u2019s painting in Michael Clarke and Richard Thomson, Monet: The Seine and the Sea, 1878\u20131883, exh. cat. (National Galleries of Scotland, 2003), p. 136. The entry for the painting in Heather Lemonedes, Lynn Federle Orr, and David Steel, Monet in Normandy, exh. cat. (Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco/North Carolina Museum of Art/Cleveland Museum of Art, 2006), p. 106, states that the X-ray suggests a third figure may have been included in the painting. Evidence in the following technical report does not correspond with these observations, however.\n\nFor further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming).

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis of the signature area, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination, indicates that the paint mixture contains vermilion and red lake. Other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CliffWlk\\_33\\_443\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 15, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_443\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet Cliff Walk at Pourville 1882 (W0758/1933.443),\u201d July 2011.\n\nSee Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: W546, W758, Claude Monet,\u201d June 2014. This suggests that the canvases for the two paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert Erdmann, \u201cThread Count, Weave, and Ground Analysis of Claude Monet\u2019s Vieille &amp; Troisgros/Troisgros Fr\u00e8res canvases in the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d in Painting Techniques: History, Materials and Studio Practice (Rijksmuseum, forthcoming).

A sample of wood from the stretcher was retained.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to confirm from cross sections due to previous conservation treatment, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThis is very similar to what was observed in the ground layer of Apples and Grapes (cat. 17), which was found to have a weave match with this painting. It should be noted, however, that the identification of single versus multiple layers of a single ground formulation from cross-sectional analysis can be difficult due to changes that occur in the materials with drying and aging. For a discussion of the challenges and caveats of interpreting ground layers in cross sections, see Leslie Carlyle, Jaap J. Boon, Ralph Haswell, and Martje Stols-Witlox, \u201cHistorically Accurate Ground Reconstructions for Oil Paintings,\u201d in Preparation for Painting: The Artist\u2019s Choice and Its Consequences, ed. Joyce H. Townsend et al. (Archetype, 2008), pp. 110\u201322.\n\nThe ground was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. Traces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_443\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2011; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CliffWalk\\_33\\_443\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 15, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe central cliff\u2019s shadow seems to have been part of the original conception for the final composition.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, cobalt blue, viridian, emerald green, and vermilion (XRF, SEM/EDX, PLM); chrome yellow, ultramarine blue (SEM/EDX, PLM); red lake (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_CliffWalk\\_33\\_443\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d July 15, 2011; and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_443\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 21, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination of the painting, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.

They are documented in the 1973 pretreatment photographs, and a note in the Art Institute\u2019s files regarding a photograph of the painting taken in 1957 is annotated with the word \u201cstained,\u201d which could relate to these \u201csplatters.\u201d See receipt 5300, on file in Museum Registration, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nKirk Vuillemot, \u201cMonet Frame Descriptions Final,\u201d Dec. 3, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPaul Mitchell and Lynn Roberts, A History of European Picture Frames (Paul Mitchell/Merrell Holberton, 1996), p. 52.

Hendrik Ziegler also argued that the Chicago painting was probably exhibited as Strand von Pourville in Weimar from June 1, 1890, in Hendrik Ziegler, \u201c\u2018Klein Paris\u2019 in Weimar,\u201d in Aufstieg und Fall der Moderne, ed. Rolf Bothe and Thomas F\u00f6hl, exh. cat.

(Kerber, 2010), p. 228. Ziegler claims that a painting by Ludwig von Gleichen-Russwurm from summer 1890 called Auf den Klippen von Helgoland has strong similarities to Cliff Walk at Pourville, which, he argues, may indicate that it was on view in Weimar in 1890. Ziegler also cites period newspapers and Walther Scheidig, Christian Rohlfs (Verlag der Kunst, 1965), p. 316. Based on his transcription of the \u201cAkten Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Weimar, Commissionsbuch I, der Permanenten Kunstaustellung fol. 9. 1890. 27. Mai,\u201d Scheidig noted that \u201cStrand von Purville [sic]\u201d was received from Goupil &amp; Cie, Paris, and sent back to Paris on December 12, 1890. Goupil &amp; Cie, Paris, is not part of the known provenance of this painting, however. Exhibition dates listed here are deduced from the above sources.\n\nAccording to Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vol. 2, Nos. 1\u2013968 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 283\u201384, cat. 758.\n\nAccording to Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Oct. 5, 2010, \u201cCe tableau a particip\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019exposition en 1905 \u00e0 Londres aux Grafton Gallery no. 280,\u201d curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.
