Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The God) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 105). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThe scene in Gauguin\u2019s 1898/99 version of Te atua (The God)\u2014it shares its title with plate 3 of the Noa Noa Suite (1894\u201395; see cat. 53)\u2014takes place before a Polynesian structure, its walls composed of wrapped bamboo posts, crowned by a semicircular arch decorated with crosses. The lozenge shape made by the arch contains a large head in profile. Below the lintel, which bears Gauguin\u2019s monogram and the print\u2019s title, the artist placed three figures and several animals. In the center, on a raised platform, stands a peacock, surrounded by stems and flowers. At the left, a haloed mother holds a child; at the right is a standing figure. Between them is a prone nude, its enlarged head gazing up at the mother and infant. Below the nude is a snake, flanked on the left by a rodent and on the right by a bird.\n\nLike so much of Gauguin\u2019s art, in which the artist quoted from other of his works, Te atua is an amalgam of subjects drawn from a number of his paintings, drawings, and prints, as well as a sculpture. The lunette at the top of the composition contains the head of Ta\u2019aroa, the Polynesian god of creation (fig. 103.1). Its large size and emphatic profile recall those of the severed head on a pillow featured in Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Arii matamoe (The Royal End) (fig. 103.2 [W 453]). Gauguin must have been thinking as well of the head of Oviri, his 1894/95 ceramic sculpture of the Tahitian goddess of death and mourning (fig. 103.3; see cat. 84). In addition, Ta\u2019aroa\u2019s masklike features echo an image in an illustration in the artist\u2019s 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (fig. 103.4). The god\u2019s head appears at the bottom center of page 14, surrounded by symbols related to the creation of the Polynesian universe. The decorated arch in the wood-block print seems to be a shorthand version of the more elaborately decorated structure that surrounds the head in the manuscript.\n\nThe central portion of the wood-block print\u2019s composition, below the title-bearing lintel, includes an exterior wall of a dwelling composed of tightly plaited leaves lashed to bamboo posts. Against the wall\u2019s striated patterns, Gauguin placed a peacock, a Christian symbol of immortality, which struts on a raised surface. The large, exotic bloom at the bird\u2019s left, depicted from the front so that one can see its petals and stamen, recalls the flower and seedpod of the coastal Tou tree (fig. 103.5). The blossom at the right, seen in profile, seems more fanciful (fig. 103.6). The peacock\u2014as well as, less frequently, the peahen\u2014is a ubiquitous presence in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre, in many media, from the late 1890s to the end of his life (see fig. 103.7 [left, Gray 87, fig. 103.8, fig. 103.9 [left, W 484], fig. 103.10 [left and center, W 496], fig. 103.11, fig. 103.12 [W 622], and fig. 103.13).\n\nDirectly in front of this outdoor scene is the prostrate, nude manifestation of Ta\u2019aora, who lifts his head\u2014a small version of the profile in the semicircle above\u2014with its cascading tresses, and extends his dark arms toward the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child at the left. The latter, as well as the single figure at the right, derive from a Christian roadside sculpted shrine of the type that fascinated Gauguin when he was in Brittany, which he depicted in the oil painting Christmas Night (The Blessing of the Oxen) (fig. 103.14 [W 519] and fig. 103.15). The single figure raises one arm in a gesture of fearlessness (abhaya mudra) common in Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain images. This worshipper can be traced as well to one of the three monks in a photograph of a frieze at the Buddhist temple of Borobudur in Central Java, of which Gauguin had a photograph (see fig. 103.16) that he mined continually for motifs. In addition, to beget this figure he layered its Buddhist character with another Southeast Asian source in his repertory\u2014an image of a Cambodian devata (a Hindu deity) (see fig. 103.16, right).\n\nThe prostrate supplicant (fig. 103.17) relates to similar, predominantly female figures that Gauguin included in a variety of contexts in paintings, wood carvings, and graphic media. As has been suggested, the figure may have been informed by a type of carved wooden spear rest common in the Society Islands (see fig. 103.18 [Gray 122]). Another possible source is a pastel image by Edgar Degas (fig. 103.19) of a naked woman extended over her knees, haunches raised, her head resting on folded arms, which Gauguin copied in a sketchbook known as the Album Briant (fig. 103.20). Related to Gauguin\u2019s sketch is an 1893 oil painting, Otahi (Alone) (fig. 103.21 [W 502]), for which there is a drawing that could be a preliminary design idea (fig. 103.22). The figure appears in another image, this time with a pig, from the same time (fig. 103.23). She is the subject of an 1894 monotype, in which she assumes the identity of a nude Mary Magdalene, collapsed in grief under the crucified Christ (fig. 103.24 [Field 1973 26]). This image was clearly influenced by Auguste Rodin\u2019s affecting marble sculpture of a despairing Danaid (fig. 103.25). Gauguin\u2019s figure metamorphoses into a caricatural version, in lurid green with touches of vibrant red, in a woodcarving that adorned the dining area of Gauguin\u2019s home in Punaaiua, on the west coast of Tahiti-Nui (fig. 103.26 [left, Gray 122]).\n\nGauguin reused the prone nude in an ambitious transfer drawing from around 1899 (fig. 103.27 [cat. 123]); here the female, her haunches provocatively lifted in a raw, erotic taunt, plays with a cat. The group of onlookers and archer behind her head derive from another section of the friezes at of the temple of Borobudur, of which the artist had a photograph (fig. 103.28, left). She appears again in a masthead design for the February 1900 issue of Gauguin\u2019s broadsheet Le sourire (The Smile) (fig. 103.29 [Kornfeld 64]). Three versions of the figure appear in Horse with Other Animals and Ornaments, a wood-block print dating from around the same time as the masthead that is difficult to decipher because of its apparently unfinished state (fig. 103.30 and fig. 103.31). The last appearance of the figure in Gauguin\u2019s work occurs in a pen-and-ink illustration for the cover of his 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After), in which the artist presented her as a grotesque figure, with a serpentine body, webbed feet, and\u2014because the proper left eye is covered by her hair\u2014a Cyclops-like face (fig. 103.32).\n\nThe animals below the prone nude appear in a number of other works by Gauguin. Gauguin appropriated the mongoose at the left, which faces the snake in the middle, from the photograph of the Borobudur frieze, in which the rodent consumes a snake (fig. 103.33). One finds a mongoose in another plate from this late series of wood-block prints, Change of Residence (fig. 103.34 [cat. 104.1]). Gauguin repeated the serpent at the top left of the wood-block print Horse, with Other Animals and Ornaments (fig. 103.35). The bird at the right is found in Gauguin\u2019s 1897 oil Vairumati (fig. 103.36 [W 599] and fig. 103.37).\n\nSeveral of the components of Te atua\u2014the Madonna and Child, the peacock, the blessing figure, the head of Ta\u2019aora\u2014reappear in an illustration on page 105 of Avant et apr\u00e8s (fig. 103.38). The image\u2019s central motif\u2014the dead Christ and three female worshippers (the three Marys)\u2014evokes another roadside shrine, which Gauguin had depicted in the 1889 painting The Green Christ (fig. 103.39 [W 328]).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H. Floury, 1927; Alan Wofsy Fine Arts, 1980).\n\nAmong the references to Polynesian mythology and artifacts in Arii matamoe (The Royal End) is a masklike countenance seen to the immediate right of the table on which the severed head rests. Facing forward and featuring large, teardrop eyes outlined in blue, it represents Ta\u2019aroa.\n\nSome impressions of the print allow one to see the petals, stamen, and stigma of the blossom on the right. The unusually large stigma resembles the leaf blades of a venus flytrap.\n\nTilly\u2019s wood engraving of a Cambodian devata also appeared in L\u2019illustration (Sept. 12, 1874), p. 169, ill. 11.\n\nSee John Rewald, Gauguin Drawings, Bittner Art Book (T. Yoseloff, 1958), pl. 78; and Ronald Pickvance, The Drawings of Gauguin (P. Hamlin, 1970), pl. 78.\n\nFor a drawing for the monotype, and a woodcut after the monotype, see Ziva Amishai-Maisels, Gauguin\u2019s Religious Themes (Garland, 1985), figs. 30 and 29, respectively.\n\nScholars differ on when and where Gauguin executed this polychromed wood carving. Christopher Gray\u2019s discussion suggests that the artist made it in Punaaiua on Tahiti-Nui before September 1901; Christopher Gray, Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin (Johns Hopkins Press, 1963; repr., Hacker Art Books, 1980), p. 265. Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, in Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010), p. 131, dated the carving to 1901\u201302, which means he would have made it in Hiva Oa, in the Marquesas, where he was living at that time.\n\nFor other possible sources for this figure, see Ziva Amishai-Maisels, Gauguin\u2019s Religious Themes (Garland, 1985), p. 176.\n\nThe shrine in The Green Christ draws from a fragment of a Calvary scene in a churchyard at Nizon in Brittany.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Top left, Te atua (The God), 1898/99 (cat. 103.1).
