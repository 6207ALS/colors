    "description": "<p>Based in Philadelphia, Thomas Birch was a leading marine painter who helped establish the genre in early 19th-century America. <em>Shipwreck near a Rocky Coast</em> is a romantic, imaginative composition that highlights human struggle against the forces of nature: the ship\u2019s sails are torn, its masts lean to one side, and a tiny group of seafarers attempts to flee the disaster. Birch rendered the scene in dramatic detail, yet left the narrative unresolved.</p>\n",
