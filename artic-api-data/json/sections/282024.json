Whistler made at least two brief trips to Paris in 1891, the first from June 11 to 15 and the second in late October and early November. Both times he stayed at the H\u00f4tel du Helder, on the boulevard des Capucines, within easy walking distance of the rue Colbert. The June trip was crowded with visits to exhibitions, friends, and fellow artists, while during the autumn sojourn Whistler spent much of his time working on lithographs with the printer Belfond. There is no specific evidence to suggest which of these Paris visits produced the Hotel Colbert lithographs, although the second trip seems the more likely.\n\nT. R. Way\u2019s (1905) citation of eight lifetime impressions is far too low. When Whistler died there were at least twenty-four impressions in his estate.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (322 \u00d7 205 mm), signed; MWC, tan laid paper (305 \u00d7 239 mm), signed; SC, ivory laid paper (311 \u00d7 203 mm).
