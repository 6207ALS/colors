According to Joseph Pennell, the figures seated at the table in a shaded area of the garden are Ethel Birnie Philip and her husband, Charles Whibley. The settee on the left appears to be identical to the one depicted in The Garden (cat. 40), a lithograph drawn in 1891 at the Whistlers\u2019 home in Cheyne Walk; presumably, it was moved with the family furniture from Chelsea to Paris.\n\nT\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in the Garden must have been drawn some days prior to 22 July 1894, when Whistler wrote to New York dealer Edward Kennedy, sending him a list of \u201cnew and beautiful lithographs\u201d that were to be mailed to New York from Paris two days later. Among the prints in that shipment were two impressions of T\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate in the Garden. As far as can be determined, the Ways never reprinted this lithograph after the original set of twenty-five impressions (plus a few proofs) was pulled in July 1894.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid Japanese vellum (324 \u00d7 240 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (340 \u00d7 237 mm), signed; Palmer, ivory wove proofing paper (286 \u00d7 225 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (294 \u00d7 200 mm).
