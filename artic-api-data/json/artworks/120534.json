    "description": "<p>Mies van der Rohe realized many influential tall buildings and is widely credited with establishing a minimalist design template for rectangular towers in steel-and-glass office buildings in American cities throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Mies\u2019 first realized towers, however, were a series of residential buildings in Chicago, the most famous of which is 860\u2013880 Lake Shore Drive, completed in 1951. With an economy of line, this sketch for two high-rise buildings illustrates the dynamic, perpendicular relationship of the 860\u2013 880 towers, as well as the uniform columns supporting the buildings\u2019 volumes at ground level, creating a joined arcade and lobbies for the apartments.</p>\n",
