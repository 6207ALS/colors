    "description": "<p>Asher B. Durand was a prominent figure of the Hudson River School who contributed to the rise of American landscape painting in the 1840s and 1850s. His <em>Study of Rocks in Pearson\u2019s Ravine</em> depicts a fragment of forested terrain in the Delaware River Valley in New Jersey. The composition is an example of Durand\u2019s intense investigation of nature, executed outdoors and with a high degree of finish and detail. The artist meticulously rendered the moss-covered stone, flowering groundcover, and botanical variety. Such small-scale canvases represent some of the earliest exhibited plein air (outdoor) painting in the United States.</p>\n",
