    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">In this sheet, several highly realized heads peer out from columns and archways, while on the right a man in a cap plays a clarinet. He is part of the band that extends into folio 6H/I and resembles the workers and sailors seen in some of Ensor\u2019s early drawings. Next to him, a sexually ambiguous figure holds a shofar, the ram\u2019s-horn trumpet used in Jewish religious ceremonies. It is inscribed with words taken directly from Gustave Flaubert\u2019s Temptation of Saint Anthony. They refer to Saint Peter\u2019s vision: Pierre l\u00eave toi! Tue et mange! (Peter, rise up! Kill and eat!). Juxtaposed with the waste products of a defecating and urinating horse, these words invite the saint to partake in the temptations of the flesh that surround him. On the lower left a man in a cap cuts a boar\u2019s throat, releasing a stream of blood that enters the prostrate woman who straddles sheet 7F and folio 7G/H. Wormlike creatures wind around the columns.\n\nThis folio stands alone as a coherent composition, although Saint Anthony\u2019s shoulder extends over a multibreasted figure on the left, marrying the two sheets visually. Scratching creates highlights in the dark face between the columns at center right. A small artist\u2019s patch once covered the genitals of the foremost horse; this area is now visible as a lighter area of the paper. This was removed as part of the latest conservation. Historical restorations are visible at center and along the center bottom edge. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Folio 6F/G. Interactive image.\n\nfig. 2 </section>",
