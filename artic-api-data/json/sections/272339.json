The Dancing Girl seems to be his first representation in lithography of the female figure in motion. Whistler worked with the same light, rhythmical touch he used when sketching with chalk and pastel on brown paper, allowing the grain of the transfer paper to act like the tooth of the coarse drawing paper. In its pose and graphic handling, the lithograph is strikingly close to a pastel on brown paper entitled A Woman Holding a Black Fan (fig. 29a [M 1377]). There are also two related drawings in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., a pastel on brown paper entitled Danseuse ath\u00e9nienne (M 1072) and an untransferred drawing in lithographic crayon on fine-grained transfer paper, Standing Figure (dwg. IX). The obvious kinship between the lithograph and the two delicately colored pastel studies adds credence to T. R. Way\u2019s assertion (1912) that Whistler was at this time beginning to think of making color lithographs.\n\nWay also recorded Whistler\u2019s initial dissatisfaction with this and two other transfer lithographs of lightly draped models (cat. 30 and cat. 31). Although Way (1912) wrote that the artist had asked the printers to remove the three drawings from their stones, his instructions were never carried out, and in 1892, \u201cat a little conference . . . when stock was taken of such drawings as were still upon the stones,\u201d Whistler was pleased that these particular images had been preserved. In fact, he had liked The Dancing Girl well enough to sell an impression to the Fine Art Society on 27 March 1889. In early January 1890 he also sent an impression to his friend St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 in Paris.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), ivory laid paper (320 \u00d7 204 mm), signed; cream chine (214 \u00d7 162 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (313 \u00d7 240 mm); MWC, tan laid paper (312 \u00d7 202 mm); SC, ivory laid paper (314 \u00d7 201 mm), signed.

For further information on the Pettigrews and their appearance in Whistler\u2019s lithographs, see cat. 51, esp. n. 51.1.\n\nThe sale to the FAS is recorded in GUL NB1/8; this indicates an earlier date than was given by T. R. Way (1890). When Whistler sold The Little Dancing Girl to the FAS in 1889, the price was only one guinea. In August 1894, when he sent another impression to the same dealers, the price had been raised to four guineas.\n\nFor Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s comments regarding this lithograph, see Barbier (1964), p. 47, no. XXV.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 29, only state. The Art Institute of Chicago, collection of Mr. and Mrs. A.
