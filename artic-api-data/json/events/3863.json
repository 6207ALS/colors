    "description": "<p>The Art Institute of Chicago is delighted to present the upcoming symposium UNFIXED: Material Challenges in Contemporary Art. Bringing together internationally renowned scholars, museum professionals, and artists, this symposium stages an interdisciplinary exchange on the questions and challenges of materiality in 20th- and 21st-century art and museum practices.<br><br>The first day of the symposium, June 28, will take the form of a scholars\u2019 day, open to the public, featuring prominent art historians, museum professionals, and artists, and will explore the theoretical notions of material complexity and contingency in contemporary art. leading art historians, artists, and museum practitioners will engage with questions of material complexity and contingency of recent art practices, and the evolving, ongoing care of such works in institutions. Topics will include time and action, the electronically or digitally ephemeral, body materializations, installation art, inherent vice, and other modes of dematerialization that continue to challenge scholars inside the confines of the museum and beyond. A second day, June 29, open to our regional network of representatives from invited institutions, will be dedicated to discussing the practical challenges that institutions face concerning time-based media and its preservation.<br><br>Discussions of the materialities of recent art practices have been circulating since the 1960s and have become increasingly relevant to museums since the 1990s as more ephemeral works, including time-based media, have entered collections. Our current moment is drawing forth a generation of new perspectives, tools, and priorities that re-engage established questions and elicit new ones. Twenty-first-century advances in art conservation and science have energized a renewed focus on object-driven inquiry in the disciplines of art history and curating, expanding traditional canons and breaking conventions with an increasingly global vision. Alongside these evolutions, experimental artworks of the 20th century continue to age and create new urgencies that test the protocols and ethics of conservation practices. As our fields take significant steps in new directions, this is an opportune moment to nurture a conversation about ontology and conceptualism, preservation, and ethics.</p><p>The symposium will be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GF3DVVlq83k\">live streamed</a>.<br><br>The keynote address will be given by <a href=\"/event/lecture-naeem-mohaiemen\">Naeem Mohaiemen</a> on June 28 at 6:00.</p><p>><strong>Program</strong>9:00Coffee in Nichols Lobby9:30<strong>Welcome and Introduction</strong><strong>Session I: Opening Keynote</strong> 10:00<strong>Manifestations: The Work of Art as Appearance</strong><br>Miwon Kwon, University of California, Los Angeles11:00</p><p><strong>Approaches to Materiality</strong></p><p><strong>Does the Original Manifestation of Art Still Matter?<br></strong>Carol Mancusi-Ungaro, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York</p><p>Maria Hassabi, Artist, Athens and New York</p><p>><strong>Moderated Discussion</strong><br>Led by Christine Mehring, University of Chicago 12:30Lunch<strong>Session II: Collecting and Preserving the (Im)material </strong>2:00 </p><p><strong>Building a Biography</strong><br>Kate Lewis, Museum of Modern Art, New York</p><p><strong>The Matter of Collections<br></strong>Annie Fletcher, Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven</p><p><strong>Preservation through Display: The Guggenheim Panza Collection Initiative<br></strong>Francesca Esmay, Solomon R.
