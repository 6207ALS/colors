    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Roy Lichtenstein shocked both the public and the art establishment with paintings inspired by comic books and mass-market advertisements. But he often referenced the work of other artists as well-- in this case, Henri Matisse, who, in 1911, made a series of paintings of his studio. Director James Rondeau.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: And so taking that notion from Matisse, Lichtenstein was interested to make these studio pictures, which contain, mini, small, retrospective exhibitions of Lichtenstein\u2019s career.  So while he\u2019s working with existing imagery or previous expressed imagery, it\u2019s not necessarily coming out in the exact form.</p>\n<p>So, for example, this large image in the upper left hand corner of a hand applying what we assume to be medicated ointment to a foot, actually corresponds to a drawing from the early 1960s, not to a large painting.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Lichtenstein did not like to work from real life. He only painted from reproductions. In this painting, the only act of invention is the studio itself.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: The studio space as depicted in these paintings do not correspond at all to Lichtenstein\u2019s actual working space.  The images within them correspond in most cases to actual works by the artist.  But the architecture of the space is purely fictional.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Roy Lichtenstein was one of the first Pop artists Gael Neeson and Stefan Edlis collected.  They say he holds a special place in their collection</p>\n",
