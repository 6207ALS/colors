The resulting image is somewhat difficult to read. According to T. R. Way, the stone was \u201cdestroyed after very few impressions,\u201d suggesting that neither artist nor printer judged the lithograph a complete success. Nevertheless, Whistler was willing to have Staircase included in Way\u2019s 1896 catalogue, and he signed at least two impressions. Way (1905) recorded only four impressions of the print; this number is too low, as at least eight have been located to date.\n\nChicago: AIC, grayish white chine (204 \u00d7 186 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (413 \u00d7 317 mm); MWC, cream laid paper (240 \u00d7 185 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid paper (240 \u00d7 184 mm). Glasgow: HAG, grayish ivory chine (206 \u00d7 168 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (210 \u00d7 168 mm; maximum dimensions including tab with signature). London: BM, grayish white chine (204 \u00d7 168 mm) mounted on white plate paper (383 \u00d7 284 mm). Washington: FGA, grayish ivory chine (204 \u00d7 168 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (383 \u00d7 282 mm); NGA, grayish ivory laid paper (239 \u00d7 180 mm).  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K. Stratis, Martha Tedeschi\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Way (1905) identified this scene only as \u2018the hall of a house.\u2019\n\nAlthough there were no impressions of Staircase in the artist\u2019s estate at the time of his death (GUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 40), Rosalind Birnie Philip either acquired one during his lifetime or did so after 1903; she gave a signed impression to Glasgow University in 1935.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 43, only state.
