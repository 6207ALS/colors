As he often did, Claude Monet misjudged the time he would need to explore and capture the beauty of the place, which he variously called \u201clugubrious,\u201d \u201cterrifying,\u201d and \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d He came for two weeks and stayed for more than two months. This canvas is one of a group depicting the frieze of rock formations known as Port-Goulphar.</p>\n",
