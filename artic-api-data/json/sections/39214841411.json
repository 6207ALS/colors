Braude Memorial Collection, 2012.84\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Two paintings by Manet figured in the Salon that opened on May 1, 1865: Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers (fig. 8.1; cat. 5) and Olympia (fig. 8.2; [RW I 69]). Critics greeted both with incomprehension, reserving particularly savage ridicule for the latter, the single most reviled picture of Manet\u2019s career (and, of course, a work today sometimes considered his masterpiece). Plunged into a depression, the artist escaped Paris and his unwelcome notoriety that summer, traveling to Spain in August to worship at the altar of Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. Before his voyage (and after the close of the Salon), however, an image of this sheet, his first published drawing, appeared in the July 8 issue of L\u2019Autographe au Salon et dans les ateliers, an illustrated guide to the exhibition and its personalities (fig. 8.3). The drawing comprises three vignettes: a waist-length depiction of a boy drinking water from a jug, a bust of a woman in a tasseled mantilla, and a pair of small figures, dressed in Spanish costume and treated at full length. It is signed and dated April 2, 1865.\n\nThe published reproduction, a photomechanical print, apparently after a handmade facsimile of the original drawing, was accompanied by an unsigned caption:\n\nHe who laughs last laughs best! M. Manet has fired his shot today, and the crowd, with ears wide open, has heard his name. If only he can learn to take the time to tidy up and finish off his pictures, you shall see the public marvel at the same painting that has lately caused it such alarm. For M. Manet has rare qualities: originality and character as a draftsman, fluidity and intensity as a colorist. You see it even in these little sketches, which look as though they were made using the tip of a worn quill, with the perfect nonchalance and the picturesque verve of Goya.\n\nThese words offered a rare\u2014even rather brave\u2014vote of confidence in the artist, founded in large part on his skill as a draftsman and his affinity for the Spanish masters. But the author\u2019s characterization of the sheet Manet had submitted as a collection of \u201cpetits croquis\u201d tossed off with an \u201cinsouciance parfaite\u201d was not wholly accurate. Laid in with graphite, elaborated with controlled washes, and finished with deft strokes of opaque black ink, the three vignettes are not so much nonchalant sketches as careful ricordi, each clearly derived from a prior composition.\n\nThe bust of the drinking boy was lifted from Les Gitanos (The Gypsies) (fig. 8.4; [RW I 41]), a scene Manet had painted and etched in 1862 (see fig. 8.5). The woman with the mantilla represents Lola de Valence, the Spanish ballerina he had portrayed in two drawings (fig. 8.6; [RW II 369] and fig. 8.7; [RW II 370]), a painting (fig. 8.8; [RW I 53]), an etching (fig. 8.9 [Harris 33]), and a lithograph (fig. 8.10 [Harris 32]) in 1862 and 1863. The two small full-length figures in Spanish dress\u2014a standing man and a woman seated beside a table\u2014are related to a highly finished drawing (fig. 8.11; [RW II 533]) and a painting (fig. 8.12; [RW I 55]) of Spanish dancers\u2014the same troupe in which Lola de Valence appeared, in residence at the Hippodrome theater during the late summer and early fall of 1862. The three petits croquis were plainly meant to recall three pictures Manet had shown in his breakout exhibition at the Galerie Martinet in early 1863: The Gypsies, Lola de Valence, and The Spanish Ballet. It cannot have been an accident that, while his ambitious, controversial submissions to the Salon of 1865 relied on Flemish and Venetian prototypes\u2014Van Dyck\u2019s Christ Crowned with Thorns (1618\u201320; Museo del Prado), Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino (1538; Uffizi Gallery)\u2014his small, elegant submission to L\u2019Autographe au Salon alluded to his prior success as a painter of Spanish subjects, a pupil of Vel\u00e1zquez, Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, and Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya y Lucientes.\n\nMost other contributors to the publication submitted drawings that bore some relationship to their current Salon entries. Claude Monet, for example, contributed a pen-and-ink drawing (fig. 8.13) after his Mouth of the Seine at Honfleur (fig. 8.14), one of two seascapes he showed with success in that year\u2019s exhibition. Reproduced from a facsimile drawing via gillotage\u2014a somewhat complicated procedure in the course of which the hand-drawn facsimile is itself destroyed\u2014Monet\u2019s design provided readers with the image (fig. 8.15) of a composition that they could see in oils at the Salon. Manet\u2019s contribution, by contrast, not only failed to represent either of his contemporaneously exhibited pictures but also declined to portray a complete composition, offering instead piquant fragments that could easily be mistaken for initial croquis, and thereby essentially passing off as preparatory sketches\u2014almost doodles\u2014vignettes after pictures already painted.\n\nGillotage could reproduce only line, not tone. The decision, therefore, to reproduce Manet\u2019s design by photomechanical means rather than gillotage must have been motivated by a desire to capture the delicate tonal variations of his drawing. Nevertheless, as Antoinette Owen explains, a hand-drawn facsimile was still made after Manet\u2019s original, whether by a staff artist at L\u2019Autographe au Salon or by Manet himself, for it was from the facsimile, and not the original, that the photomechanical print was made (see Compositional Development). Unlike gillotage, photomechanical reproduction would not have destroyed the original sheet, so the question arises: why make a facsimile? One reason may lie in the lower left-hand corner of the Chicago drawing (see fig. 8.16). A tiny rectangle was cut out of the sheet and carefully replaced with the piece where the male figure now stands; the chain lines here do not match those of the surrounding area, and the join appears hastily done, visible to the naked eye.\n\nThese changes were clearly Manet\u2019s own. As Juliet Wilson-Bareau has pointed out, this portion of the drawing was copied not from the painting of the same subject (where the two equivalent figures are differently posed and dressed\u2014the woman holding a fan, and the man standing with his weight on both feet) but almost certainly from a pencil drawing in one of the artist\u2019s sketchbooks, possibly made from life, and today in a private collection (fig. 8.17; [RW II 531]). There the scene is clearer still: the male dancer poses with his proper left leg tendu devant effac\u00e9, while his partner sits beside a table, apparently playing the castanets. Manet most likely miscalculated the amount of space the transposed composition would require in the lower left corner of the Art Institute\u2019s sheet. His first try at the standing figure may, indeed, have run right off the page. Knowing, perhaps, that the drawing would be reproduced via facsimile, he simply cut out the old figure and pasted in a new one. The maker of the facsimile in turn effectively edited out any sign of the revision, removing from the published image any trace of the piecing process.\n\nHere, even as we admire Manet\u2019s petits croquis, we catch a glimpse of the labor behind their insouciance parfaite. As so often in the artist\u2019s work, apparent effortlessness is a carefully constructed fiction, a reminder of Paul Jamot\u2019s assessment nearly a century ago:\n\nIt is, above all, the appearance of facility toward which [Manet] strives. He wishes to give his work, at the moment when it reaches his public, the gift of supreme grace. But he only obtains it\u2014that grace\u2014at the price of long and persistent labor.  \nEmily A. Beeny\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">On this small sheet (fig. 8.18) Manet loosely depicted several figures from his 1862 oil paintings and drawings devoted to Spanish themes. He signed and dated it Manet 2 Avril 1865 in the upper right corner. The lower left corner of the support is pieced, and ink washes continue over this insert.\n\nThe sketches were reproduced using a photomechanical process in the July 8, 1865, issue of the journal L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 et dans les ateliers (fig. 8.19). The printed version differs markedly from the original drawing: the reproduction has more shading and tone, the piecing in the lower left and the stain the upper left on the original drawing are no longer visible, the facial features of the woman in the shawl have been changed, and the edges of the sheet have been cropped. These differences suggest that a facsimile of the original drawing was used to create the intermediary negative in the photomechanical reproduction process.\n\nManet made the sketches with brush and black ink and washes over graphite. He laid in the thicker, more opaque black ink accents last. There are ruled graphite crop lines approximately 1\u20132 mm from the edge of the sheet on all four sides. It is uncertain if Manet drew these crop marks or if they were added by the production studio at L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 when the drawing was being prepared for reproduction.\n\nThe support is a light- to medium-weight, slightly textured ivory laid paper that has discolored to light gray. It was constructed on a double faced-mold without shadows along the chain lines and is characterized in transmitted light by thick tying wires along the chain lines (fig. 8.20). There are 6\u20137 laid lines per 10 mm, and the chain lines are spaced 23 mm apart. The paper is similar to that found in many of Manet\u2019s small sketchbooks, and indeed this sheet may have come from one of those.\n\nThe insert paper in the lower left of the sheet matches the larger sheet. Comparison of the insert\u2019s tone texture and the structure of its laid and chain patterns confirms that it is the same type of paper as the main sheet. Although the horizontal laid lines of the insert align almost perfectly with the larger sheet, the vertical chain lines do not (fig. 8.21). The insert paper may have been taken from the same sketchbook or a similar one, but because the chain lines do not match, we know that the insert was not original to the main sheet.\n\nThere was little attempt to seamlessly join the insert to the original sheet. In many areas of the join there are gaps caused by missing paper fibers, whereas in other areas the two edges overlap (fig. 8.22). When the work is viewed under strong raking light, horizontal and vertical fold creases (now flattened) are revealed. The fold pattern indicates that the paper was folded in half and then in quarters (fig. 8.23). The vertical fold crease passes through the insert paper in the lower left, indicating that the drawing was folded after the insert was added. There are tiny pinholes in all four corners of the support, at the intersection of the ruled graphite lines. The pinholes were likely made during the reproduction process.\n\n181 \u00d7 127 mm\n\nManet / 2 Avril 1865 appears in brush and black ink at the upper right. The inscription reads correctly when the sheet is turned on its long side with Lola in the lower left.\n\nManet faintly sketched the three compositions in hard graphite. Using brush and slightly diluted ink he created the outlines of the figures and some of the shading for each composition. Then he applied undiluted thicker, and thus blacker, ink for emphasis, as, for example, in the darker outlines of the boy\u2019s shirt and the woman\u2019s hair and shawl, and the darker strokes in the costumes of the dancers.\n\nEach of the sketches loosely depicts figures from Manet\u2019s 1862 works devoted to Spanish themes (Curatorial Entry). For example, it is likely that Manet had in mind the graphite drawing Spanish Couple (fig. 8.24) when he sketched the dancers on this sheet. When an image of the graphite drawing is scaled to match the size of the dancers in the sketch and overlaid (fig. 8.25), the tables and the seated women in both images match fairly well. The male dancers, however, do not. The one in the graphite drawing is almost off the page. It is possible that the need to adjust the position of the male dancer on the Art Institute\u2019s sheet motivated Manet\u2019s decision to remove this portion of the original paper support, insert a matching sheet, and redraw the male dancer.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s sheet was reproduced in the July 8, 1865, issue of L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865. Microscopic examination of surviving issues of this magazine revealed that the majority of the images were reproduced as relief etchings using a non-photographic technique called paniconographie by its inventor, Firmin Gillot, but which quickly became known as gillotage. In this process, an ink design on a zinc plate is coated with resin to make it acid-resistant. The part of the plate not protected by the resin is etched down when the plate is immersed in an acid bath, leaving in relief the areas of the plate to be printed. Thus in the resulting print, the inked areas are depressed into the paper, with slight ridges of ink surrounding the printed edge (fig. 8.26). A few images in L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 were not reproduced solely by a mechanical process. Where the original drawing possessed subtle shading and tonal transitions\u2014as in Manet\u2019s Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies,\u201d \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d and \u201cLola de Valence\u201d\u2014photomechanical reproduction was employed. Under magnification, the matrix of dots created by the half-tone screen can be seen clearly (fig. 8.27).\n\nWhether the reproduction process was mechanical or photomechanical, drawn facsimiles of the original drawings were consistently used to transfer the designs to the zinc plates. As James Ganz and Richard Kendall explain, \u201cThe editors [of L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865] employed a staff of seven professional draftsmen who created the facsimiles on lithographic transfer paper of the original works submitted. These copies would then be handed over to a specialist in gillotage for transfer and etching in relief on zinc plates.\u201d Although it meant an extra step for the production studio, the creation of a facsimile allowed the editors to reproduce the drawing at whatever size they wished, in order to arrange as many illustrations and texts on the page as possible. For example, an original drawing by Monet measures 245 \u00d7 360 mm, while the facsimile and reproduction are significantly reduced, to 156 \u00d7 275 mm. Similarly, Manet\u2019s drawing measures 181 \u00d7 127 mm, while the reproduced image measures 175 \u00d7 120 mm. The facsimile drawings were, of course, destroyed in the acid bath, while the originals were preserved.\n\nBecause the plates and thus the reproductions were made from facsimiles drawn by others, it is unsurprising that they do not look the same as the original drawings. Compare, for example, Monet\u2019s original brush and brown ink drawing, Mouth of the Seine at Honfleur (fig. 8.28) with the reproduction published in L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 (fig. 8.29). So, too, does Manet\u2019s Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies,\u201d \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d and \u201cLola de Valence\u201d differ from its reproduction, as can be seen when the images are overlaid (fig. 8.30). If Manet\u2019s original drawing had been the source for the negative, it is unlikely that there would be so many differences between the drawing and the reproduction, which strongly suggests that a facsimile was the source of the negative and an intermediate step between the original drawing and the reproduction.\n\nSince its acquisition in 2012, the work has not been conserved, but it appears to have been lined to a secondary paper support at some point in time. Much of the backing has been removed, except in the lower left, where it secures the insert to the larger sheet. The presence of this residual lining also increases the opacity of the sheet in the lower left. Beta radiography of the sheet reveals the light-blocking capacity of the remaining lining. The gaps between the insert and the larger sheet have been retouched directly on the surface of the lining paper. The retouched areas are clearly visible bleeding through the residual lining on the verso (fig. 8.31). It is not known what part, if any, Manet had in the lining and retouching.\n\nThe drawing is in fair condition. The insert paper does not align correctly and there are overlaps and gaps at the joined edges. There is a yellow stain in the upper left. Under ultraviolet (UV) radiation the stain in the upper left has a fluorescence characteristic of oil. This oil-induced staining likely could have happened in the artist\u2019s studio. Examination under UV radiation also reveals bright white spots throughout the sheet, not visible in normal light. This may be evidence of fungal or other biological damage to the sheet. The sheet also displays surface soiling from handling. There are small edge tears and losses and pinholes in all four corners. The residual backing paper on the verso has caused a slight convex distortion in the lower left area of the sheet. Raking light reveals horizontal and vertical fold creases. One crease goes though the insert, indicating that it was already attached at the time the work was folded.  \nAntoinette Owen\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Maurice Exsteens (1887\u20131962), Paris.\n\nAcquired by Heinrich Stahl (1868\u20131942), Berlin, for Otto Gerstenberg (1848\u20131935), Berlin, July 1929.\n\nProbably by descent to his daughter, Margarethe Scharf (1889\u20131961), Berlin.\n\nProbably sold by Margarethe Scharf to Otto Wertheimer (1896\u20131973), Paris, 1947.\n\nSold by Otto Wertheimer to Dorothy Braude Edinburg (1921\u20132014), Brookline, Mass., Feb. 1967.\n\nGiven by Dorothy Braude Edinburg to the Art Institute of Chicago, 2012.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Galerie Huguette Ber\u00e8s, Manet: Dessins, aquarelles, eaux-fortes, lithographies, correspondance, 1978, n.p., cat. 10 (ill.), as Le buveur d\u2019eau\u2014Danseurs espagnoles\u2014Lola de Valence.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Drawings in Dialogue: Old Master Through Modern, The Harry B. and Bessie K.

The publication was an offshoot of L\u2019Autographe, which collected autograph letters, poems, and the like penned by celebrities, and published them in facsimile; it appeared biweekly from December 1863 through November 1865. L\u2019Autographe au Salon et dans les ateliers was a weekly periodical published during the spring and summer months of 1864 and 1865\u2014that is, during the annual Salon exhibition\u2014and focusing exclusively on visual artists.\n\nEach vignette was assigned its own number in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of Manet's oeuvre: Boy with Pitcher, (RW II 460, Bust of Lola de Valence, (RW II 371), and Spanish Ballet (RW II 532); see Denis Rouart and Daniel Wildenstein, \u00c9douard Manet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Pastels, aquarelles et dessins (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1975).\n\nL\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 et dans les ateliers, July 8, 1865, p. 87. The original French reads, \u201cRira bien qui rira le dernier! M. Manet a tir\u00e9 son coup de pistolet, aujourd\u2019hui, et toutes les oreilles grandes ouvertes de la foule ont retenu son nom. Qu\u2019il prenne seulement le temps, \u00e0 l\u2019avenir, de nettoyer et de ficeler ses tableaux, et vous verrez le public s\u2019\u00e9merveiller de cette m\u00eame peinture qui l\u2019a effarouch\u00e9 si fort. Car M. Manet a de rares qualit\u00e9s d\u2019originalit\u00e9 et de caract\u00e8re, comme dessinateur, de souplesse et de mordant comme coloriste. On peut s\u2019en apercevoir rien qu\u2019\u00e0 ces petits croquis qui semblent faits du bout d\u2019une plume us\u00e9e avec l\u2019insouciance parfaite et la verve pittoresque de Goya.\u201d All translations are by the author unless otherwise noted.\n\nJuliet Wilson-Bareau has pointed out this bravery; see Wilson-Bareau, Manet: Dessins, aquarelles, eaux-fortes, lithographies, correspondance, exh. cat. (Galerie Huguette Ber\u00e8s, 1978), cat. 10, n.pag.\n\nThe fact that the three drawings that comprise this sketch sheet have sometimes been mistaken for preparatory studies would probably have pleased Manet; see, for example, David Croal Thomson, \u201cThe Paris Salon of Fifty Years Ago,\u201d The Studio 65, 268 (Aug. 1915), p. 162, where the water drinker is described as \u201cone of the painter\u2019s first ideas for a picture which afterwards became celebrated.\u201d Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies,\u201d \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d and \u201cLola de Valence\u201d has some connection to Manet\u2019s preparatory drawings: it bears no watermark, but its laid- and chain-line patterns are similar to those of sheets with JOYNSON watermarks noted by Juliet Wilson-Bareau in two Manet sketchbooks (today dispersed): the \u201cItalian\u201d sketchbook, containing early drawings made in Italy, and the \u201cTuileries\u201d sketchbook, filled with studies used for Music in the Tuileries (1862; National Gallery, London [RW I 51]). The dimensions of Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies\u201d, \u201cThe Spanish Ballet\u201d, and \u201cLola de Valence,\u201d however, exceed the maximum sheet dimensions of pages from either sketchbook: 158 \u00d7 93 mm and 185 \u00d7 112 mm, respectively.

Adolphe Tabarant tells us that Manet painted a group of dancers from the so-called Ballet Espagnol at the capacious studio of Alfred Stevens, Manet\u2019s close friend (and, at that time, a considerably more successful artist). As Juliet Wilson-Bareau has pointed out, Manet could also have drawn the dancers from life during a performance and worked up his studies into a painting, possibly with the help of photographs; see \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d in Gary Tinterow et al., Manet/Vel\u00e1zquez, pp. 488-89, cat. 136; Elizabeth Anne McCauley, A.A.E.

On the drawing and its reproduction, see James Ganz and Richard Kendall, The Unknown Monet: Pastels and Drawings, exh. cat.

I am grateful to Antoinette Owen for this reference and for her many insights into the reproduction of Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies,\u201d \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d and \u201cLola de Valence.\u201d\n\nThe anonymous author of the accompanying paragraph in L\u2019Autographe au Salon was apparently taken in by this deception. See L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 et dans les ateliers, July 8, 1865, p. 87.\n\nThe drawing was last published in Impressionist and Nineteenth Century Art, sale cat. (Christie\u2019s, South Kensington, March 18, 1999), lot 15I, p. 10 (photograph cropped). I wish to thank Juliet Wilson-Bareau for drawing this connection and the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Department of Prints and Drawings for sharing related correspondence (Juliet Wilson-Bareau, e-mail message to Emily Vokt, February 27, 2005; e-mail message to Suzanne F.

The original French, on p. 149, reads, \u201cc\u2019est surtout \u00e0 l\u2019apparence de la facilit\u00e9 qu\u2019il vise. Il veut faire \u00e0 son \u0153uvre, dans l\u2019\u00e9tat o\u00f9 il la livre au public, le don de cette gr\u00e2ce supr\u00eame. Mais il ne l\u2019obtient, cette gr\u00e2ce qu\u2019au prix d\u2019un labeur long et acharn\u00e9.\u201d\n\nL\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 et dans les ateliers should not be confused with L\u2019Autographe, even though both were produced by the same publisher. L\u2019Autographe, which was published from December 5, 1863, through November 25, 1865, encompassed facsimiles of letters, musical scores, poems, political declarations, and sketches by famous celebrities, diplomats, financiers, magistrates, orators, politicians, and soldiers, as well as by architects, comedians, composers, historians, inventors, painters, poets, sculptors, and writers. L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1865 et dans les ateliers was issued every Saturday from April 29, 1865, through July 15, 1865, and reproduced images of the pictures shown at that year\u2019s Salon. (The previous year\u2019s version, L\u2019Autographe au Salon de 1864 et dans les ateliers, was published only twice, on April 28, 1864, and June 10, 1864).\n\nAlthough Sketches from \u201cThe Gypsies\u201d, \u201cThe Spanish Ballet,\u201d and \u201cLola de Valence\u201d does not have a watermark, the paper matches Manet\u2019s Sketches of Snails, Flowering Plant (see cat. 4) in texture, weight, and laid and chain structure. This work bears a partial watermark [ . . . ] [Y]NSON / [1]864. Juliet Wilson-Bareau has observed partial Joynson (for Joynson Paper Mill) watermarks in a number of Manet\u2019s sketchbooks. Juliet Wilson-Bareau, e-mail message to Emily Vokt Ziemba, February 27, 2005, curatorial file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTransmitted light and beta radiography reveal that the laid and chain line measurements in the insert match those of the main sheet. The insert has 6\u20137 laid lines per 10 mm, and the chain lines are spaced 23 mm apart.\n\nJuliet Wilson-Bareau, e-mail message to Suzanne Folds McCullagh, May 29, 2014, curatorial file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis was not, however, one of Manet\u2019s Salon entries for that year.
