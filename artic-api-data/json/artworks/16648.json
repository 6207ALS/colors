The painting was part of Paul Gauguin\u2019s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six C\u00e9zannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, \u201cexcept in a case of direst necessity.\u201d (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.) Although the version in this painting is nearly to scale with the original, it is more a translation than a copy, with rhythmical arabesques that are characteristic of Gauguin\u2019s painting style rather than C\u00e9zanne\u2019s.</p>\n",
