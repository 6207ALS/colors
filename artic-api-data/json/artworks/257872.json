    "description": "<p>Since the late 1960s, Mary Lovelace O\u2019Neal has expanded the field of abstract painting through her experiments with color, figuration, and materiality often speaking to the sociopolitical dimensions of race. <em>Running with Black Panthers and White Doves</em> was inspired by O\u2019Neal\u2019s travels in Morocco, particularly, in the artist\u2019s own words, by \u201cthe biblical presence of North Africa, and a palace in Asilah, Morocco\u2014the mosaics and moonlight that smeared the ocean.\u201d The work derives its title from the dialogue of the black king in Gian Carlo Menotti\u2019s Amahl and the Night Visitors: \u201cI live in a black marble palace with black panthers and white doves.\u201d</p>\n<p>While the title conjures the civil rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, in which O\u2019Neal was an active participant, the painting is anchored in the artist\u2019s personal experience, particularly her relationship to her father. O\u2019Neal performed in the opera Amahl and the Night Visitors, which her father, a music director at the University of Arkansas and Tougaloo College, staged each year. Merging the personal, the lyrical, and the political, <em>Running with Black Panthers and White Doves</em> transfigures O\u2019Neal\u2019s political views and aspirations into allegorical form, as the North African courtyard becomes the interior where, as the opera suggests, a black panther resides in perpetual motion.</p>\n",
