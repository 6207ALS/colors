    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator Gloria Groom.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: So this is Pommiers en fleurs and it\u2019s important for many reasons. It\u2019s important in the exhibition because it really gets us into the story of Monet in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Research Associate Kathryn Kremnitzer.</p>\n<p>Kathryn Kremnitzer: Apple Trees in Blossom is the first painting by Monet to be purchased by a<br>Chicago institution. In 1895, the Union League Club of Chicago purchased the painting from one of its<br>members, whose name is Judge John Barton Payne, and we know that they bought the painting for five<br>hundred dollars, and that reactions at the time were mixed. The president of the club at the time was not so much a fan of the work or of Monet in general and scoffed, \u201cWho would pay five hundred dollars for that blob of paint?\u201d</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: It\u2019s a wonderful tie-in with the Art Institute because several of our trustees were also on<br>the board of the Union League Club, so there is this kind of synergy between these two important cultural institutions in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Kathryn Kremnitzer: Another interesting fact to consider is that the painting was included in Monet\u2019s first solo exhibition at a U.S. museum. It was shown at the Art Institute in March of 1895, which was organized by Paul Durand-Ruel.</p>\n<p>Gloria Groom: Durand-Ruel was Monet\u2019s most important dealer throughout his career, really, and who<br>really made the connections with America at a time when Monet was almost against having his paintings<br>come to America because he wanted them to be known in France, but Durand-Ruel was smart enough to<br>know that the audience was across the ocean.</p>\n<p>Kathryn Kremnitzer: So it\u2019s because of Durand-Ruel that Monet has become a household name, not<br>only in France, but particularly in the United States.</p>\n",
