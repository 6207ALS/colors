Ryerson Collection, 1933.1176\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Writing in late November 1881 from Naples to his friend and patron Paul Berard, Renoir revealed a fondness for Italian food: \u201cI\u2019m eating cooking with garlic, which I adore.\u201d Part of his enjoyment of travel was learning about local culture: the distinctive art and architecture but also the cuisine of the region. In Fruits of the Midi the artist paid tribute to the culture of Italy, composing a still life that features the bounty of the warm Mediterranean climate: peppers, eggplants, tomatoes, pomegranates, citrons, lemons, and oranges.\n\nIn Italy Renoir was as much captivated by everyday life and the effects of light on the landscape as he was with the Old Master and Renaissance treasures that were the primary objective of the trip. It was probably his interest in experiencing the everyday that led him to visit the region of Calabria, located at the toe of the boot, then one of the most impoverished and undeveloped parts of the country. Renoir found \u201cwonders\u201d in this little-visited destination, with its age-old traditions and an economy unspoiled by modern industry.\n\nThough the Chicago still life is rustic in subject, Douglas Druick has suggested that it reflects the classical sense of calm and monumentality that Renoir encountered in the Old Master paintings he saw in Rome. \u201cThere is an austerity here that is new in the art of Renoir, signaled by the relative plainness of both tablecloth and background.\u201d\n\nBarbara White was the first scholar to identify Fruits of the Midi as one of the two still lifes that Renoir mentioned in a letter to his friend and patron Charles Deudon, written in Naples in late November or early December 1881: \u201cI am going to send in a few days one or two still lifes; there is one that is good.\u201d The other painting is undoubtedly Onions (fig. 14.1 [Dauberville 58]), inscribed and dated \u201cNaples. 81.\u201d The two are closely related in subject matter, handling, use of color, and compositional arrangement. Both were purchased by the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in May 1882 as part of a group of seventeen works produced during 1881\u201382. The Chicago still life was almost certainly the work in this group titled Fruits du midi.\n\nThese two paintings could be pendants, if not for the difference in size and format: Fruits of the Midi corresponds to a no. 15 landscape (paysage) standard-size canvas (65 \u00d7 50 cm), and Onions to a slightly smaller no. 12 seascape (marine) standard-size canvas (60 \u00d7 38 cm). Both works reflect a firm, carefully delineated modeling of the still-life elements with generous amounts of paint applied with a controlled brush\u2014quite distinct from the loose handling seen in works of the 1870s or even in the landscapes he was painting at about the same time, The Bay of Naples (Morning) (fig. 14.2 [Dauberville 166]) and The Bay of Naples (Evening) (fig. 14.3 [Dauberville 167]). In both still lifes, Renoir contrasted textures and colors: the papery skins of the onions topped with the crinkled line of dried roots are as convincingly portrayed as the deep aubergine of the eggplant and the brilliant sheen of the buckled and seamed red pepper next to it. In each painting, the arrangement is set on a round table covered with a pristine white cloth. The natural light reflecting off the objects suggests that they are near a window receiving plenty of sunlight. Both backgrounds were built up with longer, directional brushwork more in keeping with a looser style of Impressionism and provide little clue as to setting.\n\nThe backgrounds and tablecloths in both paintings are also chromatically harmonized with the still-life objects depicted. The golden yellows of the onions can be seen in muted form throughout the background of Onions, in the same way that the green, mauve, blue, and even red in the background of Fruits of the Midi reflect the richer tones in the eggplant, citron, leaves, and pomegranates. The body and weight of the tablecloth in Fruits of the Midi are suggested by the blending of blue, pink, and mauve, colors found in the still-life objects. Many of the fruits are set upon a platter of traditional design with blue decoration; the onions in turn are collected on a napkin with blue and red trim, while the tablecloth beneath contains yellow highlights that harmonize with the onion skins. Perhaps Renoir was thinking about how Onions and Fruits of the Midi might complement each other when he painted over the original blue, lavender, and mauve in the background of Fruits of the Midi (still visible at the edges of the painting; fig. 14.4) with lighter green and yellow.\n\nFinally, Onions and Fruits of the Midi exhibit a complementary compositional asymmetry. In Onions the main group of bulbs is gathered to the right, with a stray having fallen free of the group to the left. This grouping is mirrored in Fruits of the Midi, where the platter is placed off-center to the left, with a stray pomegranate and pepper to the right.\n\nFruits of the Midi was probably included in Renoir\u2019s retrospective exhibition of seventy works organized by Durand-Ruel in April 1883, along with Onions and the two views of the Bay of Naples. While there is no work titled Fruits du midi in the 1883 exhibition catalogue, critical commentary suggests that a still life resembling it was on display. The reviewer for the Journal des artistes wrote of a still life \u201cgathered together, in a jumble, gherkins and peppers in hard and garish colors\u201d\u2014likely mistaking the citrons in Fruits of the Midi for gherkins. These comments were immediately followed by a detailed description of and glowing praise for Onions. Such a disparate critical reaction to the two still lifes may shed light on why Onions was purchased by Durand-Ruel for 700 francs while the larger Fruits of the Midi garnered only 600 francs\u2014the brilliant colors used in the latter painting may have been too unsettling.\n\nIn reporting on his crisis of the 1880s to Ambroise Vollard, Renoir recalled that it was in 1883, the year of his retrospective exhibition, that he realized he had reached a dead end with Impressionism and \u201cdid not know how to paint or draw.\u201d Two years before that, however, when he set out for Italy in the fall of 1881, Renoir was undertaking a pilgrimage that, while a tradition for generations of French artists, was unusual for an Impressionist and may indicate that he was experiencing uncertainty about his artistic direction. In many letters written during the trip, Renoir conveyed self-consciousness about embarking on such a journey at the age of forty, well into the middle of his career. In one such missive to Madame Georges Charpentier from Venice in October, there is a subtext of wanting to fulfill expectations of new patrons about his artistic education: \u201cI have suddenly become a traveler, seized by the feverish desire to see the Raphaels. I am therefore in the process of taking in my Italy. Now I shall be able to reply firmly, yes, sir, I have seen the Raphaels. I have seen Venise la belle, etc., etc.\u201d As his travels through Italy progressed, Renoir reported that Raphael\u2019s frescoes were \u201cwonderful for simplicity and grandeur,\u201d and he was especially enthusiastic about his discovery of the archaeological museum in Naples and its collection of Roman mural painting.\n\nIt is tempting to see in the brushwork of Fruits of the Midi and in the solidity of its still-life elements the \u201cprogress\u201d that Renoir professed to have made after a long period of searching. A pronounced linear style is evident in how he modeled the still-life forms with a fine brush, following the contours with a pattern of crosshatching and layering to create highlights of pure color, for example, along the curving top of the red pepper in the foreground, just to the left of center (fig. 14.5). In other areas, he blended his colors to convincingly convey light falling on the surfaces of the objects. The varied textures in Fruits of the Midi establish the painting as a brilliantly conceived study in contrasts: the indented and buckled bodies of the peppers; the smooth, tight skins of the bright-red tomatoes; the yellow and green rind of the citron with its realistically nubby appearance. Renoir built up the glistening skin of the eggplant by layering deep translucent reds and blues over a foundation of brilliant mauves and bright reds (fig. 14.6). So carefully did Renoir model his fruits and vegetables within the initial drawing that radiotransparent \u201coutlines\u201d can be seen in the X-ray around the edges of the forms (fig. 14.7). While these still-life elements convey a sculptural presence, the background and tablecloth revert to an Impressionist style with longer strokes from a wider brush.\n\nFruits of the Midi may well have inspired the following comment by the American artist Marsden Hartley: \u201cI think of Renoir as a great painter of fruit. It always seems like the journey through the sensuous orchard of the aesthetic soul in Renoir. His flesh is eatable\u2014and his vistas and still lifes so strokable.\u201d It is revealing that Renoir\u2019s still life, the colors of which were found to be \u201cgarish\u201d in 1883, could inspire a modernist of a younger generation at the turn of the century. While Renoir\u2019s still lifes are often thought of as secondary compared to his figures and landscapes, Fruits of the Midi is clearly the result of careful consideration and amply demonstrates his mastery of color.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Using a standard-size canvas that he probably stretched and primed himself, Renoir began painting the still-life elements in this composition by outlining the major contours in very fluid, thin red paint. He established the still-life elements and largely finished them before adding the background. These forms are marked by their strong edges, both coloristically and sculpturally separated from their surroundings. In some areas, especially in the foreground, a small margin of unpainted ground is left around the objects, where the underdrawing is revealed. The ground itself appears to have been applied with a brush and then heavily worked into the canvas with a palette knife, leaving the thread tops exposed in many areas. The smaller, finer strokes used to build up the still-life elements contrast with the broader, longer diagonals and cross-hatched patterns in the background.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 14.8).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. 81. (lower left, in dark-blue paint) (fig. 14.9).\n\nThe signature was applied in very fluid paint over a dry, heavily textured background and primarily fills the depressions of the brushstrokes (fig. 14.10).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe primed area of the canvas is approximately 50 \u00d7 64 cm. This closely corresponds to a no. 15 landscape (paysage) standard-size (65 \u00d7 50 cm) canvas; this is also the number stamped on the verso of the stretcher (fig. 14.11).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.8V (0.7) \u00d7 23.0H (1.1) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas has very strong cusping on all sides, consistent with deformations seen when the canvas is stretched before the ground is applied.\n\nCurrent stretching: The work was lined and restretched at an unknown date, at which time the dimensions were increased slightly on all sides.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nThough the painting was lined and restretched as part of a previous, undocumented conservation treatment, the patina and standard size stamp suggest that the stretcher is original to the painting (fig. 14.12). It is a five-member, keyable, mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a vertical crossbar. Depth: 1.5 cm.\n\nStamp  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: black ovular stamp  \nContent: 15 w (fig. 14.11)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground was applied to the compositional area only after the canvas was stretched. It is a single layer with variable thickness ranging approximately 20\u201390 \u00b5m, partially fills the weave, and appears to have been heavily worked into the canvas with a palette knife, leaving the tops of the threads exposed in many areas. The edges are soft and uneven, suggesting that a brush was used to spread the ground after the initial application; the excess was likely removed and the layer smoothed with a palette knife. As the ground contains relatively few extenders and covers only the compositional area, it is possible that it was applied by the artist.\n\nThe ground is white; no additional, colored particles were observed under stereomicroscopic examination or cross-sectional analysis (fig. 14.13).\n\nThe ground is lead white with traces of alumina, complex silicates, and some calcium-based white. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nNo underdrawing is observed with infrared reflectography; however, careful stereomicroscopic examination suggests that Renoir may have outlined the major forms in very thin, fluid paint.\n\nEvidence of underdrawing is visible only microscopically along the edges of forms and suggests that the artist used a very thin red lake (fig. 14.14).\n\nAs the underdrawing is seen only along the edges of forms and is not seen in infrared reflectography, subsequent paint layers hide any possible changes in this stage of the composition (see Paint Layer).\n\nRenoir painted the still-life elements almost to completion before he brought the background in around them. Instead of blending the edges with the background and moving fluidly between the objects and their environment, Renoir gave each object an accentuated edge, in many cases using both color and texture to do so (fig. 14.15). In some areas, especially the foreground tablecloth and the rising stem in the center, the artist left a small margin of unpainted ground around the objects, increasing the sculptural nature of their edges (fig. 14.16). The light color of the tablecloth atop the white ground allowed these unpainted sections to visually blend with the surroundings. Even many of the smaller elements\u2014the various protruding stems and leaves\u2014appear to have been painted in large part before the background was added. This method of painting makes compositional changes more obvious, especially in the X-ray; these were limited to the possibility of a stem, leaves, or a fold in the tablecloth near the pomegranate on the far right; slight alterations to curve of the foreground eggplant near the stem; and the undersides of the peppers on the far right and to the left of center (fig. 14.17).\n\nThe still-life objects themselves were worked up in a series of paint layers, often incorporating vivid underpainting and wet-in-wet modeling. The appearance of certain objects under normal viewing conditions belies the intricacy of Renoir\u2019s working methods. Looking at the foreground eggplant and the pepper to its right, for example, specifically at the thin, glaze-like layers most evident on the surface, there is little visible information to explain the radio-opacity of these forms in the X-ray, where they appear to be the most heavily painted objects in the composition. The eggplant just left of center atop the pile of fruits appears as expected in the X-ray, indicating that it was probably painted primarily with the glaze-like layers most apparent in the foreground example. Closer inspection reveals that the latter was initially painted in mauves and reds, incorporating radio-opaque vermilion and lead white. These tones acted as an underlayer, over which Renoir applied thin layers of translucent pigments such as red lake and cobalt blue to partially expose the initial colors and give the vegetable\u2019s skin depth and coloristic complexity (fig. 14.18). Elsewhere, Renoir embraced a more heavy-handed approach, using a palette knife, as well as a brush, to spread thick paint containing opaque pigments across the surface, as in the somewhat bumpy surface of the citron in the center (fig. 14.19).\n\nThe background is marked by relatively long, directional brushstrokes, which contrast with the short, discrete strokes used in the still-life elements. Renoir changed the tonality of the background, first executing this space in an array of cool blue, lavender, and mauve tones that are still visible along the edges of forms and near the perimeter (fig. 14.20). Looking closely at the stem extending upward near the center, it is possible to see the back-and-forth between the objects and their surroundings: first, the initial paint layers of the stem were laid down, including a bright-yellow highlight; then the cool blue and lavender background colors were brought in around the stem; next the chunky white highlight was daubed atop the stem; and finally the new, greener background was applied (fig. 14.21). The tablecloth is largely made up of diagonal strokes of white, with hints of blue and red lake drawn in wet-in-wet to create soft shadows and folds. The vivid colors used in the still life are reflected in the muted tones of the broadly cross-hatched background.\n\nSoft and medium, round and flat brushes with strokes up to 1 cm wide; palette knife.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, emerald green, bone black, vermilion, red lake, iron oxide red and/or yellow, zinc yellow, cadmium yellow, and possibly Naples yellow and chrome yellow.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence under UV light indicates that Renoir used fluorescing red lake on some of the red and purple fruits, as well as in the underdrawing and limited portions of the background (fig. 14.22).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish was applied during the 1968 treatment and replaced an oil-resin varnish. There are residues of this earlier varnish around areas of impasto (especially the signature). In 1968, residues of an even older, more discolored resin varnish were noted; it is unclear whether this early varnish was original to the painting (see Conservation History).\n\nThe painting\u2019s first documented treatment occurred in 1967 and included consolidation of flaking paint and retouching. A more substantial treatment was undertaken the following year, and pretreatment notes indicate that the painting was already aqueously lined, with a natural-resin varnish and evidence of older, more discolored varnish in areas of impasto. As the work seemed in stable structural condition, this treatment was primarily aesthetic and included removal of grime and discolored varnishes. Losses were inpainted with methacrylate paints, and the painting was given a synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, inpainting, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe painting is in good condition, with a stable aqueous lining, and appears to retain its original stretcher. There are slight corner draws, but the work is well tensioned and otherwise planar. The canvas has discolored with age and saturation of the lining material, causing the tacking margins and exposed thread tops to appear much darker. Past cleaning and treatment have also exacerbated the abrasion and visibility of the thread tops in areas of exposed ground. There are a few local paint losses, and there is abrasion on the lower left. The stretcher was slightly keyed out and the perimeter expanded during the 1968 treatment; these edges have largely been retouched. This retouching is discolored but largely covered by the frame. The synthetic varnish imparts some saturation and an even gloss to the work and further saturates areas of exposed bare canvas.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (probably installed mid-1960s): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American (APF Master Frame Makers, New York), mid-twentieth-century, Louis XV reproduction, gilt scotia frame with swept, pointed sides; carved foliate ornament, foliate center cartouches, and foliate-and-acanthus corner cartouches; and a gilt fillet liner. The the frame has water and oil gilding over red bole on gesso, heavily rubbed and toned with a casein or gouache umber wash, gray overwash, and dark flecking. The high points of the ornament are particularly distressed. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished. The basswood molding is mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ovolo with leaf-tip outer molding; scotia side; scotia face with swept, pointed sides and carved foliate ornament, foliate center cartouches, and foliate-and-anthemion corner cartouches, quirked at the frieze; sanded front frieze; ogee sight molding with acanthus leaves on a recut bed; and an independent flat fillet liner with beveled sight edge (fig. 14.23).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933, removed mid-1960s): The painting was previously housed in a late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, ogee frame with alternating fleur-de-lis and pendent bellflower ornament bracketed by foliate scrolls and cabling and anthemion corner cartouches. The frame had water and oil gilding over gesso and cast plaster. The sides were burnished and the ornament was selectively burnished. The molding was mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was ovolo with leaf-tip ornament; scotia side; convex face with alternating fleur-de-lis and pendent bellflower ornament bracketed by foliate scrolls and cabling and anthemia corner cartouches; fillet; sanded frieze; ogee with leaf-tip-and-flower ornament; cove; and fillet with a cove sight edge (fig. 14.24).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Probably sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 23, 1882, for 600 francs.\n\nPossibly sold at Moore\u2019s Art Galleries, New York, May 6, 1887, lot 92.\n\nAcquired by Durand-Ruel, New York, by Nov. 14, 1908.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

As Midi was (and still is) the well-known designation for the south of France (and generally not associated with Italy), it is possible that this title was assigned to make the painting more marketable rather than to describe where it was painted. Some flexibility in the definition is provided in the Grande encyclop\u00e9die, which says midi can be a synonym for south; \u201cMidi,\u201d in La grande encyclop\u00e9die: Inventaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des lettres et des arts (H. Lamirault, 1885\u20131902), vol. 23, p. 951. Its use in the title may simply have been meant as a general description of a southerly climate. When the work appeared in the Durand-Ruel collection catalogue published in New York in 1887, it was given the title Fruits of the South; Catalogue of the Collection of French Paintings formed by M.

Cornichons, or gherkins, are a type of cucumber used for pickling.\n\nIn one of the three paragraphs Gilbert devoted to Onions, he recognized its innovative use of color: \u201cUne lumi\u00e8re chaude colore leur pelure mince et ils se d\u00e9tachent comme des fruits d\u2019or ros\u00e9 sur un fond bleu-p\u00e2le d\u2019une d\u00e9licatesse savante, comme un ruban bleu dans les cheveux d\u2019une blonde.\u201d Paul Gilbert, \u201cExposition de M. P.-A. Renoir,\u201d Journal des artistes 2, 15 (Apr. 13, 1883), p. 1. The proximity of the reviewer\u2019s discussion of the two still lifes may mean that they were hung near one another in the exhibition. In the catalogue, the painting titled L\u2019oignons is number 29, and Nature morte (Naples) is number 27. Another painting under the title Nature morte (no. 51) appeared in the 1883 catalogue, but it has never been identified.\n\n\u201cAchet\u00e9 \u00e0 M.

Mais je crois que j\u2019aurai fait des progr\u00e8s, ce qui arrive toujours apr\u00e8s de longues recherches.\u201d Renoir to Paul Durand-Ruel, Nov. 21, 1881, from Naples, in Barbara Ehrlich White, \u201cRenoir\u2019s Trip to Italy,\u201d Art Bulletin 51, 4 (Dec. 1969), p. 347, no. 3.\n\nHartley\u2019s comments are taken from a letter he wrote to Kenneth Hayes Miller, [late Jan.\u2013early Feb. 1920]; Kenneth Hayes Miller Papers, Archives of American Art, quoted in Bruce Weber, The Heart of the Matter: The Still Lifes of Marsden Hartley (Berry-Hill Galleries, New York, 2003), p. 15.\n\nIn many cases, the absence of ground on the tacking margins and uneven ground application are taken to indicate an artist-applied ground. Recent research has also suggested, however, that smaller-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single canvases. In this painting, the composition of the ground\u2014nearly pure lead white with almost no extenders\u2014suggests that the canvas was prepared by the artist. The trace elements found in the ground are so small in quantity that they are interpreted to be impurities in the lead white artists\u2019 paint rather than extenders commonly found in greater proportion in lead-based priming material used in traditional commercial preparation. See Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 68.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, indicates that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue; there may also be small amounts of red lake and other pigments.

Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Fruits of the Midi, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1881 (FruitsMidi/1933.1176),\u201d Mar. 2012.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in preparing a canvas. While this canvas was not commercially primed, it is unclear whether unprimed canvas sold to an artist or color merchant would have had a commercially applied sizing. A thinly applied sizing, whether applied by the artist or by the color merchant, could have been absorbed by the canvas and may not be visible under current circumstances. See Marc Vermeulen and Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1176\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 30, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe visual effect of the exposed thread tops throughout the ground has heightened as the canvas has darkened with age and the saturation of the lining material. Originally, the canvas would have been much closer in tone to the white ground. This effect is also exacerbated in areas of exposed ground as a result of repeated cleaning and treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nOften the absence of ground on the tacking margins and uneven ground application are taken to indicate an artist-applied ground. Anthea Callen wrote, \u201cRaw fabric on the edges of a canvas support show that the ground was applied after the canvas had been stretched. This is the norm for self-priming\u2014artists generally stretched the canvas and then primed only the surface to be painted.\u201d Recent research has also suggested that small-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single supports from rolls of unprimed canvas (see cat. 15, Chrysanthemums). In this painting, the composition of the ground\u2014nearly pure lead white with almost no extenders\u2014in addition to the lack of a color merchant\u2019s stamp on the verso of the canvas, suggests that the canvas was prepared by the artist.

The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.
