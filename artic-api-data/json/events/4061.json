    "description": "<p>The tiny village of Giverny hosted an informal circle of American artists. From the mid-1880s until the outbreak of the First World War, young artists who studied in Paris regularly made the journey out of the capital to summer in the village. They were drawn to the region for its quiet life, picturesque landscapes, and a low price of living. But more than that they came to Giverny with hopes to encounter Claude Monet. Only a few were allowed in the master\u2019s garden but they all felt his influence. This talk will explore what they learned beyond the garden\u2019s gate.</p><p> <strong>Location: </strong>Carlisle Banquets at 435 E Butterfield Road, Lombard, IL 60148</p><p><strong>Program Capacity: </strong>200</p><p><strong>Registration period: </strong>Wednesday, September 19, 2018\u2013Tuesday, October 9, 2018</p><p><strong>Schedule of the Day: </strong></p><p>11:30 Social time (cash bar available)</p><p>12:00 Luncheon</p><p>1:15 Meeting</p><p>1:30 Lecture</p><p>Lunch menu options: Salad Trio or Chicken Brochette Oriental </p><p>To reach the event planner, please contact Sue Krause at (630) 678-0484, (630) 272-5484, or email sue.krause412@gmail.com.  </p><p>To reach the assistant event planner, please contact Cheryl Groth at (630) 363-0947 or email dwightgroth@sbcglobal.net.</p><p>Accessibility and Dietary Concerns:<br>Community Associates tries to make their events accessible to members.
