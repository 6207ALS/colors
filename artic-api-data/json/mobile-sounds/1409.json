    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The Buddha meditates serene and smiling. The lotus flower which emerges pure white from impure mud is an essential Buddhist symbol. You can see one incised in the palm of his right hand. The Buddha sits on the powerful coils of the many-headed serpent king Mucalinda whose hoods form a halo.</p>\n<p>TANYA TREPTOW:  After the Buddha\u2019s enlightenment he mediated over a period of several weeks and during this time there is a very violent thunderstorm and the serpent king Mucalinda came and sheltered the Buddha with his hoods so that he would be able to meditate.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Tanya Treptow, research assistant in the areas of southeast Asian, Indian and Islamic art.</p>\n<p>TANYA TREPTOW: This figure represents a form that was vastly popular during the Khmer Empire.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The extensive Khmer Empire centered in today\u2019s Cambodia was near the end of a long period of prosperity in the thirteenth century when this sculpture was made. In this period, Khmer kings officially adopted Buddhism and sponsored many new temples and sculptures. You can follow Buddhism\u2019s journey from India to Cambodia in this sculpture. For example, the usually unadorned Buddha here where\u2019s the crown of a Khmer prince. It may be that the patron of this kingly sculpture wished to suggest the Buddha\u2019s approval of the Khmer dynasty.</p>\n",
