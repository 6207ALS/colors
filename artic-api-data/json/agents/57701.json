    "description": "<p>Robert A. \u201cBobby\u201d Sengstacke spent more than a half century photographing Chicago\u2019s cultural and political landscape, most notably for the weekly newspaper the <em>Chicago Defender</em>, for which he also worked as an editor. The <em>Defender</em> was founded by Robert\u2019s great-uncle Robert Sengstacke Abbott in 1905, and Robert\u2019s father, John Sengstacke, ran the paper for nearly 60 years. In the mid-1950s, after attending Florida\u2019s Bethune Cookman College, Bobby Sengstacke returned to Chicago and honed his skills with fellow photographers <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/44240/billy-abernathy\" target=\"_blank\">Billy Abernathy</a>, Le Mont Mac Lemore, and Bob Black. In the years that followed, he became a member of a tight-knit network of South Side photojournalists who created intimate documents of Chicago\u2019s black community, from Civil Rights rallies led by Martin Luther King Jr. to the city\u2019s lively entertainment scene.</p><p>Sengstacke was also a founding member of the Organization of Black American Culture (OBAC), which brought together black artists, writers, intellectuals, and activists on Chicago\u2019s South Side. In 1967, OBAC conceived its first collaborative public artwork\u2014the <em>Wall of Respect</em>, an outdoor mural located at 43rd Street and Langley Avenue in the city\u2019s Bronzeville neighborhood. The mural, created by 21 artists, featured black heroes and heroines grouped in seven sections. Sengstacke contributed two photographs to the religious section: <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/241247/savior-s-day-prayer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Saviours\u2019 Day Prayer</em></a> (at the time known as <em>Spiritual Grace</em>) and <em>Girls in Church</em>. In addition to his contributions to the <em>Wall</em>, Sengstacke\u2019s photographs of the mural and its creation remain the most widely published and circulated documentation of the site, which was destroyed in 1971.</p>",
