However, on the basis of its stylistic and technical similarities to The Dancing Girl (cat. 29), this image should probably be dated to 1889, together with three other, similar lithographs of nude or lightly draped females (cat. 31, cat. 32, and cat. 33). The Horoscope, The Dancing Girl, and Model Draping (cat. 31) were drawn on the same type of coarse-grained transfer paper and appear to depict the same young model. They also share a similar handling of the crayon: delicate, curvilinear strokes suggest the movement of the model\u2019s gown, while light, economical hatching defines the contours of the body beneath its transparent drapery. Further evidence that the three lithographs were drawn at about the same time is provided by T. R. Way, who discussed them together in his memoir of 1912. According to Way\u2019s account, Whistler was dissatisfied with The Horoscope and instructed the Ways to erase it from the stone along with the transfers of The Dancing Girl and Model Draping. The artist\u2019s request was not carried out, however. In 1892, when he saw them again, his opinion of the images had changed and he was pleased to discover that they had not been erased. Nevertheless, in February 1893, when the editor Gleeson White expressed a desire to publish The Horoscope in The Studio, Whistler refused, describing the lithograph as \u201ca very early and [bungling] struggle with the difficulties of a new material.\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC, cream Japanese paper (311 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (254 \u00d7 197 mm), signed; Palmer, grayish ivory laid proofing paper (289 \u00d7 205 mm).
