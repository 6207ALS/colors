The McMullan Family Foundation Summer Intensive The McMullan Family Foundation Summer Intensive is a weeklong program exposing undergraduate students to museum professions through workshops, behind-the-scenes tours, field trips, and networking events. The 2023 program returns to the theme of \u201cThe Museum Space,\u201d which considers the museum\u2019s relationship to real and imagined environments, both within and outside of its physical footprint. This year\u2019s iteration puts particular emphasis on collaboration, networks, and community, while engaging with exhibitions on view featuring artists such as Gio Swaby, Kwame Brathwaite, Peter Hujar, Lui Shou-Kwan, Van Gogh, and more. This year\u2019s program will run June 12\u201317, 2023. Students who complete the summer intensive are eligible to apply for a two-year fellowship at the museum, a part-time opportunity to pursue alongside their academic programs.   The McMullan Family Foundation Summer Intensive and the McMullan Arts Leadership Initiative are supported by the James and Madeleine McMullan Family Foundation. ",
