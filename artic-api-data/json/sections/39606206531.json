In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio, at 6 rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 60.1, fig. 60.2, and fig. 60.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see cat. 60.1) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nIn the case of this, the tenth and last plate in the Noa Noa Suite of wood-block prints (cat. 60.1, cat. 60.2, cat. 60.3, and cat. 60.4), Gauguin reprised the theme of his 1892 painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 60.4 left [W 457]). The canvas depicts the artist\u2019s young mistress, Tehura, as he claimed to have found her one night, terrified by the spirit of death (tupapau), which she believed to be lurking nearby. In the painting, the tupapau appears as a hooded figure in profile behind the girl at the left. Because the image in the print has been reversed by the printing process, the spirit appears in the image\u2019s shadowy background at the right. The most significant difference between the painting and print is the recumbent female. Instead of a nude lying on her stomach across a bed and gazing at the viewer, we see in the print the backside of the woman, who is curled into a fetal position. With her legs pulled close and her right arm lying along her body, she lifts her left hand, clenched in a fist, to cover her eyes. She is surrounded by a brilliant oval of light, as if illuminated by spotlight on a stage. In the painting, the bedsheet and pillow have a similar function. Given Gauguin\u2019s deep admiration for the sculptor Auguste Rodin (see also cat. 58), it is possible that, in composing the reclining figure in the painting, he was thinking of the expressive power of the similarly positioned woman in the sculptor\u2019s Misery (fig. 60.5), which Gauguin could have seen at the Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, in 1889. This landmark exhibition, shared with Claude Monet, established Rodin as the leading sculptor of his generation. Another element not present in the painting is the evocation of a tiki, or idol, based on Marquesan woodcarvings, at the upper left, above the title Manao tupapau. The tiki occupies the same position in the print as a scallop-like shape in the painting that appears not to have any relationship to the form of an idol but rather may indicate a headboard.\n\nFrom the painting, in addition to the hooded tupapau in profile, Gauguin repeated the decorated post\u2014also informed by Marquesan designs\u2014against which the spirit leans (fig. 60.4); one of the flowers that decorate the colored fabric emerging from under the sheets; and the spark-like bursts above the nude. Gauguin called the latter \u201cphosphoresences\u201d and \u201cflowers of Tupapau.\u201d They resemble hutu blossoms, which in fact bloom at night (see fig. 60.6). In the painting, the tupapau extends one hand to hold the stem of the flowering vine, which meanders across the composition from left to right. In the Noa Noa print, the tupapau\u2019s hand has not been fully articulated.\n\nAfter he completed the tenth plate of his Noa Noa suite, Gauguin embarked on a wood-block print in which he expanded the manao tupapau theme by placing the woman in a fetal position in a bucolic landscape (fig. 60.7 [Kornfeld 30 I] and fig. 60.8 top). Using the verso of the board he had employed for this print, he returned to the subject and composition of the 1892 oil Manao tupapau, rendering a close-up view\u2014head, neck, upper back, and hands\u2014of the frightened woman that corresponds closely to the figure in the painting (fig. 60.9 [cat. 78.1] and fig. 60.8 bottom [Kornfeld 30]). The tupapau, again in profile, is positioned directly behind the nude, close to the pillow on which her head rests. The compression of the originally horizontal composition into a vertical one, eliminating as it does the full figure of the female and the entire bed, intensifies the sense of fear in the image.\n\nGauguin inserted the motif of a female nude in a fetal position into several different contexts. She is the central focus of his largest wood-block print, also titled She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her, from 1894 (fig. 60.10 [cat. 77.3]). At some point, Gauguin took an impression of this large print, cut out the landscape, and pasted the remnant with the nude on the black sand on page 75 (folio 42R) of his 1893\u20131901 bound manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 60.11 [Kornfeld 29 I b]).\n\nIn other works, Gauguin played with the woman by turning her to face the viewer. Two 1894 watercolor transfer monotypes show her, her eyes open and resting on one arm, while the other arm covers her breasts (fig. 60.12 [Field 1973 14] and fig. 60.13 [Field 1973 15]). That same year, Gauguin included two nudes in a fetal position, one seen from the front and the other from the back, in his painting Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (fig. 60.14 [cat. 72]). The two watercolor monotypes and Mahana no atua echo Rodin\u2019s Misery. Gauguin repeated the canvas\u2019s composition in a later wood-block print (fig. 60.15 [cat. 80.1).\n\nTurning now to the motif of a hooded tupapau in profile, it made its first appearance in Gauguin\u2019s oeuvre in the 1892\u201393 painting Still Life with Flowers and Idol (fig. 60.16 [W 494]), in which the yellow-eyed spirit hovers behind a bouquet of bougainvillea and taro leaves and clasps a pua blossom. The earliest appearance of the motif of the tupapau in profile is found in a to-scale preparatory drawing of the Tahitian Eve from 1892 pricked for transfer to a painting from that year, Parau ne te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 60.17 [W 458]). The artist pasted a photograph of this drawing onto page 51 (folio 28R) of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 60.18). Here the shadowy specter seems to hover behind Eve. In the finished painting, Gauguin turned the tupapau to face the viewer directly. Later, after the drawing had served its purpose as a cartoon, Gauguin dramatically heightened it with pastel and, in so doing, gave the tupapau a more prominent and menacing presence (fig. 60.19 [Pickvance X]). Gauguin executed another image of Eve accompanied by the tupapau in profile, which he intended to use as an illustration of Parau ne te varua ino in the commercial edition of Noa Noa (fig. 60.20).\n\nA reduced watercolor version of the painting Manao tupapau appears as illustration accompanying text in Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline) (fig. 60.21 [Rewald 67]), the manuscript the artist wrote for his daughter in the spring of 1893.\n\nThe motif\u2014almost undetectable, so faint is the rendering\u2014is found in the background of an 1894 sketch of the Tahitian gods Hina and Tefatu on a beach (fig. 60.22). The way the composition is framed suggests that it was an idea for either a painting or an illustration. Also from that year is a black-and-white lithograph (fig. 60.23 left [Kornfeld 23 B]), a reduced but embellished version of the oil Manao tupapau; Gauguin reinforced the nocturnal presence of supernatural beings by adding Hina, in the traditional position of outstretched arms, and, above the tupapau, the profile of a varua, a malevolent spirit (fig. 60.23 right). Gauguin contributed this print to the April\u2013June 1894 issue of the quarterly publication L\u2019estampe originale.\n\nThe hooded tupapau in profile features prominently in a carved oak panel that is part of an 1894 decorative ensemble entitled Pape moe (Mysterious Waters) (fig. 60.24 [Gray 107]). In a watercolor on silk from the same year entitled Musique barbare (Barbaric Music) (fig. 60.25 [Pickvance XVI]), a maniacal-looking tupapau, in the company of other Polynesian deities and spirits, plays on a keyboard, with one hand on the instrument and the other, raised in an exaggerated manner, poised to pound down on it.\n\nGauguin continued to revisit favorite themes and motifs, including the tupapau, during his second sojourn in Tahiti (1895\u20131901) and then in the Marquesas (1901\u20133). For example, in a wood-block print that is part of a suite of prints featuring such images, Eve appears alongside a tupapau in profile (fig. 60.26 [Kornfeld 42]). The pair is found again The Nightmare, a powerful traced and transferred drawing executed in printer\u2019s ink from 1899/1900 (fig. 60.27 [Field 1973 70]). Here the tupapau is depicted in full figure on horseback; the deep shadows, cave-like formation, coiled snake, and a falling man at the right contribute to the image\u2019s menacing quality. The Nightmare was inspired by Albrecht D\u00fcrer\u2019s 1513 engraving Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), of which Gauguin owned a facsimile reproduction. He eventually pasted the reproduction onto the back cover of his 1903 manuscript Avant et apr\u00e8s (Before and After) (fig. 60.28). Gauguin explored the theme of an equestrian tupapau in various paintings, watercolors, gouache transfer monotypes, and traced and transferred printing-ink drawings (see fig. 60.29 [W 597], fig. 60.30 [Rewald 108, fig. 60.31 [Pickvance 102], and fig. 60.32 [Field 1973 134]). The ghoulish, hooded tupapau in profile made its final appearance in a pen-and-ink illustration captioned A quoi penser tu? Je ne sais pas (What Are You Thinking Of? I Don\u2019t Know) on page 103 of Avant et apr\u00e8s (fig. 60.33 [Pickvance 113]).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The 1892 painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 60.34) was one of the works realized by Gauguin during his first stay in Tahiti that the artist valued most. He sent it to three exhibitions in 1893\u201394, asking a high price for it, and he gave an ambitious account of its genesis modeled after Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Philosophy of Composition.\u201d It is therefore logical that he included a reference to it in Noa Noa, the fictionalized account of his stay on the island, and a version of it in the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nIn the Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline) (fig. 60.35), Gauguin explained that his title has two senses: \u201cEither she thinks of the ghost / Or the ghost thinks of her.\u201d Mana\u2018o means \u201cthought, idea, meaning, conception\u201d when used substantively and \u201cto think, muse, reflect\u201d when used verbally; t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018udesignates \u201ca ghost, or apparition, the supposed spirit of the dead.\u201d In the absence of any further precision, and when one supplies the implicit term for the recumbent woman, the title indeed becomes a syntactic palindrome, which can be translated as Gauguin proposed, thereby creating an ontological reversibility between the woman and the ghost. Whereas in Vision of the Sermon (Jacob Wrestling with the Angel) (fig. 60.36 [W 245]), as Gauguin explained to Vincent van Gogh, the landscape with Jacob and the Angel exists \u201conly in the imagination of the praying people,\u201d in Manao tupapau the woman may as well exist \u201conly in the mind of the ghost.\u201d The artist summarized this symmetrical situation as follows: \u201cThe spirit of a living [woman] connected with the spirit of the dead. Night and day.\u201d\n\nIn Noa Noa, the description of Manao tupapau is preceded and justified by a story: coming back from Papeete in the heart of night, the narrator finds his mistress Tehura (Teha\u2018amana) lying awake and terrified on their bed, as the oil lamp has gone out. In the late nineteenth century, \u201cterror of the dark\u201d was mentioned as a typical characteristic of Polynesians and interpreted as a residue of their ancient worldview. Pierre Loti (Julien Viaud) wrote in his 1878 novel, Le mariage de Loti: \u201cThe solitude of the woods and darkness terrify them; they people the wilderness with ghosts and spirits.\u201d He also said that pronouncing the \u201cuncanny, terrifying and untranslatable\u201d word t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u was enough to prompt a party of young girls bathing in the moonlight (see cat. 59, Commentary) to flee \u201clike crazy creatures,\u201d and described the body of his lover Rarahu\u2019s old father, just deceased, as mummy-like and embodying \u201cthe ideal image\u201d of the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u.\n\nSurprisingly, the wood-block print of the Noa Noa Suite entitled Manao tupapau departs from the composition of the eponymous painting in its depiction of the visually most important protagonist, the recumbent woman: instead of lying on her stomach and directing her gaze toward the spectator, she shows her back and curls into a fetal position, her left hand clenched in a fist that covers her face. This closed posture derives from that of the Peruvian mummy in the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Ethnographie du Trocad\u00e9ro (fig. 60.37), which Gauguin had been using as a model to symbolize the negation of life, in contrast to the open, risk-taking one of the young woman throwing herself into the waves present in a number of his works in various media (see cat. 59, Commentary). To that extent, the fetal position is connected to death and to the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u. But it also suggests birth or rebirth, and in the print the oval of light into which Gauguin turned the bedding can evoke a giant placenta. This semantic ambivalence is made explicit by a doubling of the figure in Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (fig. 60.38 [cat. 72]), which Gauguin painted in France in 1894: the curled-up female turning her back to the pool in the foreground answers another woman, with open eyes and slightly extended legs, facing the water and touching it with her feet. In the Manao tupapau print, the dark and threatening area surrounding the oval of light makes the latter appear as a refuge, in which the mummy/fetus position should provide protection.\n\nThe background of the print unfolds like a frieze above the curled figure. From right to left\u2014the left-to-right order in the painting is reversed by the printing process\u2014we see an ornamented post, the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u, three luminous flowers, and a curving, decorative band under which the title is inscribed. Pola Gauguin\u2019s impression of the block (see fig. 60.39) and the corresponding part of the painting (fig. 60.40) help to identify the print\u2019s constituting elements.\n\nThe decorated post was inspired by the tiki-shaped pillars supporting the roof in Polynesian funerary or ceremonial houses (see fig. 60.41) and representing the ancestors of the community. It thus introduces a traditional and mythical dimension, while indicating that the scene is taking place indoors. The decoration of this post includes a pair of concentric circles suggesting eyes, which derive from Marquesan ornament and can be compared with the mask-like motif that Gauguin used to represent the face of the creator god Ta\u2018aroa, for example, in his 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (fig. 60.42). The fact that the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u leans against this post and that the woman\u2019s foot encroaches on the ghost\u2019s shape suggests a vertical continuity between the living, the dead, the ancestors, and the original genesis. In his comments on the painting, Gauguin wrote that he represented the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u as an ordinary woman because the young Tahitian\u2019s conception of the dead was untouched by \u201cthe theater of French spiritualists,\u201d and he explained that the ghost extends the hand \u201cas if to seize a prey.\u201d As a matter of fact, the specter rather seems to hold one of the flowers, a gesture that is hardly legible in the print. In general Gauguin\u2019s impressions do not provide the level of detail found in those of Pola, revealing how different their respective goals were. Extremely varied, Gauguin\u2019s impressions can be compared to various interpretations of a musical score. In one of these, obtained by printing the block three times\u2014in black, brown, and gray (cat. 60.2)\u2014the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u is emphasized, with its luminous eye and mouth and brooding, sphinx-like presence. In another (cat. 60.3), the outline of the ghost and of the pillar disappear, and the dark ground is interrupted by enigmatic flashes of light. As for the body of the reclining woman, although Gauguin took great pains to define the texture and three-dimensionality of her form on the wood block using a needle and later a burin (fig. 60.43), he finally resorted to wiping and \u201ctwilling\u201d (applying a fabric to the inked block) to imbue her with a softer, more sensuous and \u201cpainterly\u201d appearance (fig. 60.44).\n\nSeveral authors, including Peter Zegers, have compared the flowers in the background to those of the hutu, a tree whose fruit is used to catch fish by poisoning them (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 60.6). Gauguin wrote that they were \u201cflowers of t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u, phosphorescences, a sign that the ghost takes care of you,\u201d and he situated them ontologically in the woman\u2019s mind: \u201cThere are some flowers in the background but they mustn\u2019t be real because they\u2019re imaginary, I make them look like sparks.\u201d In terms of the location of the flowers/sparks in the composition, their effect is paradoxical, since they dissolve the boundaries of the house to let in the Tahitian night while at the same time exteriorizing what is going on in Teha\u2018amana\u2019s mind. This is more easily and completely achieved in the print, where the architectural indications are minimal and the young woman\u2019s gaze, provided her eyes are open as in the painting, is directed toward the background.\n\nGauguin had already produced a similar effect in two images of his children asleep, painted in 1881 and 1884. In The Little One Is Dreaming (fig. 60.45 [W 52]), his daughter, Aline, then nearly four, is shown sleeping with her back to the spectator, turned toward a wall decorated above the dado rail with silhouettes of birds and leaves too irregular to represent wallpaper. The analogies with Manao tupapau\u2014both painting and print\u2014are numerous; one is even tempted to relate to the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u the bearded puppet in a red coat hanging from the girl\u2019s iron bed. The second painting, Clovis Asleep (fig. 60.46 [W 81, W 2000 151]), shows Gauguin\u2019s second son at around five years of age, sleeping near a Norwegian wooden beer mug and beneath an expanse of blue on which bird and plant motifs are again to be seen, this time light on dark. Since Gauguin made no attempt at depicting realistic surroundings in either painting, it becomes clear that he intended the motifs to suggest the oneiric visions experienced by the children. By this time, psychological research on dreams was very popular in France, and Gauguin may have wished to represent so-called \u201chypnagogic hallucinations,\u201d mental images perceived in a state between waking and sleeping, which the oneirologist Marie Jean L\u00e9on d\u2019Hervey de Saint-Denys described as luminous and dynamic apparitions (see fig. 60.47).\n\nThe plant or insect motif with two round leaves/wings and a spark-like \u201cflower\u201d hovering immediately above the child\u2019s head in Clovis Asleep can claim a true progeny in the flowers on stems in Manao tupapau. Alfred Jarry, staying at the same time as Gauguin at the Pension Gloanec in Pont-Aven, Brittany, in the summer of 1894, wrote a poem inspired by Manao tupapau that begins: \u201cThe wall is already going to sleep.\u201d There are good reasons, therefore, to think that the upper part of Manao tupapau represents Teha\u2018amana\u2019s dream. But \u201cdream\u201d should not be understood in the limited sense of visions occurring to an individual in her sleep: in the painting, the woman is awake, and Gauguin explained his choice of imagery by reference to \u201cTahitian beliefs.\u201d In the wood-block print, he replaced the curvilinear motif above the woman\u2019s head with an undulating band carrying a Marquesan-type face (fig. 60.48). In a lithographic version of his composition (fig. 60.49; see cat. 73, Commentary), he added on the left a complex ornamental motif and on the right the face of the earth god, Tefatu, and the standing figure of the moon goddess, Hina (see cat. 53, Commentary). These additions, which complement the \u201cspirit of the dead\u201d and the allusion to the creator god on the decorated post make it clear that Teha\u2018amana\u2019s dream has a mythographic dimension and expresses a collective \u201cthought\u201d or \u201cbelief.\u201d The background of Manao tupapau can also be compared with that of a portrait of Gauguin\u2019s lover that he painted before leaving Tahiti and entitled Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana) (fig. 60.50 [cat. 50]). The mysterious Easter Island glyphs; images of Hina, Tefatu, and a t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u or v\u0101rua \u2018ino; and the ceremonial fan Teha\u2018amana holds proudly all proclaim that, despite the \u201cmissionary dress\u201d imposed by the colonists, she must be situated within this pan-Oceanic ancestral context and can trace her genealogy to the Polynesian deities.\n\nThere remains a certain ambiguity\u2014or ambivalence\u2014about the relationship between the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u and Teha\u2018amana. Expressions such as \u201cthe ghost watches over her\u201d or \u201cthe ghost takes care of you\u201d suggest a benevolent attitude, but the young woman experiences fear, even terror, emotions that appear justified by the eerie atmosphere and the notion that the \u201cspirit of the dead\u201d extends its hand \u201cas if to seize a prey.\u201d The hypothesis of a predatory t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u is supported by a Western source upon which Gauguin drew for Manao tupapau, Henry Fuseli\u2019s \u201cgothic\u201d painting The Nightmare (fig. 60.51), which shows a female sleeper dominated by an incubus, a demon believed to descend upon women in their sleep and seek carnal intercourse with them. Jarry used the term in his poem and imagined Teha\u2018amana \u201cdreaming of old mysteries: / on solitary nights / the souls of the sleeping dead / came back to life as lovers.\u201d In his contributions to Noa Noa, Charles Morice imagined the recumbent woman as a sexual prey for the t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018us and connected the painting with other Tahitian works by Gauguin, such as Parahi te marae (The Sacred Mountain) (fig. 60.52 [W 483]) to propose a broader narrative (see fig. 60.53): having deserted their temples and deprived their gods of human sacrifices, the Tahitians were punished with sterility, until the gods elected T\u00e9hura (Teha\u2018amana) to be impregnated \u201cso that the Judge and King, Taora, / Sit again on the egg of eternal mystery, / So that the Father and the God, Taora, / Share the earth to greater than Man.\u201d\n\nWe do not know to what extent this overarching interpretation was based on information and ideas exchanged between Morice and Gauguin, but the artist included it in his Louvre manuscript of Noa Noa, so that some measure of agreement must be assumed. The mummy/fetus position chosen by Gauguin for the wood-block print version of Manao tupapau, with its simultaneous evocation of death and rebirth, fits the quasi-alchemical incubation of \u201cthe egg of eternal mystery.\u201d But no wood-block print based on Parahi te marae is included in the Noa Noa Suite, and if any allusion to human sacrifices or to their discontinuation is to be found there, then it is present only in the most indirect fashion (see cat. 55, Commentary). For Douglas Druick and Zegers, Manao tupapau is the closing plate of the suite (see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d). In this hypothetical order, Manao tupapau points back to Te po (The Night) (fig. 60.54 [cat. 52.2])\u2014the print immediately following the title page\u2014which also shows a recumbent woman surrounded by otherworldly and ominous figures, although the scene\u2019s darkness is relieved by a burning lamp. Yet despite the fact that Teha\u2018amana\u2019s lamp has gone out\u2014according to the Noa Noa story\u2014and that she lies in complete obscurity, Manao tupapau is more luminous than Te po, or rather it juxtaposes a more clearly lit area, inhabited by a dark body, with an unlit one, animated by \u201cphosphorescence.\u201d This dynamic opposition, spectacularly exploited by Louis Roy\u2019s impressions with the help of stencils and various colors (see fig. 60.55 [Kornfeld 20, 14, D] and fig. 60.56 [Kornfeld 20]), corresponds to Gauguin\u2019s understanding of the dialects of ao (\u201cday\u201d) and p\u014d (\u201cnight\u201d) and more generally of the \u201cPolynesian dualism\u201d (see cat. 52, Commentary). It is also an appropriate conclusion to a work that changed the course of printmaking, in black and white and in colors.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

En haut de l\u2019escalier, \u00e0 la hauteur de second, un balcon desservait trois ateliers. Le troisi\u00e8me et dernier de ceux-ci, au bout de balcon, \u00e9tait celui de Gauguin. . . .

At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . .

Colta Ives identified the man at the lower left of figure 59.2 as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Museum/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten woodblock prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends).

Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the woodcuts do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.
