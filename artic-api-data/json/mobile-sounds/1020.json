    "transcript": "<p>KATE NESIN: This \u201cWoman with Dog\u201d from 2004 is a surreal, frankly, almost absurd figure. She\u2019s hugely exaggerated in scale.  She and her dog are clearly based on such a souvenir figurine one might buy at a seaside gift shop.  She\u2019s been exploded in scaleto roughly human scale.  Not only that, but given this really, at once gorgeously, lushly pink color and a kind of sickeningly pink color, it\u2019s a bit of a Pepto-Bismol pink, which is, beautifully vivid, especially at a distance, to walk towards this figure.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: German artist Katharina Frisch draws her source material from a childhood fascination with folklore and fairy tales, often transforming familiar shapes into something otherworldly.  She purposefully uses bold, sometimes unsettling, colors.</p>\n<p>KATE NESIN: She really does feel impassioned about returning color to sculpture, even when it\u2019s a strange or, off-putting color, that that vividness is as important as potentially, emotionally, psychologically impactful, for viewers as a more seductive or enticing color.</p>\n<p>She has said, in particular, that, color seemed to be, \u201c\u2026 too childish, too sensual, too emotional,\u201d are her words.  And those are all things that I think she really wants to inject back into her work, and so much of her work does come out of childhood engagement and childhood memories, and evokes that for us as well.</p>\n",
