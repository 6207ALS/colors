    "description": "<p>Trained as a cabinet-maker in Paris, Charles-Honor\u00e9 Lannuier arrived in New York in 1803 at the age of twenty-four. His older brother was already well established as the owner of a successful confectionary shop on Broadway and from there the young furniture maker first advertised his services to all potential clients who desired furniture in the \u201clatest French fashion.\u201d Early-nineteenth-century America was much enamored with French taste, and Lannuier successfully catered to his upscale clientele, tempering his designs to suit their preference even while he retained a distinctive French flair. One of a group of similar card tables, this example shares many of their decorative and design elements, including a winged caryatid central support, a Lannuier trademark.</p>\n",
