    "description": "<p>Self-study is a practice of looking at and into oneself. Join Robin Schnur to explore works of art that were created through the process of self-examination and depict a likeness, document an internal state, or perform an aspect of identity. During this gallery talk we'll also experiment with mindful practices of self-study that can be integrated into everyday life. </p><p>Please note that the topic of this gallery talk has changed from what was originally listed in the summer Public Programs brochure.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
