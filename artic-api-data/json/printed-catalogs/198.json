    "copy": " Bisa Butler (American, b. 1973) creates vibrant, psychologically nuanced portraits composed entirely of colored and patterned fabrics that she cuts, layers, and stitches together. Often depicting scenes from African American life and history, Butler invites viewers to invest in the lives of the people she represents while simultaneously expanding art-historical narratives about American quiltmaking. A group of scholars\u2014and the artist herself\u2014situate Butler's interdisciplinary work within the broader history of textiles, photography, and contemporary art, illuminating the artist's approach to color, use of African-print fabrics, and wide-ranging sources of inspiration. An in-depth exploration of one of America\u2019s most innovative contemporary artists, this volume will serve as a primary resource that both introduces Butler\u2019s work and establishes a scholarly foundation for future research.   Edited by Erica Warren With contributions by Bisa Butler, Jordan Carter, Isabella Ko, Erica Warren, and Michele Wije   104 pages, 8 \u00d7 12 in. 39 color + 5 b/w ills.
