    "description": "<p>Chicago-based contemporary music group Ensemble Dal Niente present the record release concert of <em>Assemblage</em>, a collaboration with composer George Lewis. </p><p>The recording project marks the first-ever album solely devoted to the notated compositions of Lewis, who is renowned for his boundary crossing work as a trombonist, improvisor, computer musician, scholar and multimedia artist.</p><p>Of <em>Assemblage</em>, Lewis says: \u201cboth the title and the content of Assemblage refer to a type of visual artmaking that recombines and recontexualizes collections of natural and human-made objects. Assemblage-like processes were deployed in the early twentieth century works of Marcel Duchamp, Picasso, Louise Nevelson, and later, Jean Dubuffet\u2026 Artists active in the 1960s and after, including Noah Purifoy, Betye Saar, John Outterbridge, and David Hammons, adopted and extended the assemblage process, recycling and reframing both the quotidian urban detritus of modern civilization and the products of the human body as a means of establishing a historically synchronic creation of an African imaginary in African American.\u201d</p><p>George Lewis\u2019s works are constructed with an assortment of energetic sonic materials that are constantly recontextualized by juxtapositions and repetitions. The music encourages the listener to be an active participant in the unfolding context of the sounds, to concatenate their own experience, to be what the composer calls \u201cimprovisative listeners.\u201d</p><p>George Lewis leads a pre-concert talk on <em>Assemblage</em>.</p><p>*Ticketholders for this event may enter the museum with their event ticket beginning at 2:30.
