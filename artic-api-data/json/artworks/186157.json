The process is repeated each afternoon as part of the daily rituals of farming life at Camphill Village. Elias is one of roughly 240 adults who live in small extended-family households in this six-hundred-acre community of farmland, gardens and forests. Some of these residents are villagers (people with developmental disabilities) and some are volunteers (co-workers and their children). Collectively, the village and its inhabitants are the living realization of the vision of the Austrian pediatrician Dr. Karl K\u00f6nig and the philosophy of the Austrian scientist and educator Rudolf Steiner.\n\nSteiner\u2019s ideas defy simple description, but when he founded the Anthroposophical Society in 1924, he dedicated it to people everywhere who wanted to \u201cfoster the life of the soul, both in the individual and in human society on the basis of a true knowledge of the spiritual world.\u201d The Camphill Village movement (there are ten communities in the US and a hundred worldwide) is based upon providing a fully integrated environment, where people of all ages and abilities share home, work and social activities.\n\n\u201cSocial therapy,\u201d the continual creation of a healing social and physical environment, also plays a part. Like the Japanese Nobel laureate in literature Kenzaburo Oe, who wrote about what he learned from his mentally disabled son, adherents of this therapy point out that people with special needs are themselves teachers and care givers.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean,\u201d Camphill Village asks in its literature, \u201cto recognize the spiritual integrity and unique destiny of each individual?\u201d As Elias walks down the road with purpose on a summer afternoon, an answer comes to mind.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
