This custom was recounted by Edmond de Goncourt in his novel Les fr\u00e8res Zemganno, published in 1879, in which a child gymnast, age five, receives a similar ovation. Until Angelina\u2019s reminiscences became known, the girls\u2019 identities had long been forgotten; indeed, they appear to have been irrelevant to Renoir when he described the work in the early twentieth century to the art dealer Ambroise Vollard as \u201cdes fillettes jouaient avec des oranges.\u201d The models may simply have represented for Renoir a generalized subject of leisure entertainment in the Third Republic. Throughout the nineteenth century, clowns and acrobats brought distraction and momentary joy to Parisian audiences. During the 1870s, the Wartenberg girls were just two of a teeming multitude of itinerant circus performers who passed through Paris\u2014to date no notice of their performance has come to light in the daily schedules of circuses that appeared in city newspapers\u2014yet Renoir endowed them with an elegance of form and a sensitivity that is usually associated with portraiture. His models would be forgotten today were it not for the serendipitous introduction of biographical detail in 1938, which transformed Acrobats into a noncommissioned portrait, allowing us to test the accuracy of the artist\u2019s rendering.\n\nThe artist\u2019s brother Edmond Renoir attested to the truthfulness of the representation in an article of 1879 for La vie moderne, in which he used the painting\u2019s correct title, Acrobats, and praised it as \u201cauthentic to modern life,\u201d though without mentioning the names of the models, their family background, or details of their routine. His comments appeared in a short biographical sketch written on the occasion of an exhibition primarily of pastels held at the office of La vie moderne in June: \u201cQuite apart from its artistic value, his work has all the distinctive charm of an authentic scene of modern life. What he has painted, we see every day; it is our own existence that he records in passages [pages] which will surely remain among the most vivid and harmonious of their time. Thus for the Acrobats the arrangement really doesn\u2019t matter. One could say that by a process of incomprehensible subtlety and instantaneity, he has captured the actual movement of the two children. It\u2019s just the way they walked, bowed, smiled in the circus ring. I will not use big words like realism or impressionism to say that this is real life with all its poetry and all its character.\u201d\n\nThis article functions less as a review than as a survey of Renoir\u2019s artistic development. Here we learn for the first time of Renoir\u2019s teenage years as a porcelain painter; of his first painting, Eve and the Serpent; of his debt to artists such as Gustave Courbet and Narcisse Diaz de la Pe\u00f1a. Mention is made of major Renoir paintings including Lise (1867; Museum Folkwang, Essen [Daulte 29 Dauberville 283]), Dance at the Moulin de la Galette (1876; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 209; Dauberville 211]), and Madame Georges Charpentier and Her Children (1878; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Daulte 266; Dauberville 239]), a painting then on view at the Salon of 1879, depicting the family of the publisher of La vie moderne. Edmond\u2019s lengthy discussion of Acrobats follows this list of Renoir\u2019s major accomplishments. La vie moderne was an odd choice of venue for the debut of this large painting, which was of a scale one might have expected to see at the Salon. It must have looked out of place among the smaller pastels. A second review in La presse, possibly also written by Edmond under a pseudonym, is only slightly more helpful in describing the exhibition as comprising \u201cabout thirty works, portraits in pastel, landscape paintings, decorative sketches.\u201d This second review also highlights the poetic reality (\u201cpo\u00e9sie r\u00e9elle\u201d) of Acrobats, though it suggests that the satin costumes worn by the girls were originally pink.\n\nDouglas Druick has challenged Edmond\u2019s contention that Acrobats is absent of convention or artifice. The warmth of the flesh tones of the two girls, the luminosity of their pink tights, wrinkled at the knee, and the bright tones of the white and yellow costumes all suggest that they were painted in natural light, rather than the harsh artificial light of the circus arena. Such lighting repelled Renoir because it contorted faces and transformed gestures into distorted caricature. This would imply that while the background may have been painted in situ, at the circus\u2014a hypothesis supported by the accurate yet schematic treatment of the spectators and the environment\u2014the girls themselves may not have been.\n\nWhile Edmond claimed that his brother portrayed the Wartenberg sisters just as they moved in the circus ring, there is nothing about their poses that conveys how they might have performed. The static appearance of the girls\u2019 positions may be the result of a studio setting. Renoir endowed his young acrobats with all the elegance of ballet dancers in their gestures and postures, which mimic ballet\u2019s third (Angelina) and fourth (Francisca) positions. Renoir\u2019s initial painted guidelines for the legs of the figures, visible in transmitted- and reflected-infrared images of Acrobats (fig. 9.1), suggest that he later adjusted Angelina\u2019s feet so that they overlap slightly and placed Francisca\u2019s left leg farther from her right in order to make this point precisely. Such a portrayal of the Wartenberg sisters is not consistent with the sensationalism and physical daring of their tableau vivant and human pyramid acrobatic acts. Renoir\u2019s presentation of the girls in a way that equates them with the highbrow world of the ballet is a prime demonstration of his \u201coeil bienveillant,\u201d or what Colin Bailey has referred to as \u201caesthetic leveling.\u201d\n\nThe elegant poses and full-length treatment of the figures in Acrobats recall Renoir\u2019s earlier painting of an aspiring child performer, The Dancer (fig. 9.2) [Daulte 110; Dauberville 493]), exhibited at the first Impressionist exhibition, which opened in April 1874. With dimensions of 142.5 \u00d7 94.5 cm, The Dancer is just eleven centimeters taller and five centimeters narrower than Acrobats, which was executed on a no. 60 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. Renoir\u2019s ballerina appears to be a younger trainee known as a \u201crat de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra,\u201d commonly of an age between eight and fourteen. In Acrobats Renoir drew on the same strategy of harmonized color application throughout the canvas that he used in The Dancer, which is dominated by cooler tones\u2014blues and greens, with blue accents in the shadows of the shimmering white ballet costume. Acrobats was rendered in a contrasting palette of mostly yellows and oranges. The costumes of the two Wartenberg girls, from the yellow boots to the tassels and stars to the ribbons in their hair, serve to establish a color theme. Renoir then developed the color harmonies in the extensive use of yellow in the arena floor, which acts essentially as a diaphanous background of the kind he presented in The Dancer.\n\nAdditional evidence exists that Renoir\u2019s portrayal departs from the actual circumstances of the girls\u2019 performance. A rare preliminary study for Acrobats, a chalk drawing executed on canvas, includes a clown in the bottom right (fig. 9.3), and, in fact, the two young girls likely would have shared the arena with other circus acts. The absence of the clown in the painting and the centering of the Wartenberg sisters in the composition subdue the ribald ambience of the circus in order to better focus on the girls\u2019 contentment and pleasure at collecting the oranges, thus giving this circus genre painting a stronger emotional impact. It is evident from the drawing that Renoir had already decided on the raised point of view with its limited details of the circus arena and the unusual balletic poses. In the painting, the circus-ring wall is taller and closer to the top of the composition, eliminating all but one of the spectators\u2019 faces and leaving only the legs of the staff and other performers waiting their turns, thus further distancing the children from the boisterous adult realm of the circus arena.\n\nFrancisca and Angelina were the eldest siblings in a family of Franco-German gymnasts. There were seven Wartenberg children by the mid-1880s, all of whom collaborated in performances such as \u201cle Montagne,\u201d a variation on the human pyramid (fig. 9.4). As anchors for the pyramid, Angelina and Francisca were of a robust and muscular build by that time, much more physically developed than their diminutive likenesses in Renoir\u2019s painting. A promotional photograph of the Wartenberg children performing in Saint Petersburg, possibly from 1880, shows the two older girls with two of their younger siblings, who appear to be about five or six years old (fig. 9.5). In this photograph, Angelina and Francisca look more mature than they do in the painting. As the two appear alone in Renoir\u2019s Acrobats, presumably either none of their siblings were old enough to participate in the act, or the two were performing as a duo on that occasion.\n\nAngelina was baptized in Berlin on March 13, 1864, by her parents, Carl Richard Ludwig Wartenberg, \u201cGymnastischer K\u00fcnstler,\u201d and Jos\u00e9phine Hermine Wartenberg, n\u00e9e Decamps. While Angelina stayed in London after the family became naturalized British citizens in 1889, Francisca sought opportunity as a circus performer in the United States (fig. 9.6) where she eventually married George Sebastian Miehling, a \u201cprofessional instructor\u201d at the Olympic Club of San Francisco.\n\nVariously ascribed dates from 1868 to 1882 within Renoir\u2019s lifetime, the current accepted dating of Acrobats to 1879 (based on the painting\u2019s first appearance at exhibition) would mean that Angelina and Francisca are shown at the ages of fourteen and seventeen, respectively. Earlier references to the painting suggest that the models were perceived as younger. In her 1938 letter to her niece, Angelina stated that Renoir portrayed the sisters as \u201cCircus Kids\u201d at the beginning of their careers. In 1879 Edmond Renoir referred to the girls as \u201cenfants\u201d in his review in La vie moderne, and Paul Durand-Ruel recorded the painting\u2019s title as Les petites acrobates when it was deposited by Renoir in April 1881. Renoir himself referred to them as \u201cfillettes\u201d (little girls)\u2014a term not usually applied to postpubescent teenagers. Acquired by Potter Palmer from Durand-Ruel in May 1892 as Dans le cirque, the painting carried the title Two Little Circus Girls for more than fifty years in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago. The firm handling of the figures, the signature, the elevated point of view, and the thematic emphasis on the color yellow all point to Renoir\u2019s Impressionist style of the later 1870s, such as that seen in Mussel Fishers at Berneval (fig. 9.7 [Daulte 292; Dauberville 215]). Clearly the lighting and the elegance of the poses of the two models were not the only aspects of the painting with which Renoir took license.\n\nAngelina\u2019s letter of 1938 suggests that the Wartenberg family enjoyed a happy and thriving life in the circus. This was not the case for other circus troupes that included young children. Fernand Pelez\u2019s Grimaces and Misery (The Saltimbanques), shown at the Salon of 1888 (fig. 9.8), is a sad testimony to the common exploitation of children, who were often unwillingly pressed into a life of grinding poverty and long hours. Pelez practiced a style of Realism compatible with the novels of \u00c9mile Zola, who often wrote about the harsh conditions of urban living for the lower classes. In his description of his brother\u2019s painting Acrobats as \u201creal life with all its poetry and character,\u201d Edmond pointed to an alternative kind of Realism, one that sought beauty and dignity in those conditions and in the most lowbrow of popular distractions. Edmond de Goncourt made the same argument when he called for a \u201croman r\u00e9aliste de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gance\u201d in the preface to Les fr\u00e8res Zemganno. In creating a circus performer who was a sympathetic figure with complex emotions, Goncourt followed the example of writers such as Charles Baudelaire and the Parnassian poet Th\u00e9odore de Banville, who endowed the circus theme with a new level of literary significance.\n\nIn 1868 Renoir departed from his usual routine of preparing large-scale paintings for the Salon to fulfill a request from a caf\u00e9 owner at the Cirque Napol\u00e9on (today the Cirque d\u2019Hiver) for a portrait of the clown James Bollinger Mazutreek (fig. 9.9 [Daulte 38; Dauberville 230]). The Impressionists were often drawn to the circus as a subject of modern life, but in this painting the artist did not convey the spectacle of performance. Rather, in the calm poise of Mazutreek\u2019s bearing and the outstretched gesture of his bow arm, Renoir presented the performer in a pose that recalls the Apollo Belvedere (albeit an unusually frizzy-haired version), just as he later elevated the popular context of Acrobats by showing it through the lens of high art. The natural light in which the Wartenberg sisters are portrayed sets Acrobats apart from the earlier Clown, in which Mazutreek\u2019s painted white face gives off an eerie luminosity, while his dark, butterfly-bedecked costume and the dull brown of the circus floor absorb rather than reflect the light. In both circus paintings, Renoir altered how the subject was generally viewed. As his brother Edmond asserted, Renoir created a \u201cpoetic reality\u201d out of the discordant atmosphere of the circus ring. In doing so, he drew on his gifts as a portrait painter to see beyond the thespian mask, thus drawing attention to the acrobats as sensitive individuals.\n\nThe year 1875 marked an important milestone in French circus history, with the completion in June of the Cirque Fernando\u2019s permanent building in Montmartre at the corner of the boulevard de Rochechouart and the rue des Martyrs, just a short walk from Renoir\u2019s rue Saint-Georges studio. Though never specifically identified as such during Renoir\u2019s lifetime, it is likely that the Cirque Fernando is the setting for Acrobats. From 1873 to 1875, the Cirque Fernando operated at the site under a temporary tent supported by a timber structure strong enough to hold a musician\u2019s box; this box can be seen in Maurice Blum\u2019s Rehearsal at the Cirque Fernando, which was accepted to the Salon of 1874 (fig. 9.10). The multiple figures shown at work in this painting provide evidence that individual performers often shared the arena with other acts or roaming clowns.\n\nAcrobats is not simply a return to a favorite leitmotif, or a variation on the theme of popular culture; it can be interpreted as a parable of childhood experience in the commercial world of leisure in nineteenth-century Paris. The appearance of children in Renoir\u2019s Impressionist work often symbolizes the same joy and happiness he intended to convey with the presence of sunlight. It is significant that, in returning to the subject of the circus later in life, he chose to portray his own sons\u2014Jean as Pierrot (fig. 9.11 [Dauberville 2390]) and Claude as a clown (fig. 9.12 [Dauberville 3455]), at the ages of seven and seven or eight, respectively\u2014as if the world of the funambule were a rite of passage. These portraits depict whimsical, costumed role-playing, but they also evoke Renoir\u2019s working-class roots and a youth spent enthralled by the theatrical life of the boulevard du Temple.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began this painting with a large, no. 60 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas with a commercially applied white ground; a radio-opaque area in the X-ray as well as areas of visible palette-knife texture may indicate that either the artist or the color merchant added more ground material locally or overall to the compositional area. Renoir executed a gestural contour drawing of the figures in deep-blue paint, making many alterations and adjustments to each figure before settling on the final composition. There are also indications that finer drawing, perhaps in graphite, is present in the faces of the figures. The figure on the right appears to have been more forward-facing and slightly bent at the waist, while the figure on the left may have stood with her legs closer together, slightly to the left of their current position, and with a more arched back and curved arms. Though some of these changes were painted out, others (such as the hands of the figure on the left) remain visible under normal viewing conditions due to the translucence of the background paint. In the background and upper portion of the composition, thinned oil paint, translucent pigments such as red lake, and the artist\u2019s use of wiping and scraping combine to create an overall lightness and render the ground visible. The two figures were executed in a series of wet-in-wet campaigns over, in some areas, a still-wet underdrawing. Often the underdrawing functions as a cool shadow along the edges of forms, as in the figures\u2019 tights. Final touches of opaque paint and impasto appear only on selected areas of the figures, mostly in the embellishments on their costumes.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 9.13).\n\nSigned: Renoir. (lower left, in blue-purple paint) (fig. 9.14, fig. 9.15).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas were approximately 130.5 \u00d7 97 cm, measuring from the original foldover. This is close to pretreatment measurements that list the painting at 130.8 \u00d7 97 cm, which closely correspond to a no. 60 portrait (figure) standard-size (130 \u00d7 97 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 28.1V (1.2) \u00d7 29.4H (0.6) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas is relatively fine, especially considering its size, and has extremely faint cusping along all four sides, corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. The warp-angle map (horizontal threads) indicates primary cusping along the lower edge from the commercial preparation process (fig. 9.16).\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was relined in 1972, the original dimensions were increased slightly on all sides.\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 7\u20138.5 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nPrevious stretcher: Six-member keyable stretcher with vertical and horizontal crossbars. Depth: Unknown. Since the painting was lined at some point before this stretcher was removed in 1972, it is unclear whether it was the original stretcher.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nCross-sectional analysis indicates a very thin, brownish layer of material between the ground and the canvas that closely follows the canvas texture. This material has a blue fluorescence in UV, is organic in nature, and is estimated to be glue (fig. 9.17).\n\nThe canvas is coated with a commercial priming layer approximately 5\u201375 \u00b5m thick, that fills the weave and extends to the edges of the tacking margins.\n\nRenoir or a color merchant may have added more ground material in some areas, or perhaps an overall but very uneven layer. A horizontal band just above the center of the painting appears more radio-opaque in the X-ray, suggesting thicker application. Elsewhere, rough palette-knife marks appear in this white layer, creating a play of texture beneath the thinly painted surface (fig. 9.18). The artist painted the background largely in thin, translucent layers with a stiff-bristle brush that cut through to the ground beneath, exploiting its light, reflective qualities.\n\nThe ground is white, with no additional particles visible under stereomicroscopic or cross-sectional examination (fig. 9.19).\n\nThe commercial ground is a single layer, predominantly lead white with a small amount of calcium-based white (including calcium sulfate) and trace amounts of alumina, silica, and iron-containing complex silicates. The additional selective preparatory layer is also mostly lead white with some calcium sulfate and barium sulfate. The binder for both layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nInfrared examination suggests that Renoir sketched some of the major features of the figures, including the heads, hands, and legs, in long, sometimes very gestural lines (fig. 9.20). These contours appear to constitute the initial phase of the paint layer and in some areas were worked wet-in-wet into the flesh tones, where they appear as shadows (fig. 9.21). The brushstrokes vary greatly in thickness and assurance, with longer lines along the figures\u2019 legs and shorter, broader, more gestural strokes made with a wider brush in other areas, such as the left figure\u2019s hands and arms. Looking closely at the infrared image, it is also possible to see finer drawing throughout the figures\u2019 faces (fig. 9.22).\n\nThe contour sketch was executed in fluid, blue paint, while the finer drawing may be in a dry medium such as graphite.\n\nIt is unclear to what extent the underdrawing lines were worked into the paint layer and thereby obscured, but there are visible changes to both figures. The speed with which the artist executed the many iterations of each figure resulted in a series of underdrawing lines in relatively close proximity that can be difficult to decipher.\n\nUnderdrawing lines for the right figure suggest that she may have originally been shown somewhat bent at the waist, leaning slightly to her left, and holding a mound of oranges topped by four of the fruits rather than three (fig. 9.23). Lines sketching wider legs and a fuller costume around the waist and hips can also be discerned. Around the head, Renoir painted out his changes, and thus it is unclear to what extent the head was realized before he executed its final position. Eventually he straightened the figure\u2019s posture and rotated her left shoulder and hip backward. The arms and the placement of the elbows and fingers were adjusted numerous times. A set of lines also indicates that this figure\u2019s legs may have been positioned side by side, rather than slightly overlapping, so that the shadow between the legs as well as the outer edge of the figure\u2019s left leg were both further to the right. A combination of turning the figure\u2019s upper body and moving her left leg slightly in front of her right, into ballet\u2019s third position, resulted in legs that appear slimmer and more compact.\n\nThe artist also made changes to the arms and legs of the left figure; he adjusted the precise angle of the arms at each of the major joints (shoulder, elbow, and wrist) numerous times before arriving at the final placement (fig. 9.24). The nature of the underdrawing lines indicating the left figure seems more gestural, aimed at determining the pose and general placement of the figure rather than delineating specific anatomical features. The lines for the figure\u2019s hands, arms, and lower legs, for example, appear impossibly curved and likely served to work out the sense of movement in her pose. Lines visible in the infrared image also suggest that the figure\u2019s left leg was initially further to the left, directly below and in line with her ear and the back of her head. Renoir moved the left leg away from the right, into ballet\u2019s fourth position, in line with the figure\u2019s profile; the angle of her right foot was also turned out further, so that her laces face the viewer. A painted line further to the right that echoes the shape of this leg may indicate yet another previous placement, or that the leg was once wider.\n\nRenoir executed a contour sketch of the figures in blue paint, adjusting their postures many times before settling on the visible composition. In many areas, these sketched lines appear to have been wet when the upper paint layers were added, and as a result they were partially, and in some cases entirely, incorporated into these layers. Transmitted- and reflected-infrared imaging and X-radiography indicate that many of the changes were made in the underdrawing stage and not executed in heavier paint before additional alterations were made. The artist exploited the coolness of these lines in relation to the other colors in the painting, bringing smooth, blended figure-ground transitions over them to create a blue shadow around the edges of the figures, especially in the flesh tones and tights (fig. 9.25). In other areas, where the contours of the underdrawing deviate greatly from the surface composition, the lines can be seen under normal viewing conditions as echoes of existing forms or dark, somewhat muddy areas. For instance, on each side of the right figure\u2019s legs, parallel curving lines are visible, evidence of previous compositional forays. In some areas, the underdrawing material was swept into the upper layers to varying degrees, necessitating a more opaque application of background colors to completely cover the white ground, as in the area around the left figure\u2019s hands (fig. 9.26). In other places, the visibility of changes between the underdrawing and the surface composition is diminished by the addition of white or very light-colored paint before the application of the background, for example, above and to the right of the right figure\u2019s head (fig. 9.27).\n\nThe artist made minor changes to the two figures in the painting stage, slimming the legs and lowering the eyelids of both. The pointed chin of the figure on the right was softened, her neck was widened on the left side, and the costume embellishment was brought up around the nape of her neck; the overall effect of these alterations is that the once heart-shaped face now looks more elongated and oval-shaped. The left figure\u2019s profile in the underdrawing and early paint stages appears fine featured, with a diminutive nose and small chin. The chin was preserved, but the nose was enlarged and the lips brought forward so that the figure now appears to have an overbite in profile.\n\nThe work is very thinly painted, and the paint was applied using stiff-bristle brushes that scratched through the paint layers to the ground. Renoir used wiping and scraping, especially in the background, to increase this effect and give the paint layer additional translucency, making use of the reflective qualities of the ground. The almost watercolor-like appearance of the paint in some areas indicates that the artist thinned his paints with turpentine or a turpentine-and-oil mixture. In contrast with much of the background, the figures are painted in flat, medium-rich layers of opaque paint and feature smooth transitions, both between light and shadow and between figure and ground. The figures were executed in a series of wet-in-wet campaigns with soft brushes, and Renoir sometimes used an array of colors in a single area (fig. 9.28). The upper portion of the painting seems to have been executed mostly freehand and wet-in-wet, with an initial campaign of broader modeling primarily with translucent browns, black, and red lake, followed by a campaign of details, contours, and patches of opaque paint (fig. 9.29). In some areas showing the audience, the paint appears to have been partially rubbed away with a cloth or other soft material, leaving a thin film of paint, mostly in the interstices of the weave. In the left figure\u2019s hair, for example, a thin reserve was created for the bow; after the hair was painted, the artist seems to have wiped away some of this paint before adding heavier, opaque details for the bow (fig. 9.30). The final touches of white and yellow impasto are generally limited to decorative details on the figures\u2019 costumes (fig. 9.31).\n\nSoft- and stiff-bristle brushes with strokes up to 1 cm wide; cloth and/or palette knife for wiping and scraping; small palette knife for specific details such as the orange rinds.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, vermilion, emerald green, chrome yellow, red lake, iron oxide red and/or yellow, and bone black.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence under UV light suggests the presence of a fluorescing red lake in the flesh tones, details of the figure\u2019s boots, and parts of the background (fig. 9.32).\n\nCross-sectional analysis also suggests that some of the pigment mixtures employed in this painting were quite complex. A sample from the orange on the ground between the two figures, for example, contains a mixture of vermilion, red lake, chrome yellow, lead white, and cobalt blue, with traces of iron oxide red and/or yellow.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work has a synthetic varnish with residues of natural-resin varnish in areas of impasto. The synthetic varnish dates from the 1971\u201372 treatment, and the previous natural-resin varnish may date from a 1922 cleaning. Though the work was varnished in 1922, it is unclear whether it had been varnished prior to that time.\n\nEarly documentation indicates that the work was first treated, cleaned, and varnished on April 20, 1922. A 1937 document requests an estimate for a wax lining from Chicago conservator Leo Marzolo; there is, however, no evidence that this treatment was ever completed. A 1955 loan condition report notes a \u201cgouge\u201d along the left side near the bottom and heavy abrasion on the lower right. The work was treated again in 1971\u201372, when it was recorded as having an aqueous lining and a discolored natural-resin varnish. Before this 1971\u201372 treatment, the work also had small holes with associated vertical abrasion, as if it had fallen or scraped against an unidentified surface. During this treatment, grime, varnish, and the lining were removed, and the work was faced with mulberry-fiber paper and starch paste in preparation for lining. The old six-member stretcher was discarded when the work was wax-resin lined, and the lined painting was tacked onto a four-member redwood ICA spring stretcher of slightly larger dimensions (131.1 \u00d7 99.1 cm). The work was inpainted and given a synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, inpainting, and a final coat of L-46). In 2008 part of the original tacking margin was found to be delaminating from the lining; this area was consolidated.\n\nThe painting is in good condition: it is planar with a stable wax-resin lining and an even synthetic varnish. The work is damaged in a few places, and there is some minor age cracking intermittently throughout the figures\u2019 costumes. The overall abraded look of the background is the combined effect of the artist\u2019s wiping away paint layers and damage to the thinly painted areas due to the lining procedure. The lining process also increased the weave impression overall. There are a few minor losses that have been retouched, and there is slightly discolored retouching around the perimeter related to the expansion of the painting\u2019s dimensions during lining.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2003\u201304): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, mid-seventeenth-century, Louis XIII\u2013Louis XIV, carved gilt convex frame with alternating pendent bellflower and flower ornament, bracketed by foliate scrolls connected by strapwork, with acanthus leaves at the miters. The frame has water gilding over red-brown bole on gesso and retains its original gilding, though it has been abraded. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished, and the cove is burnished. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled, dovetailed splines. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ovolo with undulating scroll and bellflowers (a miniature version of the inner molding); scotia side; convex face with alternating pendent bellflower and flowers, bracketed by foliate scrolls connected by strapwork, with acanthus leaves at the miters, on a quadrillage bed; hollow frieze; and ogee sight molding with undulating scroll and bellflowers and acanthus leaves at the miters (fig. 9.33).\n\nPrevious frame (installed mid-1960s, removed 2003\u201304): The painting was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, Louis XVI reproduction, gilt architrave frame with leaf-tip sight molding and a wide, independent gilt liner. The frame was basswood, mitered and nailed, with heavily rubbed and selectively burnished water gilding over red bole on sprayed gesso (fig. 9.34).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933, removed mid-1960s): The painting was previously housed in a late-nineteenth\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, convex frame with alternating flower and pendent bellflower ornament bracketed by foliate scrolls, and anthemia corner cartouches and floral center cartouches. The frame had water and oil gilding over gesso and cast plaster. The sides were burnished, and the ornament was selectively burnished. The molding was mitered and nailed. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was square outer edge; scotia side; convex face with alternating flower and pendent bellflower ornament bracketed by foliate scrolls, and anthemia corner cartouches and floral center cartouches; sanded frieze; ovolo with dentil; cove sight; and an independent fillet liner with cove sight edge (fig. 9.35, fig. 9.36).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Deposited by the artist with Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 6, 1881.\n\nSold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris, May 12, 1882, for 2,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, May 11, 1892, for 8,000 francs.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Offices of La vie moderne, Cinqui\u00e8me exposition de La vie moderne, P.-A.

Mrs. Streckfus was quoting a letter from her Aunt Angelina dated 1938, which is not in the curatorial file, but she did include a reproduction of the painting clipped from Life magazine of September 8, 1941 (p. 59). It was reproduced as Jongleuses au cirque by Georges Rivi\u00e8re in Renoir et ses amis (H. Floury, 1921), pp. 145, 270.\n\nIn Les fr\u00e8res Zemganno (G. Charpentier, 1879, p. 151), Goncourt described \u201cun gymnaste minuscule de cinq ans [qui] mordait une orange qu\u2019on lui avait jet\u00e9.\u201d Colin B. Bailey related this passage to Acrobats in Renoir, Impressionism, and Full-Length Painting, exh. cat. (Frick Collection/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 124.\n\nIn a list of works that Renoir recalled having painted in his rue Saint-Georges studio, he included \u201cun Cirque o\u00f9 des fillettes jouaient avec des oranges\u201d; Ambroise Vollard, La vie et l\u2019oeuvre de Pierre-Auguste Renoir (A. Vollard, 1919), p. 67. There is clearly some ambiguity about what the girls are doing with the oranges. They have been described not only as \u201cjouaient\u201d (playing) by Renoir, but also as \u201cjongleuses\u201d (jugglers) by Georges Rivi\u00e8re (see note 1), and Angelina herself used the word collaring.\n\nEdmond Renoir, \u201cCinqui\u00e8me exposition de La vie moderne, P.-A. Renoir,\u201d La vie moderne 1, 11 (June 19, 1879), pp. 174\u201375. The piece was written as a letter to the editor of La vie moderne, \u00c9mile Bergerat, who presumably made the selection.\n\n\u201cVous n\u2019avez gu\u00e8re que des pastels; ne vous rendent-ils pas la m\u00eame impression que l\u2019huile? . . . son oeuvre a-t-elle en dehors de sa valeur artistique, tout le charme sui generis d\u2019un tableau fid\u00e8le de la vie moderne. Ce qu\u2019il a peint, nous le voyons tous les jours, c\u2019est notre existence propre qu\u2019il a enregistr\u00e9e dans des pages qui resteront \u00e0 coup s\u00fbr, parmi les plus vivantes et les plus harmonieuses de l\u2019\u00e9poque. Ainsi pour les Acrobates, l\u2019arrangement n\u2019y est r\u00e9ellement pour rien. On dirait que par un proc\u00e9d\u00e9 d\u2019une subtilit\u00e9 et d\u2019une instantan\u00e9it\u00e9 incompr\u00e9hensibles, il a saisi sur le fait le mouvement des deux enfants. C\u2019est bien comme cela qu\u2019elles marchaient, saluaient, souriaient, sur la piste du cirque. Je n\u2019emploierai ni ces grands mots de r\u00e9alisme ou d\u2019impressionnisme, pour dire que c\u2019est l\u00e0 de l\u2019existence r\u00e9elle avec toute sa po\u00e9sie et toute sa saveur.\u201d Edmond Renoir, \u201cCinqui\u00e8me exposition de La vie moderne, P.-A.

The article contains a long excerpt from Edmond Renoir\u2019s article in La vie moderne.  \n\nFurther testing would be needed to confirm or exclude the presence of faded red lakes in the costumes. It is worth noting that UV fluorescence, in addition to stereomicroscopic examination and cross-sectional analysis in some cases, confirms the presence of unfaded red lakes, both alone and in mixtures, throughout other areas of the work, including the flesh tones and areas of the background (see Palette). Without the presence of characteristic fluorescence, and with the means of scientific analysis currently available, determination of a possible second, nonfluorescing, faded red lake cannot be made conclusively unless a paint sample is removed from the area of interest; such a sample was not available at the time of this study.\n\nDouglas Druick, Renoir, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1997), p. 40.\n\n\u201cRenoir, que le cirque Fernando amusait comme tous les spectacles populaires, ne fut jamais tent\u00e9 d\u2019en peindre l\u2019aspect. Cette abstention est assez significative. La foule qui le s\u00e9duit au Moulin de la Galette, ne le sollicite plus quand elle est au cirque. C\u2019est qu\u2019au bal, le soleil ajoute la gaiet\u00e9 de sa lumi\u00e8re \u00e0 la joie des danseurs, tandis qu\u2019au cirque, l\u2019\u00e9clairage incertain rend les visages grima\u00e7ants, d\u00e9forme les gestes, et que Renoir r\u00e9pugnait \u00e0 cette d\u00e9formation caricaturale.

Floury, 1921), p. 146.\n\nMy thanks to Kelly Keegan for pointing out the ballet positions; see Revisions in the technical report.\n\nThe idea of the \u201coeil bienveillant\u201d is taken from Georges Rivi\u00e8re, Renoir et ses amis (H. Floury, 1921), p. 108: \u201cRenoir regarde la vie d\u2019un oeil bienveillant et il la montre toujours sous un aspect sympathique.\u201d Colin Bailey has applied this concept to portrait painting: \u201cYet Renoir\u2019s portraits of the beau monde\u2014particularly its children\u2014are generally as affectionate and engaging as his portraits of bohemian friends and fellow artists. His \u2018oeil bienveillant\u2019 operates a sort of aesthetic levelling in which actresses and circus performers are presented with the same charm and directness as chatelaines and society hostesses, in which the children of petit bourgeois clerks and shopkeepers are as commanding as the pampered offspring of provincial senators or the privileged sons and daughters of bankers and doctors.\u201d Colin B.

(Frick Collection/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 45.\n\nColin Bailey has asserted that the drawing must have been executed before the painting; Colin B. Bailey, Renoir, Impressionism, and Full-Length Painting, exh. cat. (Frick Collection/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 129, fig. 5. Indeed, the positions of the figures in the drawing very closely resemble the earlier positions of the figures visible in the infrared images of the painting. See Compositional planning/underdrawing/painted sketch in the technical report.\n\nThe similarity of the poses in the drawing and the painting raises the possibility that the drawing was made in preparation for an illustration of the finished painting to be published in La vie moderne, though no such illustration ever appeared in the journal. Given how the changes transform the mood of the painting, however, it seems unlikely that Renoir would have reversed his thinking.\n\nThe date 1880 is handwritten on the back of the photograph in ink.\n\nBaptismal record for Angelina Jos\u00e9phine Hermine Wartenberg, baptized in the Dorotheenstadtkirche Mar. 13, 1864, Evangelisches Zentralarchiv, Berlin. Angelina was presumably baptized soon after her birth, and the record gives the names of her parents and lists her father\u2019s profession as \u201cgymnastic artist.\u201d This information, as well as the photographs and poster illustrated in this entry, first came to light as part of the research for Renoir\u2019s Portraits; see Colin B.

The affidavit of birth for Marguerite Georgina Miehling, City and County of San Francisco, Sept. 21, 1934, in the curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago, notes that Frances Charlotte Wartenberg was age 41 at the time of her daughter\u2019s birth on Jan. 13, 1902.\n\nJulius Meier-Graefe erroneously gave Acrobats a date of 1868, as he thought it close in time to The Clown (see fig. 9.9); see Julius Meier-Graefe, Auguste Renoir (R. Piper, 1911), p. 16. Ambroise Vollard first catalogued it as 1882; see Ambroise Vollard, Tableaux, pastels et dessins de Pierre-Auguste Renoir, vol. 1 (A. Vollard, 1918), p. 87, no. 348. In her letter to the Art Institute of Chicago, Marguerite Streckfus specified that the girls posed in 1870, at the ages of seven and ten years. \u201cThe Girl on the left was my mother; Francisca Wartenberg, at that time ten years old, and one on the right, my Aunt, Angelina Wartenberg, then seven years old. Children of a large family of Circus Troopers happened to be in Paris in 1870 and subsequently to have aroused Renoir\u2019s interest at that time.\u201d Marguerite Streckfus to the Art Institute of Chicago, Jan. 22, 1942, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago; excerpt published in Art Institute of Chicago, Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago: A Catalogue of the Picture Collection (Art Institute of Chicago, 1961), pp. 394\u201395. Marguerite was conveying information provided by her aunt, Angelina, in 1938. Marguerite\u2019s date is not plausible, however, as it was not until the autumn of 1873 that Renoir occupied his studio at 35, rue Saint-Georges, where he claimed to have painted the picture; see \u201cChronology,\u201d in Hayward Gallery, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Renoir, exh. cat.

It cannot be ruled out that Renoir drew on his experience of the girls at the circus earlier in the decade.\n\nTo quote Goncourt\u2019s preface more extensively: \u201cCe roman r\u00e9aliste de l\u2019\u00e9l\u00e9gance, \u00e7a avait \u00e9t\u00e9 notre ambition \u00e0 mon fr\u00e8re et \u00e0 moi de l\u2019\u00e9crire.

Floury, 1921], p. 146), it was not identified as the setting for Acrobats until 1925, when the name was incorporated into the title in a list of works appended to the English translation of Ambroise Vollard\u2019s La vie et l\u2019oeuvre de Pierre-Auguste Renoir; in that list, Young Girl Jugglers, Cirque Fernando was dated 1875.

The presence and proportion of these extenders may indicate that this layer was applied by a color merchant and not by Renoir; however, it is very uneven (see Preparatory Layers). See also Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSome of the earlier positions of the figures are very similar to those in a sketch titled The Acrobats (see fig. 9.3 in the curatorial entry). Colin Bailey has identified this related work as a preparatory sketch. See the discussion in Colin B. Bailey, Renoir, Impressionism, and Full-Length Painting, exh. cat. (Frick Collection/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 129, fig. 5.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is a mixture containing predominantly cobalt blue and red lake. The presence of cobalt was confirmed with XRF. See Marc Vermeulen, \u201cRen\\_22\\_440\\_Acrobats\\_XRF,\u201d Jul. 19, 2012, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Red lake was visually identified by stereomicroscopic examination.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and the standard size may be a result of this approximation.\n\nStrong cusping along a single side of a canvas generally indicates that it came from the edge of a larger section of canvas (1\u20132 meters wide by 5\u201310 meters long) that was commercially prepared and later cut down to make smaller canvases. For a discussion of commercial canvas preparation, see David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46; Iris Schaefer, Caroline von Saint-George, and Katja Lewerentz, Painting Light: The Hidden Techniques of the Impressionists (Skira, 2008), p. 52. Thread-angle maps were produced with Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg), Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1884 (D297/1922.440),\u201d Jan. 2012.\n\nSee Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg), Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1884 (D297/1922.440),\u201d Jan. 2012.\n\nA cross section taken from the edge of the tacking margin contains the canvas and all commercial preparatory layers. The sizing layer exhibits a bluish autofluorescence associated with organic materials, such as glue. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIn a single sample from near the left foldover in an area appearing to have extra ground material, all layers were not present. But the layer immediately beneath the paint layers is white and has a different composition than the commercial ground, suggesting that it is an additional layer. Since the ground was not present in this sample, the exact layering cannot be determined. In addition to lead white, small amounts of barium sulfate and calcium sulfate were identified by SEM/EDX. The presence and proportion of these extenders may indicate that this layer was applied by a color merchant and not by Renoir; however, further analysis would be needed to confirm. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of lead and calcium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected small amounts of alumina, silica, iron-containing complex silicates, and calcium-based white in the lower layer, and calcium sulfate and barium sulfate in the additional layer. See Marc Vermeulen, \u201cRen\\_22\\_440\\_Acrobats\\_XRF,\u201d Jul. 19, 2012; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nThese fine lines appear to be graphite. Such faint lines may be obscured in infrared imaging in some areas due to the presence of infrared-absorbing pigments in the paint layers or additional underdrawing. As a result, the possibility of graphite lines elsewhere in the painting, though not visible under the current circumstances, cannot be excluded.\n\nA related sketch, The Acrobats (see fig. 9.3 in the curatorial entry), offers clues to the possible initial postures of the two figures, as reflected in both the infrared and transmitted-infrared images. If the figures in the sketch are considered individually, and each is overlaid with the corresponding figure in the painting, some of the many lines and changes in the painting can be identified more clearly. Colin Bailey determined that this related work was a preparatory sketch. See the discussion in Colin B. Bailey, Renoir, Impressionism, and Full-Length Painting, exh. cat. (Frick Collection/Yale University Press, 2012), p. 129, fig. 5.\n\nThe initial posture of this figure is very similar to that in the related sketch The Acrobats (see fig. 9.3 in the curatorial entry).\n\nInterestingly, the related sketch, The Acrobats (see fig. 9.3 in the curatorial entry) also appears to show this figure\u2019s legs side by side.\n\nThe figure\u2019s left foot also looks strangely angled in the transmitted-infrared image, with an apparent sharp angle at the heel rather than the smooth curve of her shoe visible in the final composition. This is similar to the depiction of this foot in the related sketch, The Acrobats (see fig. 9.3 in the curatorial entry).\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, iron oxide red and/or yellow, vermilion, chrome yellow, cobalt blue (XRF, SEM/EDX); emerald green (XRF); bone black, cerulean blue (containing magnesium) (SEM/EDX). Red lake was visually identified by cross sectional analysis. See Marc Vermeulen, \u201cRen\\_22\\_440\\_Acrobats\\_XRF,\u201d Jul. 19, 2012; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.

See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThis mixture also contains calcium sulfate and barium sulfate, probably extenders. The pigment mixture was identified using SEM/EDX. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_440\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 20, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed.
