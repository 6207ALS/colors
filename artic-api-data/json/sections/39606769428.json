Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at several distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of print production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nFor this third-state impression of Manau tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her), the artist printed the block on the same thin, pale-pink wove paper that he used for printing working-proof impressions. Gauguin usually printed his proof impressions on one of three types of pink paper or on tan wove paper of inferior quality to those papers that he selected to print later-state impressions. The use of a sheet of pale-pink proofing paper here indicates that the artist may have considered the printing of this impression as an experimental endeavor to see if he could successfully transfer the delicate twill impression onto the paper\u2019s smooth, well-sized surface.\n\nGauguin printed the block twice to create this impression. Brown ink, which was applied unevenly in a very thin layer, was used first. It is a mixture of vermilion, chrome yellow or chrome orange, and carbon black (est.). The black ink used for the printing on top of the brown ink layer combines the same pigments with a greater amount of carbon black (est.).\n\nThe thin, smooth, lightweight, pale-pink wove paper has faded to tan; a very faint pink tone remains barely discernible. The paper is a poor-quality, Western, machine-made sheet. The paper fibers are distributed evenly and the paper is uniform in color. There are no inclusions or colored fibers present. A fine mesh pattern is visible in transmitted light. This pattern is unrelated to the pattern of fine diagonal lines visible on the surface of the print, known as a transferred twill impression, that will be discussed in detail below.\n\nGauguin used this paper to print a number of early-state impressions. In them, one side of the sheet has a glossy surface and the other is matte. He printed on both the glossy side and the matte side, seemingly indiscriminately, and impressions have been identified with the glossy side on the recto and others with the glossy side on the verso (fig. 60.2.2). This print, however, was mounted in the past with a piece of dry mount tissue onto a secondary support so that an accurate assessment of the original surface texture is not possible. The paper used for this impression was previously misidentified as papier satin\u00e9, a type of paper that was commonly burnished on both sides. The papers, also known as casing papers, were thin brown or pale buff papers used for packaging and labels. It is likely that Gauguin\u2019s chosen papers were used for the same purpose.\n\n204 \u00d7 356 mm (image); 207 \u00d7 357 mm (sheet)\n\nGauguin printed the block twice, skewing it ever so slightly in a double printing so that the underlying brown printing is discernible along the edge of the mat and along the left edge of the image (fig. 60.2.3). The artist inked the block first with a very thin, uneven layer of brown that he wiped away, thereby \u201cdrawing\u201d the contours of the female form and establishing volume within the form. He then laid a cloth down onto the surface of the block to remove excess ink, imparting a twill impression in the brown ink layer that is visible primarily in the figure; its presence elsewhere is mostly obscured by black ink. Gauguin transferred the twill impression by placing a woven material over the inked block and rubbing it to selectively remove some of the ink as the material was lifted from the block (fig. 60.2.4). The texture of the weave imparted a pattern of regularly spaced diagonal striations running from upper left to lower right overall, similar in appearance to the twill pattern found in canvases, cloth, and in this case, perhaps the rag the artist used to wipe ink from the block.\n\nThe second time Gauguin inked the block, he used black ink that he wiped extensively through the center so that the underlying composition he created in the brown ink layer would remain visible. He rolled out more black ink behind the figure to create a denser black tone. Here and in an impression of Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58.2), where he used the same technique, the artist made a point of extending the black ink into the hair of both figures central to each composition.\n\nBefore entering the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this print was mounted onto a secondary support using dry-mount tissue. It is likely that this drastic measure was taken to provide structural support to a paper that had become very brittle. Numerous cracks, tears, and losses appeared in many areas. The largest loss was found in the lower left. It had been filled with a toned, wove paper. The fill was stamped in the center with the collector\u2019s mark in black ink (W. G. / B [encircled]); tide lines as well as white inpainting surrounded the fill. Two round stains appeared in this area as well. Given the placement of the collector\u2019s stamp on the fill, it is likely that the print was mounted while in the private collection.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication, conservation treatment was undertaken to remove the secondary support and the dry-mount tissue from the print, to remove discoloration, and to provide a new Japanese paper lining for structural support. During treatment, a significant amount of discoloration released from the sheet. The old fill was removed and retained, and the new lining was adhered with wheat starch paste. The condition and appearance of the work were greatly improved by this intervention (fig. 60.2.1).  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nStray media visible only under high magnification include minute yellow and blue particles. The yellow particles are of the dimensional waxy/resinous type and the blue particles appear to have been added to the black ink. Although this print was not analyzed, comparison with other prints for which pigment analysis was carried out reveals that the printing inks are very similar if not identical. See, for example, Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58.2). Pigment analysis was carried out by C\u00e9line Daher; Daher, XRF analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nE. J.

The old fill with the collector\u2019s stamp is retained here as well. It has a very slight pink tone that would have been compatible with a less altered sheet tone overall.\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his property as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
