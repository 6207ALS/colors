    "transcript": "<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: What we see before us is a scene of consummate strangeness.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The painting was made in 1883 by the Swiss artist Arnold B\u00f6cklin. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: The scene is populated by strange and somewhat grotesque sea creatures, half man and half fish, mermaids and mermen. They seem to be engaged in a concert. The merman has this rather primitive lyre that he\u2019s playing on and his mouth is open in song. So, too, are the mouths of the mermaids who surround him. We know that the artist wanted the viewer to have a strong sense of sound, raucous sound shattering the crystalline calm of the sea that the creatures are playing in. The figure of the merman has been associated with the features of the artist himself.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Indeed, his lyre features B\u00f6cklin\u2019s initials. Just as these strange creatures shatter the calm of their environment. B\u00f6cklin intended to use his art to break out of the dominant artistic style of his time, which was French Impressionism.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: What he was trying to achieve was something different and it relied more on the imagination, painting coming from the imagination, from poetry, from myths of the past, and even from music. This is a world like ours but totally different from ours. And, so, it challenges us with its strangeness because it\u2019s familiar in some ways and totally different in others.</p>\n",
