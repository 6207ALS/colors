    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Illuminated by a glowing, heavenly light, the dead Christ is tenderly and reverently lowered into his tomb by his followers.  His pale body is as idealized as a classical marble sculpture.  Only discreet holes in his hand and foot indicate his terrible death on the cross, which looms in the background.  Surrounding Christ are his closest supporters.  To the left is his faithful follower, Mary Magdalene.  Her upward glance reminds us that Christ will shortly ascend into Heaven.  The older man is Nicodemus, a Jewish temple official, who came to Christ for instruction.  To the right is Christ's discipline John, and in the center, underlining her place in Christ's story, is the Virgin Mary.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PLANZER:  There's a sense of a timeless grief that's captured by the Virgin's clasped hands before her face, where in fact her grief is so great that we see the left tear on her cheek, but that the right side of her face is obscured, because it is a grief that is too great to be seen.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: While the profound emotions of these figures are expressed with restraint, the turbulent sky and stark trees in the background seem to articulate their sense of desolation.  The painting is by Guercino, one of the foremost painters of the northern Italy city of Bologna in the mid 17th century.</p>\n",
