    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Beneath a wide sky whose misty clouds hint at the changeable weather of Venice, businesses carried on as usual on the Grand Canal. Citizens visit the great baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute on the right, while black gondolas and commercial barges ply their trade on the water. To the left, we can see the large pinkish-colored palace of the Doge or ruler of Venice. The scene is by Francesco Guardi, who followed in the Venetian tradition of making vedute or views of the city, primarily intended for sale to wealthy foreign tourists. Bruce Boucher, curator of European sculpture.</p>\n<p>BRUCE BOUCHER: I always think that the best explanation for this kind of painting is a remark made by the great German poet Goethe who visited Venice in 1786, and he said, &quot;Whenever I step out of doors, I seem to see the latest and best painting of the Venetian school.&quot; And in effect, what we're seeing here is what Goethe would have seen, what anyone today can still see, and that is the city on view, on parade, the city as a subject of auto celebration. And the whole idea of creating a city in the middle of the lagoon was and still remains something of a wonder of the world.</p>\n",
