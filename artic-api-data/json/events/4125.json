    "description": "<p>Constantine Petridis, chair of the Department of the Arts of Africa and the Americas and curator of African art at the Art Institute of Chicago, discusses his book, <em>Luluwa: Central African Art between Heaven and Earth</em>, which was recently published by Mercatorfonds and Yale University Press.</p><p>Living in the region between the Lubudi and Kasai rivers in south central Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Luluwa people are known for their elaborately carved male and female figure sculptures, masks, and decorative arts. Constantine Petridis draws on firsthand accounts of numerous explorers, missionaries, colonial servants, anthropologists, and art historians who visited the region between the 1880s and the 1970s to comprehensively situate the Luluwa\u2019s ornate art in its original environment of production and use.&nbsp;</p><p>Through a close study of published and unpublished sources as well as museum objects and archival photographs, this book sheds new light on the historical context of one of central Africa\u2019s most spectacular artistic legacies, whose creation presumably dates back to the second half of the 19th century.</p>",
