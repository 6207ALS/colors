    "description": "<p>Schweikher completed his bachelor\u2019s degree at Yale\u2019s School of Architecture in 1929. Moving to Chicago in 1930 he worked for several local Modernist architects, including George Fred Keck and Philip Maher. His early reputation as an avant-garde architect was bolstered by his inclusion in the 1933 landmark exhibition on modern architecture at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Schweikher continued in various private partnerships until he was appointed chairman of the School of Architecture at Yale University, and subsequently, in 1958, head of the Department of Architecture at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). The collection consists of correspondence, research materials and photographs generated in the process of nominating Schweikher\u2019s own house in Schaumburg, Illinois, to the National Register of Historic Places.</p>\n<p>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Schweikher,%20Paul,%20House%20and%20Studio%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1&quot;&quot;&gt;View finding aid.</a><br>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Schweikher,%20Paul/field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1&quot;&quot;&gt;Paul Schweikher Oral History.</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
