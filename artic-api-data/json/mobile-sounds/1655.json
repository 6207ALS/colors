    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Former Director, Douglas Druick</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: This lively earthenware horse dates back to the 5th and 6th centuries A.D., during what is known as Japan's Kofun, or old tombs, era.  It would have marked the grave of a royal or noble personage.  It's called a haniwa, referring to clay figures set around a funeral mound.  The earliest haniwa were simple clay cylinders, and the cylindrical legs of this horse may reflect that original shape.  But there's an appealing realism here in the more detailed treatment of the saddle, stirrups, and dangling bell ornaments.  Horses were imported to Japan from Central Asia.  As instruments of war, they served as symbols of wealth and power.  Other haniwa take the shape of animals such as roosters, birds, deer, dogs, and even human figures, small houses, and boats.  Unlike Chinese tomb sculptures, haniwa are never glazed so that they retain a visual link to the earth.  Robert Allerton, a great benefactor to the museum, gave this haniwa to the Art Institute.  He served as both trustee and honorary president and donated over 6600 works of art during his lifetime.  The museum's original building on Michigan Avenue, flanked by our lions, was built in 1893 in conjunction with the World's Fair, held in Chicago.  The building bears his name.</p>\n",
