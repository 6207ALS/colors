    "title": "Fashioning the Object: Bless, Boudicca, Sandra Backlund",
    "description": "Bless, Boudicca, and Sandra Backlund are among the most visionary fashion designers working today. Harnessing a conceptual and intellectual approach to design, their practices are located firmly within the fashion industry, yet their work is not driven purely by market forces. Instead, they are aligned with the avant-garde tradition of designers who sought to transform the landscape of fashion through pieces embedded with visual narratives drawn from daily life, including early 20th-century notables Elsa Schiaparelli and Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga, later luminaries Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges and Mary Quant, and more recent creators such as Martin Margiela and Hussein Chalayan. Like these designers, Bless, Boudicca, and Backlund view fashion as a critical forum for dialogue and exchange, as well as an armature for understanding our place in the world. However, they endeavor to move beyond previous practices by drawing on an even greater spectrum of ideas inspired by disciplines as diverse as fine art, performance, design, and architecture to create work that responds to the social, political, and cultural environment and explores the creative process.",
