The image resembles Gustave Flaubert\u2019s description of Venus Anadyomene in his Temptation of Saint Anthony. In an 1889 drawing, Ensor reproduced this same figure as Venus on a half shell wearing a helmet instead of a crown and holding an apple with a serpent at her feet (fig. 1). These additions link both nudes to the Virgin Mary. The refined handling and unique subject matter differentiate this sheet from the surrounding ones, as if it had been created at an earlier stage and only later repurposed for the larger composition. The faces at upper left and the undulating female nudes along the right side spill over onto the adjacent sheets (4D and 4F) as if to connect them visually. Some details, such as the crown, were added later in black colored pencil. The drawing is diminished in some areas and is difficult to read under normal conditions, but details are identifiable with the aid of infrared reflectography (see fig. 2). SMC/KJN\n\nArtists have been inspired by the goddess of love\u2019s birth in the sea since antiquity. Ensor portrayed his Venus in a mandorla in this sheet, just as he did in his 1889 drawing (fig. 1). The mandorla was commonly used to denote the sacred character of the figures within it, as in images of Christ and the Virgin Mary in Western art, but its shape is also reminiscent of the shell that is one of Venus\u2019s attributes. Ensor was probably inspired in part by a sculpture of the goddess located in Brussels Park (fig. 3). In fact, his drawing of Venus is a mirror image of the sculpture. She is accompanied by the traditional attributes of temptation, the apple and the serpent. The Gothic arches behind her that form the mandorla are decorated with figures, fitting with the compositional complexity of The Temptation as well as recalling the carved creatures found on Gothic cathedrals.\n\nEnsor also used the Gothic arch and crowds in his drawing Christ in Hell (fig. 4). The figure of Christ hovers at the center of the arch, worshiped by a single adoring female figure. Surrounding these two are the souls trapped in hell, tangled in flames and bulging out toward the viewer. Ensor created an etching based on this drawing in 1895 (fig. 5).
