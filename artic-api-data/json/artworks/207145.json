Since then she has excelled at unflinching, intimate, and poetic images of cities and the people who dwell in them\u2014an attempt at creating, in Strauss\u2019s words, \u201can epic narrative about the beauty and struggle of everyday life.\u201d In a 10-year project beginning in 2001, she mounted one-day exhibitions each May\u2014several of which featured this portrait\u2014beneath an I-95 highway overpass in the neighborhood in South Philadelphia where she had grown up. She would attach her color photographs to the concrete columns supporting the expressway and make the prints available for the taking at the day\u2019s end.</p>\n",
