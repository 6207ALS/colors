Her soon-to-be husband, Charles Bunbury, commissioned this marriage portrait, making her association with the Graces\u2014symbols of fertility and attendants to the Roman goddess of love, Venus\u2014all the more appropriate.</p>\n<p>The first president of the Royal Academy in London, Sir Joshua Reynolds urged his fellow artists to paint historical and edifying subjects based on the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. As a portrait painter, he developed a grand style that ennobled the genre by giving his sitters Classical attributes and poses.</p>\n",
