    "description": "<p>The architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) was known for popularizing modernist commercial architecture in the postwar United States\u2014and later around the globe\u2014with prominent steel and glass office buildings like the 1952 <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158990/lever-house-model\" target=\"_blank\">Lever House</a> in New York and the 1957 <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158989/inland-steel-building-model-of-final-design\" target=\"_blank\">Inland Steel</a> Building in Chicago as well as large-scale projects like the master plan for a new town in Oak Ridge, Tennessee in 1949. Founded in Chicago in 1936 by Louis Skidmore and Nathaniel Owings, SOM opened an office in New York the following year, and later expanded to San Francisco, London, and cities around the world. One of the firm\u2019s groundbreaking innovations was a multidisciplinary corporate structure that incorporated architecture, engineering, and planning, which allowed SOM to realize complex projects like the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/179305/dining-hall-united-states-air-force-academy-colorado-springs-colorado-section\" target=\"_blank\">United States Air Force Academy</a> in Colorado (1954\u20131963) and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/235272/university-of-illinois-chicago-circle-campus-art-and-architecture-building\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois Circle Campus in Chicago</a> (1961\u20131970).</p><p>Collaboration between architectural designers and structural engineers has been a hallmark at SOM, producing innovative skyscrapers that have transformed skylines around the world. In Chicago, project lead Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Khan developed tubular frame systems\u2014for the John Hancock Center (now 875 North Michigan Avenue, 1969) and the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/247999/sears-willis-tower-chicago-illinois-massing-model\" target=\"_blank\">Sears Tower</a> (now Willis Tower, 1973), leading to the firm\u2019s work with supertall buildings like the Burj Khalifa (2010) in Dubai. The SOM Chicago office has also served as an important training ground for many local modern architects, such as Harry Weese, Gertrude Kerbis, Stanley Tigerman, and John Vinci. SOM has had a major role in the development of the Art Institute\u2019s campus, including partner Walter Netsch\u2019s design for a 1976 expansion of the museum and numerous designs for office and gallery renovations over the years.&nbsp;</p><p>The Art Institute\u2019s collection of drawings and models for seminal projects by SOM is complemented by a large body of research material in the the Ryerson and Burnham Archives, including the <a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/findingaids/search/searchterm/Graham,%20Bruce%20J.,%20Papers/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\" target=\"_blank\">Bruce J.
