Robinson, 1947.963\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Color undetermined. Blown and tooled. The rim, rounded by reheating, flares out from an almost cylindrical neck to form a funnel-shaped mouth. The neck spreads out and down from the mouth into a flattened globular body with a flat bottom without a pontil mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 119.1.\n\nIntact with dark weathering product on the interior and some incrustation. This dark crust was removed on the exterior, leaving a brilliant golden iridescent surface. One area at the base is flaking away to reveal very bubbly, heavily pitted vessel glass.\n\nThis is a completely ordinary flask or bottle that was produced in the thousands from the second to the fourth century A.D. However, owing to its particular burial in the soil, the surface has achieved an absolutely brilliant golden iridescence, an aesthetic that speaks to us today as it did to glassmakers in the mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries first in Europe and then in the United States.\n\nWhile the iridescence here is a result of multiple thin layers of glass diffusing the light to create these strong colors, the rainbow effect on nineteenth- and twentieth-century glasses was achieved with the addition of certain metallic oxides that when reheated created an iridescent surface on the glass.\n\nCompare the golden iridescence on this flask to the silver iridescence on the interior of a later bottle in the Art Institute of Chicago (cat. 120). There is a similar form in the Princeton University Art Museum.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Antonaras, Fire and Sand, pp. 191, no. 277, an ordinary bottle, slightly more globular in body with an infolded rim.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 119 Bottle, 2nd/3rd century A.D.\n\nfig. 119.1 Bottle (2nd/3rd century A.D.).
