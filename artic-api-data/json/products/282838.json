    "description": "A beautiful juxtaposition of color, soft and striking, this scarf makes quite an impression. Shades of pink, cream and gray are hand-painted by Joanna Alot on silk, for indulgent softness. Due to the handmade nature, each piece is unique. Made in the USA with eco-friendly dyes and paints.",
