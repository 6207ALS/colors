Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897 (see Technical Overview). So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. Gauguin produced this second issue of Le sourire with the hope of using the mimeograph to print multiples of images as well as the text (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text were rendered partially illegible due to broken lines and uneven printing (fig. 107.2). In later issues of the journal, he turned exclusively to wood-block printing for his illustrations.\n\nGauguin\u2019s lack of success using the Edison mimeograph to reproduce images compelled him to return to this issue after its initial printing to embellish it with the two smallest wood-block prints from the Le sourire series. Their cramped spacing and positioning in the margins underscores the fact that these additions were an afterthought. The blocks were inked either with a thin application or relatively dry black ink, yielding faint impressions. The text of the issue was printed by applying brownish-black ink through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself was responsible for the grainy appearance of the text (see Technical Overview).\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n350 \u00d7 520 mm (full sheet); 350 \u00d7 261 mm (folded sheet); 32 mm (diameter of printed monogram); 24 \u00d7 94 mm (title block)\n\nThe supplement is lost and may never have entered the collection.\n\nThe issue is in fair condition. It was mended along the central folds, but it cannot be determined when this was done.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
