    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Compare the shape and design of this exuberantly decorated dish with the subtle understated ceramics in the case on the left. When this dish was made, China was ruled by the Mongols, nomadic tribesmen from Mongolia and present day Manchuria. The Mongol\u2019s vast empire stretched westward across China through central Asia, much of present day Russia and west to the Caspian and Black Seas including present day Iran and Iraq. Under the Mongol rulers, Chinese ceramics like this were often made to order for foreign markets. The bracketed rim, for example, is inspired by Middle Eastern metal work while the magnified view of a bird in a garden setting surrounded by the decorative floral designs is more in keeping with Middle Eastern than with Chinese taste. The design isn\u2019t the only innovation. At about this time, the fourteenth century under glaze painting with cobalt blue began to transform the history of Chinese ceramics. The blue ore was brought from Persia along the Silk Road and is sometimes known as Mohammedan blue. The brilliance of the pigment is enhanced by the technique of overlaying a clear glaze over the painted body. Sharing large platters of food is an Islamic custom. The name Hasan ibn Mohammed inscribed in ink on the back of the dish is written Arabic script. We don\u2019t know, however, whether this style of porcelain dish was made for export or produced for an Islamic client living in China.&quot;</p>\n",
