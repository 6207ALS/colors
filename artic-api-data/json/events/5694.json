    "description": "<p>Join Eugene Wang, professor of Asian art at Harvard University, as he discusses the work of artist Lui Shou-Kwan.</p><p>Lui Shou-Kwan (1919\u20131975) is commonly recognized as a leading artist of Hong Kong's New Ink painting movement. Today, this style of painting is often aligned with the sort of spatter-and-daub Abstract Expressionism anchored by Jackson Pollock, but this alignment gives short shrift to the Hong Kong movement. With this lecture, Wang tells a fuller story of the movement and Shou-Kwan's place in it, as well as those of his artistic soulmates, Irene Chou and Liu Kuo-sung.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
