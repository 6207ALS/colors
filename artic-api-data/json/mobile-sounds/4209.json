    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator Jonathan Travares.</p>\n<p>Jonathan Travares: Perhaps one of the most unique weapons in the collection, and really one of the strangest pieces is this combination weapon, this cane sword wheellock pistol Warhammer, is really quite an imaginative piece. Its purpose-- well perhaps a little less for reality of self-defense and more for show, for display. It is meant to captivate and get the imagination excited about the possibilities. You know, we might think of a nobleman walking down an alley and he's taken over by highwaymen or robbers and he pulls out all his weapons here in one, but that is perhaps truly fantasy. What we're looking at here is a piece that would have been enjoyed and appreciated in the nobleman's wardrobe or his cabinet of arms, and he would have shown it to others. He also might have included this in what was called the Krinskommer [ph?] in Germany, or the art cabinet, the cabinet of curiosities, and that's what this is, it really is a curiosity. Certainly, maybe it could have been used to defend yourself, but it seems like a fantasy.</p>\n",
