    "description": "<p>Individually worked panels were sewn together to create this expansive skirt embellished with a kinetic array of patterns. The central floating motifs add lightness, especially when contrasted with the black-and-white checkerboard edge. Kuba men are responsible for preparing and weaving raffia, while Kuba women cut the appliq\u00fae shapes freehand to decorate the cloth. To make a skirt of this size, several women from the same extended family would construct different sections.</p>\n<p>The abstract forms may represent stylized humans, animals, plants, and objects. Constituting a kind of encrypted script, the repeating motifs\u2014including circles, lozenges, and L-shapes\u2014function as building blocks for the entire design. The comma-like shape that appears across parts of the skirt is called ishina'mbua, which translates as &quot;dog's tail&quot;\u2014a symbolic reference to the animal's keen sense of smell and vision as well as the spiritual qualities that the Kuba associate with the animal.</p>\n<p>At the turn of the previous century, when this skirt was made, European visitors to the Kuba kingdom recorded their admiration for the richly patterned raffia textiles that were worn and displayed at public festivals and funerals.</p>\n",
