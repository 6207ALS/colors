Rosalind was fifteen years old when her recently widowed sister married Whistler, and twenty-three when this image was drawn. She and her mother often visited the Whistlers when they lived in Paris and spent even more time with the couple after their return to England in 1895, by which time Beatrix was seriously ill with cancer. Shortly before Beatrix died, in May 1896, the artist made Rosalind his ward.\n\nThis portrait of Rosalind Birnie Philip can be dated to January or February of 1896, when she frequently sat by her sister\u2019s bedside, first at De Vere House and then at the Savoy Hotel. The image had certainly been transferred and proved before March 7, when the Fine Art Society sold an impression of the lithograph to Whistler\u2019s friend Arthur H. Studd.\n\nNeedlework clearly demonstrates the distinctive quality of the new white transfer paper that the Ways first sent to Whistler in October 1895, while the artist was working in Lyme Regis, Dorset. The paper\u2019s texture so closely resembles the grained surface of a lithographic stone that, in the case of this image, it is difficult to distinguish the original portrait as drawn on transfer paper from subsequent alterations made directly on the stone. Nevertheless, close scrutiny reveals that the artist did make revisions on the stone, especially in the sitter\u2019s face, behind her head, and along the right side of her dress [see fig. 149a]. No impressions have been located to indicate what the drawing looked like prior to these changes.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (294 \u00d7 210 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 228 mm), signed, with black-crayon additions in the sitter\u2019s hair and left sleeve, and inscribed verso, probably in Edward Kennedy\u2019s hand, worked on in pencil by W; SC, cream laid paper (309 \u00d7 210 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3), ivory laid paper (296 \u00d7 211 mm); cream laid paper (255 \u00d7 182 mm); cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 221 mm). London: BM, ivory wove proofing paper (277 \u00d7 208 mm).
