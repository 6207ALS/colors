    "short_description": "<p>Cascades of white pigment rhythmically stream across the panels of a pair of folding screens. Under a combination of white light and UV lighting, the works evocatively express the force and motion of falling water. These enchanting painted screens are the work and a gift of Senju (born 1958), a contemporary proponent of Nihonga, traditional Japanese painting. Known for his signature <em>Waterfall</em> works, Senju created the panels on view at the Art Institute specifically for the museum\u2019s Gallery 109, the space designed by architect And\u014d Tadao.</p>",
