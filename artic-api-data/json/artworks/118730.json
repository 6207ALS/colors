    "description": "<p>When Matta presented his concept of psychological morphology to the Surrealists during the autumn of 1938, an uncomprehending Andr\u00e9 Breton requested that he put his ideas in writing. The resulting text, entitled \u201cMorphologie psychologique\u201d (cited in Paris, Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019arte moderne, <em>Matta</em>, 1985, exh. cat., pp. 30\u201331), shows that one of his sources was Salvador Dal\u00ed, whose own passionate interest in morphology was expressed on a number of occasions in the Surrealist journal <em>Minotaure</em> (see, for example, \u201cPremi\u00e8re loi morphologique sure les poils dans les structures molles,\u201d <em>Minotaure</em> 9 [1936], pp. 60\u201361). Morphology \u2013 the study of the structures, homologies, and metamorphoses of form in animals, plants, and even language \u2013 was a natural arena for the Surrealists and a rich source of inspiration for the visual artists associated with the movement. Broadly speaking, rather than pursuing the moral and psychological implications of Dal\u00ed\u2019s division of forms into hard and soft, Matta tried to convey a maximum conflation of forms, an idea expressed in the characteristic linguistic mergings and neologisms of his writing: \u201cthe object, at each risk of interpenetration may oscillate from pointvolume to momenteternity, from attractionrepulsion to pastfuture, from lightshadow to mattermovement\u201d (Matta, \u201cMorphologie psychologieque,\u201d cited in Paris 1985, p. 30). Not only figures and objects, but also space and time are convulsed and pulsate in this new \u201cgraphique des transformations\u201d (graphic art of transformations; ibid.).</p><p>Matta absorbed ideas from many sources. He was influenced by Albert Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity and by the Russian mystical philosopher P. D. Ouspensky\u2019s <em>Tertium Organum</em> (1911), which Matta and Gordon Onslow Ford read at the same time (see Paris 1985, pp. 27\u201328). Ouspensky defined four stages of spiritual development related to different perceptions of spatial dimension. He described the fourth and highest stage of perception in terms that must have appealed to Matta\u2019s interest in space as a psychological dimension: \u201cA feeling of four-dimensional space. A new sense of time. The live universe. Cosmic consciousness. Reality of the infinite\u201d (Ouspensky, cited in Charlotte Douglas, \u201cBeyond Reason: Malevich, Matiushin, and Their Circles,\u201d in Los Angeles County Museum of Art, <em>The Spiritual in Art: Abstract Painting, 1890\u20131985</em>, 1986\u201387, exh. cat., p. 187). There are echoes of all these sources in Matta\u2019s short text, \u201cMath\u00e9matique sensible \u2013 architecture du temps,\u201d a response to Le Corbusier\u2019s <em>Math\u00e9matique raisonnable</em>; in it he proposed architectural spaces and objects formed and deformed by human psychological needs and desires, rather than conditioned by rational and utilitarian considerations. Matta described the unexpected psychological dimensions of soft spaces: \u201cWe need walls like wet sheets which lose their form and wed our psychological fears\u201d (Matta Echaurren, \u201cMath\u00e9matique sensible \u2013 architecture du temps,\u201d <em>Minotaure</em> 11 [Spring 1938], p. 43). Matta and Onslow Ford were also fascinated by the mathematical objects photographed by Man Ray, which were included in the <em>Exposition surr\u00e9aliste d\u2019objets</em> at the Charles Ratton Gallery, Paris, in 1936 (Paris, Mus\u00e9e national d\u2019arte moderne, <em>Andr\u00e9 Breton: La Beaut\u00e9 convulsive</em>, 1991, exh. cat., p. 302, ills.), and which Breton described on this occasion as \u201csurprising concretizations of the most delicate problems of geometry in space\u201d (ibid., p. 229). But it was not a matter of simply translating scientific, pseudoscientific, or mystical ideas into visual form. Matta\u2019s psychological morphologies and \u201cinscapes\u201d are essentially visual: only on canvas can these mental and physical universes come into being.</p><p>The two-stage process that led to paintings such as this was described by Onslow Ford in relation to a canvas closely related to the Bergman painting, now known as <em>Morphology of Desire</em> (1938, Gordon Onslow Ford, on deposit at the San Francisco Museum of Art; Paris 1985, pp. 90\u201391, ill.), but reproduced in 1939 as <em>Morphologie psychologique 37</em> (Andr\u00e9 Breton, \u201cDes tendences les plus r\u00e9centes de la peinture surr\u00e9aliste,\u201d <em>Minotaure</em> 12\u201313 [May 1939], ill. between pp. 17 and 23): in the first stage, \u201cthe canvas was begun with multicolored marks of the palette knife and the rapid manipulation of paint, to create in a few minutes an automatic base. <em>Second stage</em>: the automatic ground was considered at leisure and, over days and weeks, the subject took shape [<em>s\u2019esquissa</em>] in the painting and was brought to light to reveal a gelatinous field of blue-space-time-matter where a drama was played out between personages and objects\u201d (Onslow Ford, in Paris 1985, p. 29). In the Bergman painting, Matta has only lightly worked over the initial automatic manipulation of paint, compared to other paintings of the period: sexual imagery is visible in male and female forms (for instance, the vertical shape at right and the opening at lower center), and other objects are faintly detectable, such as a tree at upper left and a female profile at lower left. These readings are not intended as definitive, for the configurations in this and other paintings of the period are meant to remain ambiguous. Rather, they are indications of the complexity of Matta\u2019s imagery, which shifts freely between abstraction and the figurative evocation of objects, people, and landscapes; it was in the tension between these modes of representation and the ensuing images that the \u201cjamais vu\u201d (the never seen), as Onslow Ford recalled (in ibid., p. 28), might be found.</p><p>\u2014 Entry, Dawn Ades, <em>Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago</em>, 1997, p. 188-89.</p>\n",
