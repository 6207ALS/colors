With the financial assistance of his independently wealthy friend, the artist Gustave Caillebotte, Monet rented a ground-floor space at 17, rue Moncey in Paris to use as his studio. The apartment was conveniently located just a few blocks from the Gare Saint-Lazare, the terminus for the Normandy rail line that serviced Argenteuil. Although Monet continued to live and work in Argenteuil, he began to commute into Paris more often, with the station connecting his home life and the business of art found in the city.\n\nThe Saint-Lazare train station was, moreover, equidistant from Argenteuil and the Ch\u00e2teau de Rottembourg, in Montgeron, where the department store owner and art collector Ernest Hosched\u00e9 and his wife Alice owned a country house. By the end of 1876, Monet was finishing a commission for four large, decorative panels inspired by the ch\u00e2teau and the grounds on the property. This project required an extended stay, so Monet likely made periodic trips back to Argenteuil and Paris. It may well have been that the gare took on added significance during this time as the midpoint between Monet\u2019s work on an important commission for Hosched\u00e9 for a generous patron and his own family life, fraught with financial strain and concern over his wife Camille\u2019s declining health.\n\nFollowing the interlude at Rottembourg, Monet began a series of works featuring the Gare Saint-Lazare. Monet had not painted in Paris for several years, and his gradual shift of focus toward the capital coincided with new approaches as well as fresh subject matter. The resolutely urban cityscape was a bracing antidote to the picturesque settings of Argenteuil, which had dominated his oeuvre since his move there. The Gare Saint-Lazare was a bustling hub, then the capital\u2019s largest and busiest station. First opened in 1837, the station had recently been expanded by the newly constructed Pont de l\u2019Europe, an engineering marvel consisting of interlocking bridges stretching over the railway yard, which allowed for increased traffic. A starkly modern addition to the Parisian landscape when it was completed in 1868, the bridge inspired Caillebotte\u2019s large-scale painting Le Pont de l\u2019Europe (fig. 16.1), which would be exhibited along with Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare, in April 1877 at the third Impressionist exhibition.\n\nHaving set himself up in his Paris studio in January 1877, Monet immediately sought official permission to paint inside the station. He seems to have begun work at once upon receiving a favorable reply from the director of the Chemins de Fer de l\u2019Ouest. The conditions inside required dramatically different working methods, and this may account for why he executed pencil sketches in sketchbooks (or carnets), which was unusual for Monet, as he devised solutions to the difficulties involved in capturing the continual bustle of the station. The Art Institute\u2019s painting retains a sketch-like, improvisational, and graphic quality within the overall balanced and highly calculated composition; this is particularly evident in comparison with a related drawing (fig. 16.2 [D153]).\n\nA central lamppost aligns exactly with the apex of the building\u2019s glass canopy, bifurcating the composition in much the same way as the green streetlight does in Caillebotte\u2019s monumental Paris Street; Rainy Day (fig. 16.3), which Monet would almost certainly have known was in progress. With the exception of these topographical elements, however, there is no narrative detail in this liminal space. Monet expressed the breakdown of industrial materials under the weightlessness of clouds and steam in a variety of techniques that ranged from leaving the primed canvas exposed (fig. 16.4) to wet-on-wet applications of dense layers of pigment on top of painted surfaces (fig. 16.5 and fig. 16.6; see also Technical Report).\n\nIn his initial lay-in Monet carefully sketched in the roofline for Arrival of the Normandy Train, leaving in reserve an area for the billows of steam (fig. 16.7). In situ he would have observed the effects of steam against the panes of glass overhead. For the iron armature of the ceiling, seen more precisely delineated in both the version at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay (fig. 16.8 [W438]) and the Fogg Art Museum version (fig. 16.9 [W439]), the artist applied narrow individual strokes of blue and green through still-wet paint (fig. 16.10). Although the gridwork is less visible on the right side of the final composition, the infrared reflectography (IRR) image reveals that it was a part of the earlier conception and was ultimately painted over with thick whitish-gray brushstrokes suggesting smoke and steam (fig. 16.11).\n\nThe art historian Juliet Wilson-Bareau has described Monet\u2019s group of twelve Gare paintings as varying in technique, composition, and canvases or supports. She categorizes them as works executed on previously used canvases; those that appear as single-session sketches, those painted entirely on the motif, and ones \u201cthat seem to hover on the borderline between initial sketch and work in progress.\u201d As mentioned, the Art Institute\u2019s painting is sketch-like, yet the application of paint wet-on-wet and wet-over-dry suggests a process that lasted several sessions (see Technical Report). The picture was probably worked both on site and in the studio, given the subtle but significant changes Monet made on seemingly random areas of the composition. He fiddled with elements on the left, such as the tracks, and altered the amount of detail he wanted to include. The rails were added first, and they continue underneath the pentimento of a whirling pattern of strokes at the foot of the train at left that were painted over; these may have represented the circular front of a train engine (fig. 16.12).\n\nAlthough hardly decipherable in the traditional sense, the workers milling about on the left and the people waiting on the platforms before boarding time are legible. Dark strokes of paint with daubs of reddish-brown suggest flesh sometimes beneath hats and hair (fig. 16.13 and fig. 16.14). Monet indicates gender and style only through silhouettes made up of a few economical strokes, with a male figure in the left foreground sporting a recognizable hairstyle and garments as the lone exception (fig. 16.15). Monet here, as in so many of his post-1860s figure paintings, was drawn to distilling the sensation of modern life in action rather than focusing on the individual, a goal that distinguished him from Realist writers and painters, such as Honor\u00e9 Daumier, for whom the motif of the train represented a social experiment in which different classes were forced to interact. Monet\u2019s indifference to specific individuals is clear in the Chicago version: the intangibles of urgency, deadlines, and speed are visualized with urgent strokes to denote crowds of people poised to move, while the billowing clouds, in shades of bluish-gray, give tangible shape to the suggestion of smoke, steam, and sky suspended overhead.\n\nAt the third Impressionist exhibition, held in April 1877, Monet showed the present painting, along with six other versions of the Gare Saint-Lazare. \u00c9mile Zola commended Monet for having successfully expressed the excitement and energy of the modern train station, \u201cthe rumble of trains surging forward, . . . the torrents of smoke winding through vast engine sheds.\u201d The group as a whole received largely positive reviews, with one critic singling out the Chicago version as \u201cexcellent,\u201d for imparting \u201can accurate, clear impressionism,\u201d and for being \u201cunpretentious and well done.\u201d\n\nOf the seven Saint-Lazare paintings identified as having been exhibited in 1877, Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare bears a more detailed title, specifying both the railway line and its direction. Although not the largest or most finished of those included, it was probably the most \u201clegible to a nineteenth-century viewer of oil sketches.\u201d For this composition, Monet positioned himself inside the station where the Normandy lines pull in, which was also the side closest to the rue d\u2019Amsterdam, the street leading to the boulevard de Clichy and to his studio on the rue Moncey (fig. 16.16).\n\nThe nearest analogue in viewpoint and handling to the Art Institute\u2019s painting is the version now in the National Gallery, London, The Gare St-Lazare (1877, fig. 16.17 [W441]), which was not exhibited in 1877. Both show the arched bays of the parcel depot beyond the roof on the rue d\u2019Amsterdam side of the station; the vaulted rooflines and tracks are seen in a contemporary photograph (fig. 16.18). And both versions are closely related to a drawing from a sketchbook that Monet kept at this time (fig. 16.2).\n\nMonet had realized some success with the gare paintings before the start of the third Impressionist exhibition. Three of the seven had already been sold to collectors, a fact advertised by the inclusion of their names in the accompanying catalogue. By March 1877, he had sold at least four paintings to collectors, including Ernest Hosched\u00e9, who acquired the Chicago painting and two others (Arrival at Saint-Lazare Station [Fogg Art Museum (W439)] and Tracks Coming Out of Saint-Lazare Station [private collection (W445)]), and Georges de Bellio, who purchased The Pont de l\u2019Europe, Saint-Lazare Station (W442) and who would later acquire the Chicago painting as well. Although the group of Saint-Lazare canvases lacks the temporal and iconographical cohesiveness of the series Monet would begin in the 1890s, they mark a new direction for his work that was unprecedented in the history of modern art. Novel too was Monet\u2019s decision to exhibit the Gare paintings together as a group presaging the exhibition strategies he would use two decades later with his series Stacks of Wheat (cats. 27\u201332).  \nGloria Groom, with research assistance by Genevieve Westerby\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare was painted on a pre-primed, no. 25 landscape (paysage) linen canvas. The painting appears to retain its original stretcher. The off-white ground consists of two layers. The painting was built up from a broadly applied lay-in that blocked out the main compositional forms, leaving space in reserve for the large cloud of steam and the skylight in the station roof. Throughout the painting, the brushwork remains open and the compositional forms sketchily rendered. Areas of exposed ground and canvas texture remain visible throughout and are juxtaposed with more fluid, smooth paint applications and areas of thicker brushstrokes and impasto, creating a varied surface texture. Most of the compositional elements were executed with concise strokes of the brush, often worked wet-in-wet. The artist originally included a grid of iron tie rods underneath the right side of the station roof, creating symmetry with the left side. These were subsequently covered by the puffs of gray steam coming from the locomotive below. Painted-over brushwork in the lower left corner, visualized with the aid of infrared reflectography, indicates that the artist made a change in this area of the composition; however, the nature of the underlying form is unclear.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 16.19).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 77 (lower left corner, name in dark purplish-brown paint, year in dark reddish-brown paint) (fig. 16.20, fig. 16.21, fig. 16.22). The underlying paint was dry when the signature and date were applied.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond closely to a no. 25 landscape (paysage) standard-size stretcher (60 \u00d7 81 cm).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 15.7V (0.4) \u00d7 19.2H (1.1) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave match was found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is strong, fairly even cusping along the right edge; cusping on the other sides is absent or very slight.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to aqueous lining applied prior to acquisition of painting in 1933 (see Conservation History). The tacks, spaced approximately 1\u20138.5 cm apart, do not correspond to the cusping along the right edge. The tacking margins could not be fully examined due to the presence of paper edge strips.\n\nOriginal stretching: Spacing of the original tacks could not be determined due to the presence of paper edge strips.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher may be original to the painting. It consists of five members, including a vertical crossbar, with butt-ended, mortise and tenon joints and ten keys (fig. 16.23). Dimensions: stretcher bar width, 6.5 cm; crossbar width, 6.0 cm; depth, 1.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: See above.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nIn UV light, evidence of a light blue fluorescence between the canvas and the ground suggests the presence of an organic layer, possibly glue sizing (fig. 16.24).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that two layers are present. The lower layer ranges from 25 to 100 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from 100 to 125 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 16.25, fig. 16.26). Numerous tiny bubble holes were observed in the ground layer where it is exposed at the edges and also throughout the composition where the paint was thinly applied (fig. 16.27).\n\nWhen the painting surface is observed microscopically, only the upper ground layer is visible. It has a warm, off-white color, with some dark (possibly black) and red pigment particles (fig. 16.28).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains calcium carbonate (chalk), with traces of iron oxide, various silicates, and calcium sulfate. Several intact microfossils were observed in the chalk layer (fig. 16.29). The upper layer contains primarily lead white and barium sulfate (barite), with traces of bone black and iron oxide red, various silicates, silica, calcium carbonate, and calcium sulfate. Barite is present in a wide range of sizes, including very large particles (fig. 16.30). Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nOverall, the brushwork is open and somewhat sketchy, with areas of exposed ground left visible through thinly painted passages and at breaks in the brushstrokes. The composition was laid in using thin layers of paint to block out the main forms. The painting was then built up using smooth, fluid paint applications (fig. 16.31), more-bodied paint and low impasto (fig. 16.32), and lightly dragged and dry-brush strokes that skip across the surface of the painting (fig. 16.33). This range of brushwork creates a varied surface texture, which is highlighted when the painting is viewed in raking light (fig. 16.34).\n\nThe station roof was blocked in using very thin applications of paint in dull hues ranging from dark brown and purple to shades of gray (fig. 16.35). These initial layers were broadly applied but are not continuous, leaving the ground layer visible in places (fig. 16.36). The roof was then built up using deeper shades of blue and green. An area of the right side of the roof was left in reserve for the large cloud of steam, which was painted directly over the ground layer, or in some places, over the initial thin lay-in of the roof structure (fig. 16.37). The panes of glass at the peak of the roof were also painted directly on top of the ground. The linear strokes of the skylight framework were laid in first using thin applications of dark green and blue paint. The glass was then painted using individual strokes of thicker, lead white\u2013rich paint, leaving the creamy white tone of the ground layer visible in places (fig. 16.38). In the space just below the roof, where the grid of iron tie rods appears, some of the pale blue-gray strokes of the steam and the sky were laid down first, including the thick, white, diagonal strokes (fig. 16.39). The iron tie rods were then drawn through the wet paint using a fine brush (fig. 16.40), with additional strokes of steam applied on top. The infrared reflectogram shows that the artist originally painted in some of the iron tie rod grid work under the right side of the roof (fig. 16.41). This was subsequently covered by the billows of steam from the locomotive below (fig. 16.42). The compositional forms are mostly rendered with a few quick brushstrokes, without significant blending, modeling, or articulation of details. The figures, for example, basically consist of long vertical strokes of dark blue and green to denote the bodies, with daubs of warm reddish-brown paint to indicate areas of flesh (fig. 16.43). Only the tall figure in the foreground contains any specificity of detail (fig. 16.44)\u2014his hair, jacket, pants, and left hand are all discernible\u2014but even this was done with a few economical strokes of the brush (fig. 16.45).\n\nThe work contains both wet-over-dry and wet-in-wet paint application. The thinly applied underlayers look like they were dry before the painting was built up, as the ridges of the brushstrokes were not disturbed by subsequent paint applications. Much of the buildup of the painting was executed with localized areas of wet-in-wet brushwork. For example, the foreground lantern consists of a thick lead white\u2013rich stroke, with the metal structure described by subsequent fine strokes of green paint that were dragged through the white (fig. 16.46). Some of the light-colored details and contours of the front of the locomotive were added over the still-wet underlayers, mixing wet-in-wet (fig. 16.47). The foreground consists of thin, relatively flat, opaque layers of light green and gray paint. A few final strokes were lightly dragged over the surface when the underlying layers were already dry. The presence of wet-over-dry paint application at different stages of the painting process indicates that the work was carried out in more than one session.\n\nIn the lower left corner, just above the signature, the infrared reflectogram reveals some sweeping brushstrokes coming from the bottom of the train car, down over the area currently occupied by the rail tracks (fig. 16.48); the texture of the underlying brushstrokes is visible in raking light (fig. 16.49). The brushwork is rather cursory, and it is unclear what the forms represented. When viewed under magnification, some of these brushstrokes are relatively thick and light in hue, containing a high proportion of lead white paint, but other areas were covered by the artist using a slightly different, more brownish-green hue compared to the cooler green of the adjacent platform (fig. 16.50). It seems that the rail tracks were laid in first and that they continue underneath the pentimento. When the area was subsequently painted over, the lines of the tracks were reinforced on top (fig. 16.48). The artist made some small changes in the area of the locomotive. The cloud of steam emanating from the chimney initially covered a larger area but was then partially covered when the chimney was extended in height (fig. 16.51). The roofline of the building behind, on the left side, also appears to have been altered slightly. There is an area of disturbed paint close to the top edge, near the center of the painting, where it appears that the paint was pushed and scraped while it was still soft. Losses in that area were subsequently retouched, possibly by the artist in some places. The retouching was not precisely done and the damage remains visible on close viewing (fig. 16.52).\n\nBrushes, including approximately 0.2 cm, 0.5 cm, and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). There are several brush hairs embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, iron oxides including iron oxide yellow and possibly burnt sienna, vermilion, red lake, viridian, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, and bone black. Examination of the painting under UV light suggests the use of red lake in the signature and the sky.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting is currently coated with a spray application of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA, which was applied in 1961. Yellowed natural-resin varnish residues are visible in the recesses of the paint texture; these residues probably relate to the varnish that was removed in 1961 (see Conservation History).\n\nThere are no records of conservation treatment prior to 1961, however, the painting is currently lined with an aqueous adhesive which was probably applied prior to its acquisition in 1933.\n\nIn 1961, a discolored surface film was removed. A spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied and localized retouching was carried out along the edges. A final spray coat of AYAA was applied.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is lined with an aqueous adhesive and appears to retain its original stretcher. The stretcher has been keyed out, causing the ends of the top and bottom members to project slightly on the left and right sides. The bottom member is slightly bowed. There is a slight bulge at the lower right corner, but otherwise, the canvas is in plane. There is some abrasion in the frame rebate area, as well as embedded wood fibers that are probably related to framing when the paint was still soft. There are a few tiny, old flake losses in the paint and ground layers. Cracking is minimal and very fine. There are a couple of localized areas of drying cracks. Retouching is minimal and is focused mainly along the bottom edge. The synthetic varnish imparts an even surface sheen.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), nineteenth-century (1860/80), wedge-shaped, molding frame capped by a torus with an astragal and ogee sight molding. The frame is water gilded over red-brown bole and burnished on the torus and astragal; all other surfaces are matte. The sides and outside scotia are painted with yellow casein, and the frame retains the original gilding and glue size. The pine molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetail splines. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is scotia side; torus (three-quarter-round); beveled face; astragal; and ogee sight (fig. 16.53).\n\nPrevious frame (installed in the 1960s; removed in 2008): A stylized, mid-twentieth-century, American reproduction of a Louis XVI architrave frame with a small fluted scotia and beaded sight molding and an independent fillet liner with a cove sight (fig. 16.54).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933; removed in the 1960s): The work was previously housed in an early-twentieth-century, Louis XV frame with swept sides and foliate rocaille miter and foliate shell center cartouches, and an independent liner (fig. 16.55).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Ernest Hosched\u00e9, Paris and Montgeron, Mar. 1877.\n\nAcquired by Georges de Bellio, Paris, 1878.\n\nBy descent from Georges de Bellio (died 1894), Paris, to his daughter Victorine (de Bellio) Donop de Monchy and son-in-law Eug\u00e8ne Donop de Monchy, Paris, 1894.\n\nAcquired by Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, around 1899.\n\nAcquired by Paul Rosenberg, Paris, by Oct. 13, 1911.\n\nSold by Paul Rosenberg, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Oct. 13, 1911, for 13,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

See Paul Hayes Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), p. 40.\n\nMonet moved into his studio at 17, rue Moncey, nearby the Saint-Lazare train station, by January 17, 1877, thanks to Caillebotte, who paid the annual rent of 700 francs. See Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 202, citing Monet to Charpentier, Jan. 17, 1877, in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), p. 431, letter 101. Juliet Bareau points out that without a Paris studio, Monet needed a pied-\u00e0-terre, a place to store canvases and work on them during inhospitable weather. See Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet, Monet, and the Gare Saint-Lazare, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Yale University Press, 1998), p. 105. Wildenstein further suggests that Monet used the rue Moncey pied-\u00e0-terre as a place to conduct business with those who were unable to travel out to Argenteuil. See Daniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 125.\n\nPaul Hayes Tucker, Claude Monet: Life and Art (Yale University Press, 1995), p. 91. Monet worked on the Hosched\u00e9 commission for about six months, July\u2013December 1876, resulting in four decorative panels: Les dindons (Turkeys) (1877; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W416]); Coin de jardin \u00e0 Montgeron (The Garden at Montgeron) (1876; State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg [W418]); L\u2019\u00e9tang \u00e0 Montgeron (The Pond at Montgeron) (1876; State Hermitage, Saint Petersburg [W420]); and La chasse (Hunting) (1876; Mus\u00e9e de la Chasse et de la Nature, H\u00f4tel Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud, Paris [W433]). According to Charles Stuckey, Monet was invited to Ch\u00e2teau de Rottenbourg in September 1876 and stayed through December; see Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 201.

Scholarly opinions differs on the nature of the relationship between Monet and Alice during the Ch\u00e2teau de Rottembourg commission. Both Stuckey and Wildenstein suggest that an affair between the two began during this extended stay in Montgeron. Daniel Wildenstein further mentions that the last of Alice\u2019s children, Jean-Pierre Hosched\u00e9 was born nine months later on August 20, 1877; see Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 125. Mary Mathews Gedo rejects this supposition, suggesting that Alice\u2019s strong religious beliefs would have precluded the start of their relationship at this time; see Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 183.\n\nMary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 177.\n\nThe design and construction of the Pont de l\u2019Europe was the joint venture of the Compagnie de l\u2019Ouest and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fives Lill Cail.

Randolph and Dorothy Weaver (Little, Brown, 1962), pp. 174\u201375. According to Jean, when asking for permission to paint the station, Monet told the stationmaster, \u201cFor a long time I have hesitated between North station and yours, but in the end I think yours has more character.\u201d In a letter dated January 7, 1877, Monet mentions that he has had difficulty obtaining permission to paint the Gare Saint-Lazare station.

Randolph and Dorothy Weaver (Little, Brown, 1962), pp. 174\u201375. Jean Renoir relays the (likely apocryphal) story of how Monet worked within the Saint-Lazare train station. According to Jean, after gaining access to the station Monet had trains stopped and platforms cleared, and \u201cthe engines were crammed with coal so as to give out all the smoke Monet desired.\u201d While this story is likely to some extent hyperbole, it is often recounted when discussing the Gare Saint-Lazare group of paintings.

(National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Yale University Press, 1998), pp. 106\u201309. According to John House, Monet likely reused canvases when he was not financially sound, mostly prior to 1880 (see, e.g., The Gare Saint-Lazare, Exterior View; 1877 [W447]), and the \u201cfew traced examples of reused canvases after 1880 were all executed on Monet\u2019s travels, when he would have been more reluctant to scrap abortive starts for fear of being unable to obtain fresh materials,\u201d even though he may have been able to afford to discard canvases.

Claude Monet is the most marked personality of the group. This year he is exhibiting some superb station interiors. One can hear the rumble of the trains surging forward, see the torrents of smoke winding through vast engine sheds. This is the painting of today: modern settings beautiful in their scope.\u201d See Sylvie Gache-Patin, \u201cThe Urban Landscape,\u201d in A Day in the Country: Impressionism and the French Landscape, ed.

Manet had exhibited his own railway painting (1873; National Gallery, Washington, D.C.) at the Salon of 1874 and continued to live on the rue de Rome overlooking the Gare Saint-Lazare. This was not lost on reviewers who commented on the \u201c\u2018School of the Place de l\u2019Europe,\u2019 after the neighbor of M.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nPLM and XRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic and UV examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture for the signature (t) contains red lake, cobalt blue, viridian, and some angular, opaque, black particles (possibly charcoal). Charcoal particles were also detected in several of the paint samples. Although no underdrawing was detected with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination, it is possible that the charcoal particles are associated with limited underdrawing that became incorporated into the paint when painted over. Where charcoal underdrawing was detected in other Monet paintings, the material present was minimal\u2014usually not detectable with IRR\u2014and similar black particles were also observed in the paint samples. XRF analysis indicates that the date contains viridian, cadmium yellow, and cobalt blue. Other pigments may also be present. The paint scraping taken in 1977 was reexamined in 2013.

The ground layer of Monet\u2019s The Gare Saint-Lazare (National Gallery, London [W441]), also painted in 1877, was analyzed by X-ray diffraction and laser microprobe and found to contain primarily lead white with lesser amounts of iron and barium.

See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1158\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Oct. 25, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Aluminum and tin were also detected in association with the red lake in Monet\u2019s The Gare Saint-Lazare (National Gallery, London [W441]), also painted in 1877. See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 201.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, iron oxides, vermilion, viridian, cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, PLM, XRF); red lake, bone black (PLM, SEM/EDX); cadmium yellow (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, ultramarine blue (PLM). Starch particles were identified in many of the paint samples analyzed with PLM and SEM/EDX and were probably added by the manufacturer. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. Paint scrapings taken in 1977 were reexamined in 2013.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under ultraviolet light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections. Samples analyzed from The Gare Saint-Lazare (1877; National Gallery, London [W441]) were found to include linseed oil and poppy oil, alone and mixed together.
