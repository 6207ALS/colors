    "transcript": "<p>Annelise Madsen:  The Patio, Vizcaya was painted at James Deering estate, known as Vizcaya, in Miami, Florida in 1917.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. Sargent did a whole series of watercolors in the spring there, and this is a scene that looks through the central courtyard past these windblown, rich blue curtains towards the bay.<br>Annelise Madsen:  Sargent came to Florida to work on a commission to paint John D. Rockefeller, and after his time working on that commission, he goes to visit his friend Charles Deering, who\u2019s based in Miami, and Deering\u2019s brother James was also living in Miami at work on this grand villa that he called Vizcaya, so Sargent stays in Miami for a couple months and is invited to spend significant time at the villa to paint.</p>\n<p>Sargent was an accomplished watercolorist. A work like The Patio gives us a glimpse of Sargent\u2019s skill in rendering both architecture and gardens and the play of sunlight in shadow through the use of both translucent and opaque washes of watercolor. Sargent said painting a watercolor was making the best of an emergency, and you can see here the way that he is deftly controlling the flow of paint across the paper</p>\n",
