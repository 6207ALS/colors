He had worked happily and productively in Louveciennes until the onset of the Franco-Prussian War, but, by early September 1870, the advance of the Prussian troops toward Paris forced the Pissarro family to flee to the deep countryside near Brittany, where their friend Ludovic Piette had a large farm. Julie Vellay, Pissarro\u2019s partner (and soon his wife), was already eight months pregnant when they fled. She gave birth to the couple\u2019s third child and second daughter, Ad\u00e8le-Emma, in Montfoucault on October 21, 1870. The infant died less than three weeks later and was buried in the Piette family plot on the farm. Pissarro seems to have ceased attempting to join the French army to fight against Germany in response to the repeated pleas of his mother, who insisted that he was not French\u2014Pissarro was, in fact, a Danish citizen until his death\u2014and thus should not put himself in harm\u2019s way. Camille, Julie, and their children fled France in early December 1870 to the comparative safety of England.\n\nPissarro thrived in Britain. He spoke fluent English, and his mother, half sister, and brother-in-law were already living there, in the London suburb of Upper Norwood, which had a relatively large Jewish population. The family lived first in the neighboring suburb of Lower Norwood, but shortly after their arrival moved to a small house or apartment at Canham\u2019s Dairy on Westow Hill, which was a short walk from the famed Crystal Palace (see fig. 4.1 and fig. 4.2). Early in 1871 the family moved again, this time to another house in Upper Norwood at 2 Chatham Terrace, where Pissarro painted his second view of this remarkable structure, a smaller painting that focused on Isambard Kingdom Brunel\u2019s spectacular water towers rather than the Crystal Palace itself (fig. 4.3 [PDRS 184]). Pissarro was familiar with glass buildings of this type, having attended the Paris Expositions of 1855 and 1867, and he clearly felt the need to record this marvel of modern architecture and symbol of contemporary life in an equally modern manner. The Crystal Palace was designed and built in a very short period for the first World\u2019s Fair, 1851\u2019s Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations (\u201cThe Great Exhibition\u201d), held in Hyde Park. The work of Joseph Paxton, it was dubbed the \u201cCrystal Palace\u201d by the editor of Punch, Douglas Jerrold, for its iron-and-glass structure. In 1854, after the exposition closed, it was dismantled, enlarged, and re-erected on a permanent basis in Upper Norwood, attracting visitors from all over the world. The move was financed by railroad companies, which had constructed two new stations in the formerly sleepy suburb to bring tourists from central London. This development made Upper Norwood a perfect place to find short-term housing and to travel easily back and forth to the center of the city.\n\nPissarro must have begun to paint immediately upon his arrival in England because two works, a snowy landscape and an image of Upper Norwood, were included in the catalogue of an exhibition organized by the Paris dealer Paul Durand-Ruel at the German Gallery (168 New Bond Street), which opened on March 6, 1871\u2014less than three months after he moved to London. Indeed, once the Pissarro family was settled, Camille, stimulated by the change of scenery, took almost immediately to the outdoors to set up his easel. The present work undoubtedly dates from those months because it was painted in a spot on the main road in front of the Crystal Palace (see fig. 4.1 and fig. 4.4). In Fox Hill in Upper Norwood, Effect of Snow (fig. 4.5 [PDRS 180]), the houses of the well-to-do appear to be clearly situated atop a hill, as the road winds down to the foreground of the picture, reaching its apex in the midground. All is serene except for three people on the road: a man in a top hat walking up the hill, away from the viewer, and a pair of women in what seem to be dresses, shawls, and hats (indicative of a cold winter day) approaching the bottom of the slope, toward the viewer. Many of Pissarro\u2019s Louveciennes landscapes feature similar perspectives and depictions of dusty roads.\n\nBy contrast, the Art Institute\u2019s painting of the Crystal Palace, also viewed from Fox Hill, likely features a busy Upper Norwood boulevard, with well-heeled Londoners and tourists strolling during a cool but sunny spring afternoon with a breeze strong enough to make the multicolored flag stand out against the icy-blue clouds and minty-green glass of the Crystal Palace. The composition emphasizes the human population and the domestic architecture of the area more prominently than the Crystal Palace itself. Fox Hill and its surrounding areas in Upper Norwood clearly housed southeast London\u2019s wealthier classes, as attested by the well-dressed families, horse-drawn carriages, baby strollers, clean streets, and neatly trimmed vegetation flanking the stone wall. Pissarro\u2019s decision to paint the Crystal Palace as a part of the neighborhood instead of as the focal point of the work likely stemmed from his being a resident of the area. In April 1892 Charles Saunier described Pissarro\u2019s 1871 works featuring London\u2019s suburbs in the Revue ind\u00e9pendante: \u201cCamille Pissarro visited London and strove to communicate the novel charm of the aristocratic English countryside.\u201d It is clear that the artist, despite living near a marvel of modern architecture, strove to convey something closer to home with his multiple views of Fox Hill and its inhabitants. He worked on a pre-primed canvas possibly purchased from a London artist\u2019s supply shop, most likely when he was in the company of his friend Claude Monet, who spoke no English and relied on Pissarro to translate. Indeed, Monet used a pre-primed and stretched canvas made from the same bolt of linen when he left London for Holland in 1871 (see Weave in the technical report). The Crystal Palace was painted over an apparently short period of time in three or more working sessions, with time to dry between each campaign (see Paint Layer in the technical report). The building is summarily but accurately painted, recording the walkway on top of the central nave in dark paint separately from the vaulted facade, which appears in shadow (fig. 4.6). The vast water tower, which Pissarro was to paint a few months later from the family\u2019s second home in Upper Norwood (fig. 4.3), appears through the glass nave, with its shadow falling near it. Even the flagpole and its immense, unidentifiable flag can be seen in old photographs and illustrations of the building (fig. 4.7, fig. 4.8 and fig. 4.9), suggesting that Pissarro was faithful to all the main aspects of his view.\n\nPissarro emphasized the human population on the large road in front of the building by letting the glass structure almost disappear into the cloud-filled sky. He chose the effet of a cold, blustery morning, during which the sun has managed to peak brightly through the clouds, casting almost caricatural shadows, such as those of the family on the sidewalk on the right side of the composition (see fig. 4.10). Oddly, other figures have no such strong shadows, indicating that Pissarro painted them at different times or under different light conditions. Looking carefully at this suburban landscape, we can count more than forty figures, several horses, open and closed carriages, and a pram. All of this activity highlights both the presence of the tourist attraction and the fact that there was a railroad station just beyond the houses on the right (see fig. 4.11).\n\nThis picture may easily be considered Pissarro\u2019s earliest cityscape and scene of modern life. Although he had painted scenes of Paris at least twice before, these are set in Montmartre and are essentially un-peopled. The only precursors of The Crystal Palace in his oeuvre are his many representations of the relatively busy route de Versailles in Louveciennes, on which the family had lived for a little more than a year before going to London. Yet this French street was decidedly more rural, and in several of Pissarro\u2019s depictions of it (see fig. 4.12, fig. 4.13, and fig. 4.14 [PDRS 138, 140\u201341]), there are more agricultural carts pulled by farm horses and older black stagecoaches than fashionable leisure equipment and fancy baby carriages. On the other hand, in the London picture there is an undeniable sense of modernity, and the women are fashionably dressed in ways that were completely new for Pissarro\u2019s landscapes. As such, the work relates more to the 1867 paintings of Paris by Pissarro\u2019s friends Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir than to anything in his own career. The canvas also looks forward to the later urban landscapes painted in Paris (see cat. 13; The Place du Havre, Paris; 1893), Rouen, and the port cities in the north of France.\n\nCommentators have long noted that Pissarro effectively deemphasized the Crystal Palace in favor of the masonry walls and houses across the street from it. This has been seen as a kind of pictorial repudiation of the very modernity that the artist attempted to describe, as Pissarro also painted a locomotive cutting through a hilly green English landscape and was, even later in his career, rather fixated on depicting smokestacks and factory chimneys, also major signs of cultural change. It is safe to assume, as Joachim Pissarro has asserted, that the artist\u2019s works took a resolutely modernist turn during his short stay in London, prompted by his consideration of the revolutionary symbol of the railroad in modern paintings and its connotations of industrialization and cultural progress. In much the same way, Pissarro\u2019s two views of the Crystal Palace\u2019s glass-and-iron structure represent an imposing symbol of progress, this time in modern architecture.  \nRichard R. Brettell\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Pissarro began this composition with a charcoal or black chalk underdrawing on a standard-size, commercially primed canvas with a white, three-layer preparation. Evidence of the underdrawing is somewhat visible in infrared examination and in small gaps in the paint layer, but the thickly modeled upper layers obscure the bulk of it. The absence of large compositional changes and the clarity of the composition in X-ray and transmitted-infrared examination suggest that the artist executed a full underdrawing, including some of the large figures and even their shadows, before painting. Pissarro appears to have reinforced this drawing with beige or buff underpaint along the edges of forms, painting up to but not over the original drawing. After laying in flat planes of color throughout, he finished the composition in a series of wet-in-wet campaigns, working large areas of the canvas, such as the sky, in a single session. Changes to the composition include moving the right edge of the Crystal Palace slightly to the left during the execution of the sky, and making small adjustments to the horse-drawn carriage at left and some of the gabled buildings at right. The artist also appears to have painted out shrubs and other green foliage in favor of individual tree branches at the far right. The tree branches themselves appear to be some of the last additions to the work, as the paint catches only the high points of the dried brushstrokes beneath. The painting is currently lined, with the original tacking margins removed, and varnished.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 4.15).\n\nSigned and dated: C. Pissarro 1871 (lower left, in warm-gray paint) (fig. 4.16 and fig. 4.17).\n\nFlax, commonly known as linen (estimated).\n\nThe original size of the canvas is not clear, as the edges were trimmed in a previous conservation treatment (see Conservation History), but the current size is 47 \u00d7 73.2 cm. This most closely corresponds to a no. 20 seascape vertical (marine basse) standard-size (72.9 \u00d7 48.6 cm) canvas.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 14.0V (0.5) \u00d7 15.5H (0.6) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread-count match between this painting and Claude Monet\u2019s Windmills in the Westzijderveld near Zaandam (1871; Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) was identified.\n\nAs the tacking margins were removed as part of an earlier conservation campaign (see Conservation History), much information about the canvas itself and its original stretching has been lost. The warp-angle map (fig. 4.18) shows rather uneven cusping of the vertical (warp) threads on either side of the work, while the weft-angle map (fig. 4.19) shows a pronounced downward distortion of the horizontal threads toward the lower corners of the painting. This downward pulling is also discernible in the X-ray. The warp-angle map also highlights deformations in the upper left quadrant; looking closely at the X-ray in this area, there appear to be a number of weft thread repairs, possibly the result of small tears in the canvas in this area (fig. 4.20). As the ground and paint layers seem unaffected, it is likely this occurred before the canvas was primed. Since the canvas is commercially primed and now lined, it is unclear how visible this defect would have been, or whether Pissarro would have noticed it when he purchased the canvas.\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting was restretched and the tacking margins removed when it was lined at an unknown date. The stretcher does not appear to be original and may date from this lining (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 4\u20137 cm apart on the sides and about 10 cm apart on the top and bottom.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with vertical crossbar. Depth: 2.3 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Unknown.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground is a three-layer commercially applied preparation that is smooth and moderately thick, ranging from approximately 45\u2013115 \u00b5m in thickness. The chunky, lowest layer is highly irregular and may have been applied primarily to fill in the canvas texture. The middle layer contains particles of varying sizes but is relatively even in overall thickness, while the top layer contains the finest particles and appears the smoothest (fig. 4.21).\n\nThe ground appears almost white in stereomicroscopic examination, with a few dark particles visible (fig. 4.22). In cross-sectional analysis, the lowest layer of the ground appears almost brown; this color is the result of the composition of the ground and saturation by the medium and possibly the lining material. The middle layer of the ground appears slightly off-white, while the thin upper layer is white (fig. 4.23).\n\nThe ground is a three-layer commercial preparation: the lowest layer is predominantly chalk (calcium carbonate) with minor amounts of lead white, barium sulfate, silica, and bone black; the middle layer is a mixture of lead white and chalk with small amounts of barium sulfate and trace amounts of silica and bone black; and the top layer is predominantly lead white with trace amounts of silica and barium sulfate. The binder of all layers is estimated to be oil.\n\nInfrared examination indicates that Pissarro executed a contour sketch directly on top of the ground outlining the architecture (fig. 4.24). At left, he began with long, straight lines that establish architectural perspective. The presence of thin paint along the edges of forms and the absence of major changes in the X-ray and transmitted infrared suggest that, although it may be obscured in infrared and microscopic examination, the other features in the painting, including the larger figures, houses, and architectural elements at the right, were also sketched prior to execution (fig. 4.25). The opacity and pigments of subsequent paint layers mask the full extent of compositional planning.\n\nDue to the thickness of the paint, the underdrawing is mostly obscured and has been picked up in the application of subsequent paint layers throughout. Small skips in the paint layer reveal that the underdrawing in the architectural forms at left was done in charcoal or black chalk; it is unclear wether it was applied dry or in a fluid medium (fig. 4.26).\n\nWhile there are changes between the planning and painting stages, there do not appear to be pentimenti within the drawing (see Paint Layer).\n\nPissarro began this composition by reinforcing and in some cases altering the shapes established in the black contour drawing with buff-colored paint (fig. 4.27). This underpainting is particularly visible in the upper sections of the Crystal Palace itself, in the gray-blue area at the horizon, and in the pyramidal tops of the posts along the sidewalk at right. The reinforcing of contours appears to extend to the very inside edge of the drawn lines in the palace but not to cover them, and it served to solidify the perspective, sometimes through subtle changes such as those on the far left of the composition. After this reinforcing, the artist then began to lay in these spaces in relatively flat, opaque paint layers; the painted shapes come up to but not over the drawn lines, creating a characteristic effect visible in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images: the edges of forms appear in stark contrast to the forms they surround due to the thinness of paint over the drawn lines (fig. 4.28). The initial laying in of colors appears to feature tones that are slightly muted versions of the local colors later used to model the forms. Once the upper paint layers were added, the gaps between compositional elements were closed, and almost none of the ground or original black drawing was left visible.\n\nThe X-ray and transmitted infrared images reveal slight changes to the composition. The right edge of the Crystal Palace once extended slightly past its current right edge toward center; to alter the profile of this building, Pissarro simply painted over the edges with additional sky paint.\n\nThe horse-drawn carriage at left appears to be a late addition and was originally slightly closer to the viewer; the transmitted-infrared image shows a confusing array of thin strokes in the vicinity of the horses\u2019 legs. Between the somewhat monochromatic laying in and wet-in-wet modeling stages, the eaves below the gabled roofs at right were diminished, and the full foliage at the far right was replaced by a bare, more minimal treatment of the branches. In the X-ray, the eave of the right building and its left edge appear further to the right, while in transmitted infrared, the left edges of both buildings appear further to the left and the eaves lower and less prominent. The far right trees appear as generalized shapes in the X-ray and are underpainted in a brownish-gray color applied with a wider, flat-tipped brush (fig. 4.29); these directional strokes are still visible in raking light in both the trees right of center and the tree at the far right edge that has been largely painted out. They were initially constructed as solid masses, as if there were leaves present, in a style more akin to the treatment of the shrubs in front of them. As Pissarro modeled the buildings at the right, covering much of these early shapes, he replaced them with individually articulated, leafless branches. At the far right, the X-ray also shows curvilinear forms that suggest additional shrubs; in some areas, muted green paint is visible beneath the reddish-brown color of the buildings (fig. 4.30).\n\nThe X-ray and infrared images also make clear which features in the painting were determined earlier and which were added at later stages. In addition to the buildings, the horizon line, most of the trees and shrubs at the right, the group of larger figures in the right foreground and their shadows, both horse-drawn carriages at left, and the two women pushing the stroller left of center, were all established very early in the process. The edge of the sidewalk at right and its angle into space, as well as the lampposts, appear to be part of the upper layers, although the technical images reveal no obvious changes to their placements. The rest of the smaller figures and the adjustments to the horse-drawn carriage at right were executed on top of the preexisting sidewalk; looking at the area in raking light, the thick, directional strokes of the sidewalk clearly pass under the figures at left (fig. 4.31).\n\nMuch of the upper modeling was executed wet-in-wet over preexisting drawing and underpainting. As mentioned above, the underdrawing, the underpainting, and the borders between compositional elements are almost entirely covered in these stages. This late phase also included the changes to the profile of the Crystal Palace, the horse-drawn carriage at left, and the articulation of many of the smaller figures throughout the foreground. Looking closely at the edges of forms, it seems that although Pissarro worked broad areas in a single sitting, the upper layers were completed in a series of steps. The clouds and sky, for example, were executed after the foreground and appear to have been brought around, and sometimes partially over, the various buildings. The paint is relatively thick, with a paste-like consistency that often retained the mark of the flat-tipped brushes Pissarro favored in many areas (fig. 4.32). The stiffness of the paint is apparent in passages where the underlying paint was somewhat dry and the artist dragged a brush across the surface, catching only the high points of the ridges beneath; the tree branches, added as an almost last step, were executed in this way (fig. 4.33). In some areas, the artist may have added a small amount of medium or spirits to thin the paint sufficiently to lay flat, adding new colors to existing layers and creating vibrant wet-in-wet swirls (fig. 4.34).\n\nMostly flat brushes, with strokes up to 1.0 cm wide.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, emerald green, viridian, ultramarine blue, bone black, vermilion, red lake, iron oxide red and/or yellow, zinc yellow, chrome yellow, and possibly chrome orange.\n\nAlthough the palette seems subdued, the painting features complex mixtures throughout. Most colors are mixed with white, illustrating the tonally unifying effect of peinture claire. Looking at the dark green at right under the microscope, for example, black, yellow, and red particles are clearly visible (fig. 4.35). A bluish-gray tone indicating the silhouetted buildings along the horizon contains primarily lead white and zinc white, with some ultramarine blue and vermilion, small amounts of red lake, and a trace of bone black (fig. 4.36).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an overall synthetic varnish that was applied in 1974 to replace a discolored natural-resin varnish. It is, however, unclear if that varnish was original; as the painting had been lined and heavily retouched, it is likely that that varnish dates from previous restoration. It is unclear whether Pissarro would have varnished this painting.\n\nThe painting was examined in June 1970 and found to be wax-resin lined and stapled to a five-member keyable stretcher with ten keys. At this time it was also noted that the tacking margins had been removed in previous treatment, the paint layer was abraded and cracking with active cleavage and flake losses, and there was also much overpaint and a heavy discolored natural-resin varnish. In 1974 the work was treated and active flaking consolidated. The painting was also cleaned of its varnish and overpaint and given a synthetic varnish (polyvinyl acetate AYAA, followed by inpainting, a layer of methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA).\n\nThe painting is currently wax-resin lined and planar; the tacking margins were removed and the lining canvas is stapled to a five-member keyable stretcher with a vertical crossbar. The painting has a long history of overall cracking, cupped paint, flake losses, and cleavage, seen in the raking-light image (fig. 4.37). The lifting paint appears to be an inherent problem caused by poor adhesion between the ground and paint, coupled with ground cracking. There is an overall network of cracks, many with raised edges, and periodic losses throughout. One larger loss of note is in the rectangular building in the blue-gray area near the horizon line. A few minor losses are retouched, as is the cut edge around the perimeter. The painting was previously noted as having a great deal of overpaint; residues may be present, especially in the gray-blue band near the horizon line at center and in the clouds near the top. There is some blanching, especially in the clouds; it is unclear wether this blanching is associated with the varnish or the paint layers. The work has an overall synthetic varnish that imparts some saturation and an even gloss, with residues of an older, discolored varnish in the interstices of the paint, and many cotton fibers adhered to the surface.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French, Louis XIV, ogee frame with lambrequin corner and rosette-and-shell center cartouches connected by c-scrolls and floral and foliate ornament, and a leaf-tip sight molding. The frame has water gilding, with oil gilding on the sanded frieze, over red-brown bole on gesso. Very little of the original gilding survives, as large portions of the frame have either been regessoed or overgilded; the frieze, for example, has an additional layer of sanded gilding over the original. The original carved oak moldings are mitered. The frame was resized for this painting by cutting and shortening the vertical legs on each side of the center cartouche. The oak moldings were planed flat on the back and glued to a back frame. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is fillet; ovolo with running ovate; scotia side; ogee face rounded over at the perimeter and quirked at the interior, with projecting lambrequin corner cartouches on a diamond bed with punched centers, and rosette-and-shell center cartouches on a plain bed, connected by c-scrolls and floral and foliate ornament on a quadrillage bed; ovolo; sanded frieze; and ogee sight molding with leaf-tip ornament on a straight-lined bed (fig. 4.38).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1967): The work was previously housed in what appears to have been a late-nineteenth- or early-twentieth-century reproduction of a Louis XIV ogee frame with projecting corner and center cartouches and connecting ornament and an independent liner (fig. 4.39).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired by Charles J.

The Art Institute currently uses a title that is based on the title given to the painting when it was exhibited in 1901 at the International Exhibition in Glasgow, Scotland.

According to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 364, cat. 6 in the exhibition was Crystal Palace, Upper Norwood [c. 1871; private collection, London (PV 107; PDRS 184)]. Furthermore, PDRS, vol. 1, p. 362, does not identify which painting was exhibited as cat. 7 [Upper Norwood, Crystal Palace, temps de neige]. It is possible that the Art Institute\u2019s painting was exhibited as cat. 7. Given the lack of leaves on the trees and the cloudy, windy sky depicted, the descriptive aspect of the 1894 title\u2014temps de neige (snowy weather)\u2014might be applicable to the Art Institute\u2019s picture. The exhibition catalogue does not include exhibition dates, but according to PDRS, vol. 1, p. 364, the exhibition was held March 3\u201321.)  \nMay 2, 1901: Crystal Palace (International Exhibition, Glasgow, 1901: Official Catalogue of the Fine Art Section, exh. cat.

The view in fig. 4.3 is from the top of the very steep Fox Hill, possibly from the end of Auckland Road, affording sweeping views of London and toward Kent. This is the same Fox Hill that Pissarro depicted in fig. 4.5. The Pissarros moved from Canham\u2019s Dairy to 2 Chatham Terrace on the south side of the Crystal Palace Park, a short distance from their original Upper Norwood residence. The Crystal Palace was also clearly visible from Chatham Terrace. See PDRS, vol. 2, p. 158.\n\nSee PDRS, vol. 2, p. 158.

Pissarro exhibited two works in 1871 in Durand-Ruel\u2019s first exhibition of the Society of French Artists, which opened on December 10, 1870. According to Shikes and Harper, Pissarro had two works at Durand-Ruel\u2019s second hanging of the same show on March 6, 1871. The catalogue lists no. 38 as A Snow Effect and no. 41 as Upper Norwood. These were the first works that Pissarro exhibited outside of France, and they mark the beginning of a business relationship with dealer Paul Durand-Ruel that would become crucial to the Impressionists several years later, starting with Pissarro\u2019s first solo show in 1883, and continuing when the dealer exhibited some Impressionist works in Boston at the International Exhibition of Art and Industry to stimulate demand for their \u201cnew painting\u201d outside of Europe. The titles of the Pissarro works in Durand-Ruel\u2019s March 6, 1871, catalogue are vague, and they could correspond to his other views of London. For additional comments on the two works Pissarro exhibited at Durand-Ruel\u2019s in March 1871, see Kathleen Adler, A Time and a Place: \u201cNear Sydenham Hill\u201d by Camille Pissarro (Yale University Press, 2011), p. 35 n. 32.\n\nSee Ralph E. Shikes and Paula Harper, Pissarro: His Life and Work (Horizon, 1980), pp. 89\u201390; PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 128\u201329. Interestingly, in PDRS, vol. 2, pp. 153\u201354, Pissarro and Durand-Ruel Snollaerts described this winter scene in southeast London as set in Upper Norwood and showed a map clearly depicting a hill with medium-to-large houses. Shikes and Harper, on pp. 89\u201390, call this same work Lower Norwood, Effect of Snow, perhaps under the impression that the downward slope toward the viewer represents the proverbial \u201cbottom of the hill,\u201d or Lower Norwood. See also PV 105, vol. 1, p. 93, in which the painting is titled Lower Norwood, Londres, effet de neige (Lower Norwood, London, Effect of Snow).\n\nSee Kathleen Adler, A Time and a Place: \u201cNear Sydenham Hill\u201d by Camille Pissarro (Yale University Press, 2011), pp. 24, 40.\n\nFor Fox Hill and the Crystal Palace area, see Kathleen Adler, A Time and a Place: \u201cNear Sydenham Hill\u201d by Camille Pissarro (Yale University Press, 2011), pp. 20\u201321, 57, 59. The London suburb of Upper Norwood was an upper-class neighborhood that by the late 1870s had grown into a district of villas and detached and semidetached cottages, giving it the charming character about which Pissarro fondly reminisced in 1902. For Pissarro\u2019s memories of his stay in London thirty years earlier, see also Camille to Lucien Pissarro, \u00c9ragny, Nov. 13, 1902, published in Janine Bailly-Herzberg, ed., Correspondance de Camille Pissarro, vol. 5, 1899\u20131903 (Valhermeil, 1991), pp. 282\u201383, esp. note 2 of this letter. The area is much hillier than the surrounding districts; in fact, the spot on which the Crystal Palace sits, atop Sydenham Hill, is one of the highest points in the area, at 367 feet. It offers views of Upper and Lower Norwood, Dulwich, Penge, Sydenham, Gypsy Hill, and Anerley.\n\n\u201cEn 1871, Camille Pissarro visite Londres, il s\u2019ing\u00e9nie \u00e0 rendrele charme frais des aristocratiques paysages anglais.\u201d Quoted in PV, vol. 1, p. 94; translation by Elpida Vouitsis, PhD candidate, University of Texas, Dallas.\n\nFor Pissarro\u2019s stay in London and other French artists fleeing there because of the Franco-Prussian War, as well as Monet and Pissarro\u2019s friendship while in London, see PDRS, vol. 1, pp. 128\u201332.

For the confusion related to the December 1870 and March 1871 Durand-Ruel exhibitions of Pissarro\u2019s works, see Ralph E. Shikes and Paula Harper, Pissarro: His Life and Work (Horizon, 1980), p. 91. Pissarro exhibited two works in 1871 in Durand-Ruel\u2019s first exhibition of the Society of French Artists, which opened on December 10, 1870. According to Shikes and Harper, Pissarro had two works at Durand-Ruel\u2019s in this same show on March 6, 1871. The catalogue lists no. 38 as A Snow Effect and no. 41 as Upper Norwood. The titles of the Pissarro works in Durand-Ruel\u2019s March 6, 1871, catalogue are vague, and they could correspond to his other views of London.

According to PV, vol. 1, p. 94, cat. 107: vol. 2, pl. 21, cat. 107, the distant view of the Crystal Palace with its imposing tower in the background (no. 107) was first exhibited in March 1894.

(Museum of Modern Art, New York, 1973), p. 167.\n\nJoachim Pissarro has commented, \u201cDespite the severe circumstances during his seven months in London, Pissarro could have hardly been more inventive, more pictorially daring, or more broadminded. It was in London that Pissarro\u2019s work took a resolutely modernist turn.\u201d See Joachim Pissarro, Camille Pissarro (Abrams, 1993), pp. 258\u201363. For some of Pissarro\u2019s, Monet\u2019s, and Renoir\u2019s urban scenes, see Richard R. Brettell and Joachim Pissarro, The Impressionist and the City: Pissarro\u2019s Series Paintings, ed. MaryAnne Stevens (Dallas Museum of Art/Philadelphia Museum of Art/Royal Academy of Arts, London, 1993), pp. xvi, xxiii, xxv, xliii, xlvii, 10\u201312, 18, 53\u201357, 62\u201363, 66, as well as many other examples in this catalogue of Pissarro\u2019s late urban scenes, which depict the busy comings and goings of urbanites.\n\nJoachim Pissarro, Camille Pissarro (Abrams, 1993), pp. 80\u201386.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests the signature is a complex mixture containing black, iron oxide brown, and a mixture of lead and zinc whites. The presence of iron, lead, and zinc was confirmed with XRF. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 5, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nDue to the absence of tacking margins (see Conservation History), the canvas was not analyzed. The estimation of linen is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique. All canvas paintings by Pissarro that were analyzed as part of this study were found to have a linen support.\n\nThere is no documentation of the lining, or the painting\u2019s pre-lining measurements. The 1939 catalogue raisonn\u00e9 lists the work as 48 \u00d7 73 cm, but the dimensions in this publication appear to be rounded to the nearest whole cm. Cusping visible in the X-ray is less pronounced on the top and bottom, suggesting this dimension may have been shortened slightly. Two closely related works, The Avenue, Sydenham (1871; National Gallery, London [PDRS 188]) and Lordship Lane, Dulwich (1871; Courtauld Gallery, London [PDRS 189]), show many similarities in technique and were also painted during Pissarro\u2019s stay in London; they measure 48 \u00d7 73 cm and 45 \u00d7 73 cm, respectively. As the current state of preservation of these related works is not known, it is not clear wether the dimensions of these paintings may also have changed due to past treatment, including lining, but it seems likely that all three paintings would have been the same standard size. See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), pp. 136\u2013141, cat. 5; and Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 1.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Lefranc et Cie in 1863, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 45, fig. 30. The tacking margins and possibly some of the composition were trimmed in a previous treatment (see Conservation History) and as a result the original size is unclear.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, The Crystal Palace (PS183/1972.1164),\u201d Dec. 2013.\n\nSee Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, The Crystal Palace (PS183/1972.1164),\u201d Dec. 2013. This suggests that the canvases for these two paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See also Don H. Johnson, \u201cPissarro-Monet Canvas Match,\u201d Sept. 2013.\n\nThread repairs to the canvas before priming discovered by Don H. Johnson, e-mail communication, Aug. 26, 2013. Warp and weft thread angle maps included in Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Camille Pissarro, The Crystal Palace (PS183/1972.1164),\u201d Dec. 2013.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including a glue lining and removal of the tacking margins. In part because of the absence of the tacking margins, there were no available samples that included the ground and canvas. Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in commercial preparation, and a thinly applied sizing could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 2, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThis is the approximate ground thickness in samples examined by SEM/EDX. The ground may have different thicknesses in areas that were not sampled. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 2, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. The presence of lead, calcium, and barium was confirmed with XRF and SEM/EDX. SEM/EDX also detected silica and bone black. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 5, 2013; Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 2, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 3.\n\nA closely related painting from the same year, Lordship Lane, Dulwich (1871; Courtauld Gallery, London [PDRS 189]), appears to have underdrawing in charcoal in a fluid, possibly oil-based medium. See Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 7.\n\nA faint line parallel to and above the roofline of the Crystal Palace is visible in the infrared images but, as there are no visible architectural features corresponding to this height, the line can be interpreted as a perspective or guiding line rather than part of the underdrawing.\n\nThis blocking in of initial forms and reinforcing of the underdrawing in buff-colored paint was also noted in The Avenue, Sydenham (1871; National Gallery, London [PDRS 188]). See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 136.\n\nPigments identified by techniques: lead white, zinc white, emerald green, viridian, bone black, vermilion, iron oxide red and/or yellow, chrome yellow (XRF, SEM/EDX); ultramarine blue, zinc yellow (SEM/EDX). Red lake was identified as having a tin substrate by SEM/EDX.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nIt is possible that this painting contains the lead white and zinc white mixture found in other Pissarro works throughout the 1870s and 1880s. Bomford first observed, \u201cThis [mixture of lead- and zinc-based whites] is most likely to be a paint manufacturer\u2019s mixture: there would be no reason for Pissarro himself to combine the two pigments, and artist\u2019s tube paints consisting of several different whites and inerts were marketed in the second half of the nineteenth century.\u201d See David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 66. For a table of paintings in other collections in which this mixture was found, see Lydia Gutierrez and Aviva Burnstock, \u201cTechnical Examination of Works by Camille and Lucien Pissarro,\u201d Art Matters: Netherlandish Technical Studies in Art 5 (2013), p. 4, table 2. This mixture was also identified in Snow at Louveciennes (c. 1870; cat. 3), Young Peasant Having Her Coffee (1881; cat. 10) and, Haymaking at \u00c9ragny (1892; cat. 12).\n\nAs chrome yellow and chrome orange share the same chemical makeup, they are not distinguishable by elemental analysis alone and must be visually differentiated based on their color. The presence of chrome orange in a sample from the present painting was based on the simultaneous identification of lead and chromium by XRF and SEM/EDX, along with visual observation of the orange color of the inclusions. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 5, 2013; Pozzi, \u201cPsro\\_CrystalPalace\\_1972\\_1164\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d June 2, 2014, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nPigments identified by SEM/EDX.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Pissarro\u2019s technique and published analyses of Pissarro\u2019s paintings.

Galloway, Catalogue of Paintings and Drawings at Thorneyholme, Cheshire, Collected by Charles J. Galloway (G. Galkner, 1892), opp. p. 94 (ill.); p. 20, cat. 49. According to the catalogue (p. 2) all pictures that are marked with an A were purchased directly from the artist. The Art Institute\u2019s painting is listed as cat. 49, and no A accompanies the catalogue description, so it is likely that Galloway did not purchase the paintingdirectly from Pissarro. According to John Rewald \u201c140 Years, One Man\u2019s Faith,\u201d Art News 42, 2 (Dec. 1\u201314, 1943), pp. 23\u201324, the painting was purchased from the artist by Paul Durand-Ruel in 1871 while both were in London, and that this painting was Durand-Ruel\u2019s first purchase from the artist. According to Hayward Gallery, Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,Pissarro: Camille Pissarro 1830\u20131903, exh. cat. (Arts Council of Great Britain/Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1980), p. 82, cat. 15 (ill), this purchase directly from the artist by Durand-Ruel cannot be substantiated. See also John House, \u201cNew Material on Monet and Pissarro in London in 1870\u201371,\u201dBurlington Magazine 120, 907 (Oct. 1978), pp. 636\u201342; in which House discusses Pissarro in London and Durand-Ruel\u2019s initial purchases from the artist. For House (p. 638), based on the titles recorded by Durand-Ruel, \u201cit seems unlikely that Pissarro showed or sold . . . either of his Crystal Palace views (PV 107 and 109); he may have felt that less overtly modern subject matter stood a greater chance of success.\u201d\n\nSee Christie\u2019s, Catalogue of the Important Collection of Modern Pictures and Water Colour Drawings of Charles J.

According to Hedberg the painting was sent to the Art Institute on May 19, 1970, and was returned to Hirschl and Adler on October 14, 1970. This is consistent with receipt of objects 23263 (on file in Museum Registration, Art Institute of Chicago), which indicates that the painting was at the Art Institute for consideration for purchase by May 20, 1970.\n\nSee Greg Hedberg, Hirschl and Adler, to Gloria Groom, e-mail correspondence, Dec. 1, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe painting was given to the Art Institute of Chicago in undivided fractional interests beginning in 1972.
