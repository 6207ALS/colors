This sheet is a single-figure study for the first of these, which depicts the peace treaty that Pope Alexander III and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa reached in Venice in 1177. The corresponding painted figure can be seen in the large crowd at right in the fresco.</p>\n<p>An example of the artist\u2019s mature draftsmanship, the drawing demonstrates a range of techniques, from the carefully modeled face and the crumpled pleats of the sleeve to the delicate black chalk of the figure\u2019s beard.</p>\n",
