    "description": "<p>This serpentine-front bomb\u00e9 chest, one of only six known, is an exceptional example of this rare form, and it has retained its original finish and brasses. Though seemingly plain in design, the bomb\u00e9 chest was quite complicated and costly to produce because it took an excellent craftsman to curve the drawer sides, mahogany front, and the interior dovetail joints to match the swell of the case. While most American furniture forms were derived from European sources and were disseminated throughout the colonies, some forms like the Boston bomb\u00e9 chest are now known to have been produced only in their specific regions.</p>\n",
