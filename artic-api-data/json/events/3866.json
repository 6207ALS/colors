    "description": "<p>Art Insights provides a historical and enlightening art-enrichment experience for older members of the community who are unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected (formerly Senior Center Without Walls) to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based Art Insights conversations on a national scale. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>This program shows how artists from the Ancient Greeks to the modern masters have depicted the cultivation, preparation, and enjoyment of comestibles. Works by artists such as Winslow Homer and Vincent van Gogh depict the origins of the delicacies that grace our tables. Norman Rockwell, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Roy Lichtenstein portray food and the gourmands who eat it. Decorative arts, both ancient and modern, showcase the dining experience, traditions, and customs associated with eating, drinking, and being merry.</p><p>This virtual presentation is hosted by Well Connected (formerly Senior Center Without Walls), a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who connect via phone- or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p><p>><strong>*For more information or to register, please call (877) 797-7299 or visit <a href=\"http://www.seniorcenterwithoutwalls.org/\">SeniorCenterWithoutWalls.org</a>.</strong>Art Insights is generously funded by the Hulda B. and Maurice L. Rothschild Foundation.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an email to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
