    "description": "<p>Paul Strand spent the summer of 1916 at his family\u2019s cottage in Twin Lakes, Connecticut, attempting to give his understanding of Cubist art\u2014abstraction through fragmentation, multiple points of view, and a reduction of people and objects to basic geometry\u2014a photographic form. Strand made several radical choices in this work: he abandoned the traditional, upright perspective of the photograph; caused the table to appear tipped, as if to suspend its utilitarian function; deployed shadows to create powerful compositional diagonals; and suggested objectivity in the crispness of his negative and print. When <em>Porch Shadows</em> appeared in the final issue of <em>Camera Work</em>, it was a clear signal of a new aesthetic. As Strand wrote, true modernists should avoid all \u201ctricks of process or manipulation\u201d to celebrate photography\u2019s inherent qualities as art.</br>For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: <a href=\"http://media.artic.edu/stieglitz\">The Alfred Stieglitz Collection</a>.</p>\n",
