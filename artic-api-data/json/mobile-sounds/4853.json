    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: What\u2019s the first thing you notice about this sculpture? Is it the shape? Or maybe the details of the lines? If I told you that this bronze sculpture was made using a blanket, would you believe me? Well it\u2019s true! And that\u2019s pretty amazing, right? That something solid like metal can have the look of something delicate like cloth. The way that artist Hannah Hiersekorn did that is actually by using something very special to her.</p>\n<p>Hannah: This bronze piece is a casting of my great nana's quilt, which has been sitting on the bed of the matriarchs of my family for generations, and it was passed down to me in mostly tatters, so I decided to memorialize that quilt in bronze.</p>\n<p>Narrator: To begin, Hannah dips the quilt in wax, which makes it more stiff so she can drape it into the shape that you\u2019re touching now. From there she adds several layers of a slurry, basically a mix of sand and water that coat the waxed quilt.</p>\n<p>Hannah: Once it\u2019s completely dry you put it in the kiln at about 1600 degrees and it vitrifies the shell, melts out the wax, and burns the quilt.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Did you catch that? Hannah had to destroy the quilt in order to create this sculpture. See, vitrify basically means that the slurry hardens into a mold through heat, but in the process the quilt burns away. I don\u2019t know about you, but I think that makes this piece really powerful.</p>\n<p>Before Hannah can pour metal into the mold she just made, she has to test it for cracks.</p>\n<p>Hannah: We tap the mold with a metal rod and listen very carefully. And if that sound is dull or flat that means there\u2019s a crack somewhere and you have to go and find it. And if that sound has a nice ringing tone to it then it\u2019s clear and ready to go.</p>\n<p>Narrator: To melt the metal you use this huge furnace which is heated by adding gas and air. You need the temperature to be just right, and the way an artist does that is actually by tuning the furnace by sound, almost like an instrument.</p>\n<p>Hannah: Yeah, the sound is magic. There\u2019s this hum from the furnace. It\u2019ll have this low hum and then it will jump up in pitch and then you know you\u2019ve hit the sweet spot and that it\u2019s the perfect environment in the furnace for melting metal.</p>\n<p>Once the metal is melted, you take the shell out of the kiln, put it into position, and pour metal into it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing quite like pouring metal. I mean molten bronze is like looking at the sun. It\u2019s brilliant and glowing, and it\u2019s just amazing to think about these elements that are put together, elements from the earth\u2019s crust, from the earth\u2019s core with iron, and making those into whatever shape you want is incredible.</p>\n<p>Narrator: As the bronze as it cools the mold begins to crack</p>\n<p>Hannah: as it cools and contracts it\u2019ll break the ceramic mold and it will make this kind of \u201cping, ping\u201d sound as like the ceramic shell ejects itself off the metal as it shrinks.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Once the metal has completely cooled, you knock off any remaining mold that\u2019s attached and you pretty much have your sculpture.</p>\n<p>Something that makes bronze sculpture unique is that an artist has to think a lot before doing any metal pouring. It\u2019s not like painting or weaving where you might work on it for while, come back, when you pour metal you\u2019ve pretty much one chance the nail it.</p>\n<p>Hannah: It makes me very hesitant to make work. And it requires for me a lot of discernment and careful thought about what I\u2019m going to create in that it will be there after I\u2019m gone for generations. And that\u2019s important for me too in creating objects and thinking about them in ways as they last, you know? What do I want to last past my lifetime?</p>\n<p>Narrator: You can find bronze artworks across the museum, from the lions on the front steps to the galleries of Ancient Chinese Art, to the architectural fragments in the second level of the Grand Staircase. It might look durable but bronze can be harmed by touching, so remember to explore with your eyes and imagination when looking at works of art in the galleries.</p>\n",
