    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This sideboard was made around 1880 in a style called Modern Gothic, so called because its forms were inspired by Medieval motifs.  The rich ornamented surface includes images of game birds and stylized cat tails.  The subject of the hand carved elm and walnut panel on the left and right cabinet doors is the story of the Fox and the Stork from Aesop's fables, it is a tale of false generosity in which the fox invites the stork to dinner and offers her clear broth in a shallow bowl.  Because of her long beak, she cannot eat her dinner, in return, the crane invites the fox to supper and serves the meal in a jar with a long neck which the fox cannot access.  Imagine this story on a piece of furniture intended for a dining room where dinner plates and eating utensils would be stored.  This hand worked sideboard is part of a late 19th Century English and American reform movement, sometimes called the Aesthetic movement, its artists promoted the integrity of hand work against anonymous industrialized production and the educational role of art in the home which they hoped would foster a moral society.</p>\n",
