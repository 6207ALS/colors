It was finally transferred and printed in February 1904, when the Goulding firm pulled a small edition. Although never processed during Whistler\u2019s lifetime, the drawing for Nude Model on an Empire Sofa can nevertheless be dated with some certainty to the late autumn of 1893. It relates directly to The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72), the transfer lithograph that Thomas Way printed in November 1893 for publisher Andr\u00e9 Marty\u2019s L\u2019Estampe Originale. The same model appears in both images, posing on the distinctive sofa that was part of Whistler\u2019s studio furniture in Paris. The model\u2019s pose in the two images is quite similar, and Whistler seems to have had difficulty rendering the young woman\u2019s left arm in both drawings. It is apparent, too, that the model seen in these two lithographs is the same one who posed for another lithograph, Nude Model, Reclining (cat. 73).\n\nAlthough the transfer drawing for this lithograph suffered some deterioration during the eleven years between its creation and its processing, it is clear that it was drawn on the same fine-grained transfer paper that Whistler used for The Draped Figure, Seated. He made considerable use of the stump in this image, although some of its delicate marks have weakened and appear gritty.\n\nRosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s records documenting the dates and edition sizes of Goulding\u2019s posthumous printings of Whistler\u2019s lithographs are, for the most part, well organized and easily understood, but this transfer drawing was entered twice in her ledger. On page 47 Birnie Philip squeezed a notation \u201cno. 5. 10 prints Stone destroyed/ Nude on Empire Sofa\u201d into a list of \u201cuntried drawings.\u201d In fact, Nude Model on an Empire Sofa was not an \u201cuntried drawing,\u201d her designation for a drawing on stone that had never been printed, but rather an \u201cuntried transfer,\u201d an unprocessed drawing on transfer paper. Apparently realizing that her notes were confused, she rewrote the entry for this lithograph on pages 50\u201351. There she had ample space to enter the information on Goulding\u2019s edition systematically, correcting the designation for this image to read \u201cFifth untried Transfer / Carmen on Sofa Feb. 17th 1904 10 proofs Stone destroyed.\u201d Birnie Philip\u2019s entries for Nude on Empire Sofa and Carmen on Sofa thus refer to the same drawing. Knowing this, we can identify the model who posed for this rare lithograph, as well as for the better known Draped Figure, Seated and Nude Model, Reclining, as the youthful Carmen Rossi, one of Whistler\u2019s favorites.\n\nWashington: FGA, cream laid paper (329 \u00d7 209 mm); NGA, grayish ivory laid paper (312 \u00d7 193 mm).  \nNesta R.

Birnie Philip\u2019s confusing double listing of Nude Model on an Empire Sofa, as well as her mistake in first putting it with \u201cuntried drawings,\u201d quite understandably led Margaret MacDonald to the conclusion that the entries referred to different images when she published the inventory in Print Quarterly in 1988.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 71, only state.
