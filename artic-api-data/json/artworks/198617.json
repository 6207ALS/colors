    "description": "<p>Ilse Bing\u2019s career reflects the freedoms photography offered women in the early twentieth century. Born in Germany, Bing moved to Paris in 1930, where she contributed to the emerging picture press and made her career alongside Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz, Man Ray, and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Dubbed \u201cQueen of the Leica\u201d for her mastery of the new handheld 35mm camera, Bing combined trenchant observation with dizzying viewpoints, off-kilter angles, and abrupt cropping. She particularly liked the experimentation necessitated by working at night: this otherworldly image from her Paris streetlights series, for example, uses darkroom solarization (partial reversal of light and dark tones) to heighten an atmosphere of mystery. Photography editor Emmanuel Sougez wrote in 1934 that in Bing\u2019s work we can see \u201ca magic halo, an enchantment surrounding reality.\u201d</p>\n",
