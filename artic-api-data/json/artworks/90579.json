    "description": "<p>Known as an innovative abstract painter, Barnett Newman made a small but significant body of sculptural work, from which Lace Curtain for Mayor Daley stands out as uncommonly literal and blatantly political. Newman made this sculpture in the fall of 1968 for an exhibition organized by Chicago\u2019s Richard Feigen Gallery as a forum for artists to protest the brutal treatment of anti\u2013Vietnam War demonstrators during the previous summer\u2019s Democratic National Convention, which was held in Chicago. Richard J. Daley, then mayor, was largely seen as responsible for the violent police tactics deployed. What Newman called a \u201cLace Curtain\u201c is in reality a hefty screen constructed from barbed wire and splashed with bloodred paint.</p>\n",
