The two were not originally together and have since been separated (see Technical Study). Decades before the Art Institute acquired this double-sided ledger sheet, a previous owner, for reasons that remain obscure, glued its long side to the corresponding side of another double-sided drawing from the same sketchbook (cat. 33). This conjunction was not Gauguin\u2019s intention, and Art Institute conservators separated the sheets (see Technical Study). As the various orientations of the motifs on both sides of the sheet indicate, Gauguin turned the piece of paper as he worked, drawing in any available space. This suggests that he was sketching spontaneously, interested in capturing a pose or movement. This was a common practice for Gauguin during his first trip to Tahiti (1891\u201393), when he was especially intent upon familiarizing himself with his new environs and the way of life he found there.\n\nThe images on the recto suggest that Gauguin may have been observing several animals of the same species or one animal as it moved around (see the various renditions of a pig, for example). The motifs on the sheet\u2014in addition to the pigs, there are dogs, goats, horses, and a cow (along with a profile of a man\u2019s head)\u2014served a practical purpose in the development of fuller compositions, as was the case with much of his sketchbook imagery. Animals featured in many of his works depicting rural France that date before his arrival in Tahiti (see fig. 34.2 [W 160, W 2002 191]), and he would continue to expand his repertory of them in subsequent years. Accordingly, sheets such as this may have aided the genesis of Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Three Huts (fig. 34.3 [W 471]) and even later compositions such as his 1897 Tarari maruru (Landscape with Two Goats) (fig. 34.4 [W 562]).  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">This sheet was removed from a rather large ledger book, the size of which was more conducive to record keeping than to extemporaneous plein air sketching. The sheet was likely still bound in the sketchbook when Gauguin left it with Francesco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio before returning to Tahiti in 1895. By the time the sheet was sold to Walther Geiser in 1931, it had been removed from its binding and paired with and adhered to a companion sheet of studies from the same volume (cat. 33 [Rewald 35]), then framed (see Provenance). Two distinctive hands have inscribed their numbers to this sheet and its companion as well as to twelve additional works in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. These numbers correspond to the list presented in the Salon d\u2019Automne\u2019s 1906 4me exposition: Catalogue d\u2019ouvrages in which \u201ctrois albums avec croquis\u201d (\u201cthree albums with sketches\u201d) from the Durrio collection are prominently listed.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the sheets may have been consecutive pages when bound and, once disbound, were stacked one on top of the other. There is a significant loss in this sheet (fig. 34.5). When the loss is positioned and aligned with a similarly large area of accumulated surface dirt on the verso of the companion sheet, they correspond exactly in size, shape, and orientation (fig. 34.6). The diagonal creases in both sheets match exactly when this sheet is skewed diagonally 4 mm clockwise and placed atop the companion sheet to align the creases (fig. 34.7). It appears that as the pages were removed from the sketchbook, their order was retained in a stack, one in which one sheet was placed atop and askew of the other for a significant period of time during which surface dirt settled on the exposed area of the underlying sheet.\n\nGauguin summarily drew a series of graphite sketches of various animals including goats, pigs, dogs, part of a horse, and the small profile of a man on the front of this sheet. There is no clear sheet orientation, and forms are drawn both vertically and horizontally as if the artist shifted the position of the sketchbook as he drew. On the verso, there is a portrait in the upper left that is very similar to those found in the companion sheet from the same volume (cat. 33). Here, however, the artist has refrained from including watercolor washes, while retaining the practice of drawing with a very light touch, then reinforcing his faint lines with more heavily applied graphite. This is apparent throughout but nowhere is it more pronounced than in the feet and torso depicted in the lower half of the sheet. He may have transferred these forms onto another sheet of paper, leaving behind the embossment of that mark making. A now-faded ink also appears in this sheet, but only in the portrait (fig. 34.8). Again, knowing that Gauguin would reopen his sketchbooks onto random sheets time and time again, the forms that surround the portrait are likely later additions.\n\nThe paper is typical of a type that was often bound into Gauguin\u2019s sketchbooks\u2014poor-quality, thin, smooth, moderately sized, machine-made wove stock conducive to working in inks and watercolors, or with charcoal, chalk, crayon, and graphite. Under ultraviolet light, the sheet fluoresces a dull yellow. This fluorescence is common among the various sketchbook sheets examined and is likely attributable to the aged gelatin sizing used in the manufacture of the papers. The paper fibers appear evenly distributed when the sheet is viewed in transmitted light. As a result of overexposure to light, the once-cream paper has now discolored to tan.\n\n320 \u00d7 217 mm\n\nWhen this sheet was adhered to its companion sheet from the same sketchbook (see cat. 33), it was mounted along the right edge of what has now been identified as the verso, over the left edge of the recto of the companion sheet, framed\u2014perhaps in anticipation of the 1928 Basel exhibition (see Exhibition History)\u2014and exposed to light on what then became the recto of the larger, paired sheet. This exposure contributed to the significant darkening of the sheet tone on one side and likely contributed to ink fading as well.\n\nWhile significant fading and color change of inks are primarily the result of overexposure to light, it is also possible for materials to alter with changes in the pH of their environment. Gauguin\u2019s ink, one that was possibly aniline purple when he picked up his pen to draw with it, has changed considerably. As the poor-quality paper became more and more acidic with age, the acidic environment that developed in turn caused the ink to alter to the pale-yellow tone seen today. Before 1916, when Fran\u00e7ois Antoine Vizzavona photographed the sheet that once adjoined this one, the inked lines were still robust and maintained a significant compositional presence in the drawing (see cat. 33, fig. 33.10).\n\nAs noted above, at some time after 1906 this and another sheet from the same sketchbook were adhered together along a vertical edge to form a single sheet that measured 320 \u00d7 437 mm. Reports written in 1995 and 2002 address this large, paired sheet. In 2015 the sheets were separated. This was done by brush applying a minimal amount of water to the one-eighth-inch area of overlapping paper to soften the adhesive and release the sheets. Further treatment followed to stabilize the sheet and its companion.\n\nIt was not until in-depth study and extensive research were undertaken for publication that it was determined that the two sheets that originally formed one paired support were not intended to be joined together. Each is a sheet in its own right removed from the same sketchbook, although their exact placement within the bound volume cannot be definitively determined. It appears that the sheets were adhered together some time after Durrio acquired them. He had at least the companion sheet (see cat. 33, fig. 33.10) photographed by Vizzavona; to date a Vizzavona photograph of this sheet has not been located. Archival records provided by the Geiser family indicate the sheets were joined by the time they were listed in his inventory in 1931.\n\nThis sheet was once folded in half through the center on the short side, and an old crease remains. It is in fact this crease that first led to a reexamination of the larger combined sheet. When compared with its companion, the crease in that sheet should have appeared as a mirror image of the crease in this sheet if indeed they had once been folded in four as previously assumed. Instead the creasing was identical, indicating that one sheet had been placed atop the other and the pair folded together along the short side.\n\nThe sheet is extensively foxed and will remain so in order to maintain visual continuity with its companion. Note that there is slight offset of gold paint in the lower right quadrant on the verso. It is tempting to speculate that one day another similar sheet may be found with gold paint that had at one time offset here.  \nHarriet K.

This circle included Francisco Durrio, and the group of images Vizzavona photographed from Durrio\u2019s collection has aided recent provenance, authentication and technical studies. Among Durrio\u2019s group of works by Gauguin, Vizzavona photographed this drawing documenting the single sheet without its companion. For a reproduction and the entry that cites Vizzavona, see John Rewald, Gauguin Drawings, Bittner Art Book (T. Yoseloff, 1958), p. 27, pl. 35. Richard Field believes the works were photographed by Vizzavona in 1910; see Richard S. Field, \u201cGauguin Monotypes,\u201d Print Collector\u2019s Newsletter 3, no. 5 (Nov.\u2013Dec. 1972), p. 97.\n\nIn Walther Geiser\u2019s unpublished inventory number 300 is a double-sided drawing that measured 315 \u00d7 426 mm. He refers to the sheet variously as studies of children and animals (Tahiti . . .) and Kinder, T., and cross-references his entries to the Kunsthalle Basel exhibition, where it is number 143 and entitled Tahiti-Kinder. Note, too, that he likely measured the work in its frame, given the difference in dimensions by 5 and 8 mm, respectively.\n\nSee also cats. 51.2, 51.3, 52.1, 53.4, 54.2, 54.3, 55.2, 56.1, 57.1, 58.1, 59.2, and 82.3.\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Salon d\u2019Automne, 4me exposition: Catalogue des ouvrages, exh. cat.

I am grateful to Mel Becker Solomon for collaborating on these inscriptions and for deducing their connection to this 1906 exhibition. The significance of the second set of inscriptions has yet to be determined, but they undoubtedly have a relationship to the first.\n\nThe ink in the companion sheet (cat. 33) was analyzed in several areas and they did not show any particular elements using XRF. An organic dye such as the popular aniline purple is thus suggested.\n\nFor a reproduction and the entry that cites Vizzavona, see John Rewald, Gauguin Drawings, Bittner Art Book (T.

This was done by brush, applying a minimal amount of water to the one-eighth-inch area of overlapping paper to soften the adhesive and release the sheets. The work was conserved at that time.

I am grateful to Dr. Rudolf Reber for generously sharing his archival documentation with me and providing photocopies to aid in our research for this publication.\n\nA number of early-state impressions on pink paper from Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite have soft, yet clearly visible, folds across the short sides of the sheets (for example, impressions of Noa Noa [Fragrant] in a private collection [see cat. 51], and Nave nave fenua [Delightful Land] in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris [see cat. 56]).\n\nGauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, since the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value since Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti. See Javier Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Miriam Alzuri, and Mar\u00eda Amezaga, Francisco Durrio (1868\u20131940): Sobre las huellas de Gauguin, exh. cat.

Financial troubles forced Durrio to accept the cash deposit from the museum before the conclusion of the exhibition, forfeiting his Gauguin collection as a result. He could not raise the funds in enough time to purchase back his Gauguin collection before it was auctioned off by the Swiss managers of the show. We know nothing of these two people, but one of them could have been the director of the Kunsthalle Basel, Wilhelm Barth; someone with a role in the exhibitons in Basel-Berlin; or someone close to him.
