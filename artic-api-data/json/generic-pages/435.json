The basic form includes seventeen syllables broken down into a 5, 7, 5 pattern over three lines of verse. Haiku poets often write new poems daily to respond to the ever-changing world around them. To craft your own haiku, begin by creating a word bank with five words that describe what you are noticing in your world today. Use one or more of those words to inspire and structure your poem. Try to keep things simple by using the present tense and avoiding similes, metaphors, or fancy adjectives. And, remember, it can be as silly or serious as you choose! Examples of Haiku Five syllables here. Seven more syllables here. Are you happy now? Haiku are easy. But sometimes they don't make sense. Refrigerator.   I Wish I\u2019d Had a Camera Photographer Robert Frank was known for working in the \u201cstreet\u201d style, using his small camera to quickly capture fleeting moments in everyday life. Stylistically, his work was tied to that of his friend Beat poet Jack Kerouac (American 1922\u20131969), who often wrote using stream of consciousness, a way of writing that captures a subject\u2019s thoughts and reactions to an event in a continuous flow. Visualize a moment from your life\u2014a fleeting scene or cherished memory\u2014that you wish you had captured in a photograph. Set a timer for five minutes (or less for younger learners). Without stopping to edit, write a stream of descriptive words that evoke the sights, sounds, and feelings of that moment. Share this written memory with a friend.   Bestseller Margo Hoff\u2019s 1945 painting, Murder Mystery , portrays a reader propped up in bed late at night with their head buried in the pages of a book.

Imagine you are writing a fictional novel that will one day be a bestseller. You think your story is interesting and exciting, but now you need a title. What title would you give your book?

The varied colors and paint strokes in Joan Mitchell\u2019s City Landscape provide us with multiple points of entry and engagement.
