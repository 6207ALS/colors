    "transcript": "<p>Unless noted otherwise, all type in Kruger\u2019s artwork is Futura Bold, a sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner and released in 1927. Based on geometric shapes, it is similar in spirit to the Bauhaus design style of the period.</p>\n<p>Kruger\u2019s Griffin Court installation covers the floor with a printed vinyl that starts where visitors scan their entrance tickets and extends to the glass doors at the opposite end of the court, measuring 30 feet wide to both side walls and 200 feet long. This installation features the phrase \u201cBLIND IDEALISM IS REACTIONARY SCARY DEADLY,\u201d with green X\u2019s crossing out \u201cREACTIONARY\u201d and \u201cSCARY.\u201d Each word in the phrase alternates between white type on a black background and black type on a white background,</p>\n<p>The label for Untitled (Blind Idealism) reads:</p>\n<p>Kruger has reprised the work Untitled (Blind Idealism), adapted from the prose of psychiatrist and political philosopher Frantz Fanon (1925 to 1961). Modifying Fanon\u2019s original \u201cBlind idealism is reactionary,\u201d Kruger\u2019s additional adjectives address the enduring necessity of responding to one\u2019s context\u2014environmental, political, and societal. The artist\u2019s site for this urgent message transfers it from the textual page to a physical, institutional space. Like many of Kruger\u2019s text works, this too has appeared in many other public forums.</p>\n",
