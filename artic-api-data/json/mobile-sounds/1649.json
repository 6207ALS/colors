    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  In 1964, the young English artist David Hockney arrived in California, whose brilliant light, bright colors, and crisp, dark shadows dazzled and inspired him.  This painting depicts the Los Angeles art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman.  Mr. Weisman, standing stiffly in profile, seems to resemble the unyielding abstract vertical sculpture in front of him.  Curator James Rondeau:</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU:  One terrific detail of the painting is that Mr. Weisman's fist seems to be clenched so tightly that it actually is dripping paint down the leg of his pants.  So the artist reminds us not only that the figure is made of paint, but there seems to be a kind of psychological and emotional tension here that is so great that the figure almost seems to be dissolving before our eyes.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  In contrast to her husband, Mrs. Weisman meets her gaze, seemingly very aware that both she and her art collection are on display.  Her frontal pose is reflected by the central sculpted figure by the famous British artist Henry Moore, while her smile echoes that of the slightly menacing face on the totem pole.&quot;</p>\n",
