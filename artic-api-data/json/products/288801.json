    "description": "<p>Scarf developed from Georges Seurat\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Final Study for \"Bathers at Asni\u00e8res\",</em> 1883, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p>\n<p>The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work,&nbsp;<em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em>. Seurat\u2019s focus on a subject from modern life, his luminous palette, and his airy brushwork show how the young artist adapted characteristics of Impressionist painting for his own purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 32 x 55 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Material:</strong> Polyester</li>\n<li><strong>Hand wash, hang dry.</strong></li>\n</ul>",
