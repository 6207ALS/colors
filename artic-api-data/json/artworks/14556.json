Cezanne rendered the unusual perspective\u2014looking down onto the rooftops of Auvers and out to the distant countryside\u2014using blocky, energetic patches of color and areas of ragged brushwork that seem unfinished, especially at the lower left and center. These choices, which were radical at the time, mark his attempt to communicate not merely the landscape\u2019s appearance but also the feeling of seeing it and painting it.</p>\n",
