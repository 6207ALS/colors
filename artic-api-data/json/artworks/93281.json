Jan spent a number of years in Italy as a young man, and there developed a sensitivity for landscape drawing that would remain with him throughout his later career in Antwerp. This sheet, dating from his last year in Rome, demonstrates the artist's ability to reconcile the small and everyday with the grand and sublime.</p>\n",
