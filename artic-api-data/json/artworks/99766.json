    "description": "<p>For approximately thirty years, Joseph Cornell worked in relative obscurity in the basement of his home in Queens, New York, creating a multitude of wondrous miniature worlds within his boxed constructions. Poetic m\u00e9langes of found objects and materials, his deeply personal and elusive work (which also includes many collages on paper) combines the enthusiasms of his childhood\u2014butterflies, marbles, seashells, sky charts, stamps\u2014with adult fascinations such as ballerinas, empty cages, and movie stars. Cornell\u2019s boxes often prompt a dizzying series of associations; in <em>Untitled (Butterfly Habitat)</em>, these include Christmas decorations, collector\u2019s cabinets for specimens, microscopes, natural history displays, sailor\u2019s boxes, and windows. Some of these references are contradictory, reinforcing the work\u2019s ambiguity. Ideas linked to flight, voyages, and the exotic are countered by the rigid and symmetrical organization of the display. The butterflies are not, however, pinned as they would be on a specimen board. Each pane of paint-spattered glass encloses a small compartment with white wood walls in which a cutout of a paper butterfly is suspended with string, allowing for some movement as the box is handled.</p>\n",
