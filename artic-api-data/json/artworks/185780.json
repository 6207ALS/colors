    "description": "<p>Chicago artist Manierre Dawson painted <em>Figure in Pink and Yellow</em> after viewing the Armory Show, an event that affirmed his embrace of abstraction. There is no sense of three-dimensional space, and he has completely fragmented the form of the figure, which is presumably indicated by the lighter hues of lavender, yellow, and peach in the center. Dawson was essentially self-taught as a painter, his interest in abstraction developed during his early training as a civil engineer in which he studied geometry, calculus, and mechanical drawing. He acknowledged the works of Paul C\u00e9zanne as a major influence and was equally indebted to the fractured forms of Cubism.</p>\n",
