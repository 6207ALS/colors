    "description": "<p>The topic for this month's Intersections is <strong>Self Care, or Self Preservation?</strong></p><p>Ranging from yoga retreats to mobile meditation apps, self-care practices have emerged as a popular way to cope with the stressors of the world around us. How do we balance this attention to internal wellbeing with our external roles as citizens and neighbors? Join museum educators Paulina Lopez and Nenette Luarca-Shoaf as we examine the act and outcomes of turning inward.&nbsp;<br><br>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.</p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/search/events?q=%3A+intersections\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an e-mail to <a href=\"access@artic.edu \">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/visit/accessibility\" target=\"_blank\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
