    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This elegant cup was made in England in 1590 by a silversmith who worked for Queen Elizabeth I. It\u2019s elaborate silver gilt cover and stem have set off the ivory surface of a most unusual material, an ostrich egg. Thought to be laid by the mythical griffin ostrich eggs were then highly prized and very costly in Europe. The cup belonged to John Whitfield a wealthy London lawyer connected with the royal court. In fact, the cup may have been given to Whitfield by Queen Elizabeth herself, a silver gilt Tudor rose emblem of her family is mounted inside the ostrich egg. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: What\u2019s doubly interesting about this cup is that it is featured in a painting by the Dutch still life painter Pieter Gerritsz van Roestraten. You see the ostrich cup in amongst a group of other precious objects including a watch, a gold chain, a lacquer box.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The painting dates from about 1670. It was probably commissioned by John Whitfield\u2019s grandson to commemorate some of this family\u2019s most precious possessions and heirlooms.&quot;</p>\n",
