As this video shows, rather than conceiving the composition at once on a single sheet of paper, Ensor drew with a variety of media on fifty-one individual sketchbook pages, developing the composition part by part, and later reworking the drawings to visually integrate the whole.\n\nClick to watch the Technical Video.\n\nThe Temptation was damaged during the Battle of Belgium in 1940, as well as by environmental exposure over time. Conservation of the drawing\u2014documented in this video\u2014involved removing the individual sheets from their mount to reduce staining and repair tears. The sheets were then rejoined again in their original configuration.\n\nClick to watch the Conservation Video.\n\nCareful study of The Temptation\u2019s construction and the way the sheets overlap suggest that Ensor mounted the drawing sheets from the center outward, initially using sketchbook pages cut in half and later incorporating complete folios. This video shows how the drawing might have evolved.\n\nClick to watch the Assembly Video.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\"> Conservation Video Technical Video Assembly Video </section>",
