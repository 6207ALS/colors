    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: These huge hanging aluminum works defy convention and expectation in many ways.  Suspended from the ceiling instead of rising from a plinth as a traditional sculpture would do, they suggest great organic vines.  Their sinuous, spiraling forms, which are made from thin sheets of industrial aluminum, seem both more fragile and more alive than we would expect metal to be.  This organic quality is emphasized by their brightly painted floral designs.  Part of a much larger work entitled &quot;Living Sculpture&quot;, these pieces were made in the 1960s by Marisa Merz. James Rondeau:</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: Marisa Merz belongs to a group of Italian artists who, in the late 1960s, pioneered an artistic movement known as Arte Povera.  Arte Povera, &quot;poor art&quot;, was so named because of the artists' attraction to simple, everyday, or humble materials, both manmade and natural.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Merz made these works to transform her own living and working space.</p>\n<p>JAMES RONDEAU: So these hung from the ceiling in her apartment in Turin, Italy, where she lived and worked.  She was interested in creating an environment that had magical meanings, transforming her living space into a forest or a hive or a cave or even a kind of womb.</p>\n",
