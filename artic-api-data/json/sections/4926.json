A two-part plaster mold would have been made from the clay model, often by a professional mold maker. The model would almost certainly have beendamaged or destroyed when the mold was removed. From this waste mold a plaster of the sculpture was then cast, which, in turn, was then used to make a carefully created piece mold or a flexible gelatin mold. From one of the plaster versions yet another mold would have been made, in this case, a gelatin mold for lost-wax casting. The bronze edition of Seated Nude was lost-wax cast by the C. Valsuani foundry. X-rays of the work show evidence of the casting. Many mold marks are visible on the surface. The sculpture has a slightly reddish-dark-brown [glossary:patina], modulating to warm dark-golden brown at high areas, with areas of dark green.\n\nIncised: HM/8 (proper right, toward back of seat) (fig. 37.1).\n\nBronze (an alloy of primarily copper and tin).A sample was taken for ICP-OES analysis (fig. 37.2).\n\nLost-wax cast in one piece.\n\nC. Valsuani foundry, Paris.\n\nSlightly reddish dark brown, modulating to warm dark golden brown at high areas, with areas of dark green. XRF analysis of the surface indicates that the patina contains chromium, a characteristic of many Valsuani patinas.\n\nThe core has white material with a sandy component, typical of the plaster core usually used in lost-wax casts (fig. 37.3). Mold marks can be seen in many areas, the most prominent of which run up from the proper right front side of the cylindrical seat and continues along the proper right side of the figure. Both forearms also have distinct mold marks in the back view (fig. 37.4 and fig. 37.5). Visible on the underside of the self-base are four large-diameter circular bright-metal shapes near the corners, presumably sprues or risers. Thin rectangular stubs are found near these corner circles and also circling the central opening and smaller leg opening on the underside (fig. 37.3).\n\nX-rays of the object show many foundry plug repairs of casting flaws, especially in the torso, some of which are arranged in lines suggesting the repair of cracks (fig. 37.6). There is a rectangular or cylindrical post or long plug coming down from the top of the proper left elbow. Very thin, long wire core pins extend down from head and neck into torso. Single pins about 2 mm thick and6 cm long are visible in the upper arms, with heads pointing toward the forearms; a pin 3 mm thick and about 7.5 mm long is visible at the area of join of the upper proper left arm with the shoulder, with the head pointing upward. There appears to be a large flaw or intentional opening (perhaps having a straight edge?) at the proper right underarm or shoulder blade. This appears to be partially filled with a lumpy, porous material of a density not dissimilar to the surrounding bronze, alongside a very dense material, perhaps simply a thicker layer of the lumpy substance.\n\nThere is no record of treatment at the Art Institute.\n\nThe sculpture is in sound structural condition. There are a number of small scratches. Greenish and black drip marks are visible at the small of the figure\u2019s back.  \nSuzanne R.
