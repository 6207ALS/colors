As rulers came and went, it was important to announce the transition of power quickly. Since the Mint regularly struck coins to pay the armies stationed throughout the empire, it was easy to change the portrait, revise names in the inscription, and publish the news.<br>During the reign of the emperor Trajan, Rome reached the apogee of its power and territory. Wars of expansion extended the empire from Scotland in the north to Egypt and Gibraltar in the south and east to the Euphrates River. This rare coin was minted during his conquest of Parthia and Armenia. Instead of victory, however, the newly pacified territories soon rose in revolt, ending in Rome\u2019s retreat and Trajan\u2019s death.</p>\n",
