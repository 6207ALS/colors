His burial was accompanied by one of the most magnificent displays of wealth discovered in Greece in recent decades.&nbsp;The character of the objects that followed him to the afterlife prove that this part of Greece, like Mycenae, was being indelibly shaped by close contact with Crete.&nbsp;This was the time of the very birth of European civilization.</p><p>The warrior\u2019s tomb was discovered and excavated in summer 2015 by a team sponsored by the University of Cincinnati. The team included students, professors, and professional archaeologists from a dozen different universities, and represented as many different nationalities.&nbsp;Project co-directors Sharon R. Stocker and Jack L. Davis of the University of Cincinnati note:&nbsp;\u201cThe team did not discover the grave of the legendary King Nestor, who headed a contingent in the Greek forces at Troy.&nbsp;Nor did it find the grave of his father, Neleus.&nbsp;They found something perhaps of even greater importance: the tomb of one of the powerful men&nbsp;who laid foundations for the Mycenaean civilization, the earliest in Europe.\u201d</p><p>This lecture is generously sponsored by the Boshell Family Foundation. </p>",
