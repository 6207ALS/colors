    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Small intricately modeled clocks were among the most difficult forms to create in porcelain. This piece was made in 1725 by the du Paquier porcelain manufactory in Vienna, Austria. It is actually a case made to hold the large onion watch which you see displayed next to it. The clock case has strong connections with domestic design. Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE:  This clock in its structure and overall decoration very much resembles the large ovens that would have been set in the corners of aristocratic rooms to heat the rooms in the winter. And the modeler basically took that form and reduced it to make this tower like clock case. The decoration that you see on the clock particularly that of the eagle standing on a globe and then the profile of a man looking right all have to do with the Hapsburgs who were the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire at this time of which Vienna was the capital city.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The profile is that of that of the Emperor Charles VI who gave the du Paquier manufactory an exclusive patent to produce fine porcelain in 1718.</p>\n",
