    "description": "<p>Julia Margaret Cameron is known for painterly photographic portraits of some of the most celebrated figures in Victorian England and for staged allegorical images drawn from poetry, literature, and the Bible. She began photographing in the 1860s at the age of forty-eight, after being given a camera by her daughter and son-in-law. \u201cI longed to arrest all beauty that came before me, and at length the longing has been satisfied,\u201d she wrote in \u201cAnnals of My Glass House,\u201d an autobiographical essay.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameron exhibited during her lifetime, but she became better known after her death when her works were championed (and reprinted) by <a href=\"http://archive.artic.edu/stieglitz/\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred Stieglitz</a> and his fellow <a href=\"https://archive.artic.edu/stieglitz/pictorialism/\" target=\"_blank\">Pictorialist photographers</a>. Stieglitz published Cameron\u2019s photographs alongside his own and wrote that she was \u201cone of photography\u2019s few \u2018classics.\u2019\u201d Cameron\u2019s photography was further celebrated in a 1926 book, <a href=\"https://artic-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01ARTIC_ALMA2132212150003801&amp;context=L&amp;vid=01ARTIC&amp;search_scope=everything&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;lang=en_US\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Victorian Photographs of Famous Men and Fair Women</em></a>, which featured an introduction by her great-niece, the writer Virginia Woolf.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1949 Stieglitz donated nine prints of works by Cameron to the Art Institute, including portraits of poets <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66838/robert-browning\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Browning</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66865/alfred-lord-tennyson\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a>, and evolutionary theorist <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66869/charles-darwin\" target=\"_blank\">Charles Darwin</a>. Later acquisitions ranged from exquisite single images to a trove of prints sold to the museum by the Cameron family on the occasion of the 1998 exhibition, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/8247/julia-margaret-cameron-s-women\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Julia Margaret Cameron\u2019s Women</em></a>. This show underscored the range of Cameron\u2019s female portraits\u2014variously defiant, forthright, melancholy, or languidly sensual\u2014and celebrated her role as a visionary practitioner.</p>",
