    "description": "<p>After Kurt Seligmann settled in Paris, his sinister, biomorphic compositions gained the attention of Andr\u00e9 Breton, who invited him to join the Surrealist group in 1937. With the outbreak of World War II, Seligmann became the first Surrealist to arrive in New York and was instrumental in the emigration of most of the movement\u2019s leading figures. Transformed by contact with new cultures, Seligmann\u2019s work continued to evolve, and as the Surrealists\u2019 acknowledged expert on magic, he infused his paintings with mythology and esotericism. Indeed, the year he made this work, he published <em>The Mirror of Magic</em>, a history of the occult. The winding forms and mystical quality of this canvas would influence a new generation of American artists, including his student, Robert Motherwell.</p>\n",
