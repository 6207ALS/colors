    "description": "<p>Drawing was a love of Niemeyer from earlier on; as a child he would draw in the air with his finger. It was his love of drawing that led him to architecture and reinforces his belief, as written on this sketch, \u201dwithout drawing architecture does not exist,\u201d that further emphasizes how integral drawing was to the development of his architecture. Niemeyer drew formal inspiration from organic forms in nature, but perhaps most prominent to his inspiration was his love of the female form. It is within the sinuous lines he drew in these figure studies that the formal relationship of the figure to organic shapes of Niemeyer\u2019s buildings are prominent.</p>\n",
