In her right hand, she holds an object, perhaps a breadfruit (a staple of the Tahitian diet), which echoes the form of her breast. Behind her a woman in an identical pareu, but with a white shirt covering her upper torso, crouches low to the ground and averts her gaze. A large green shrub or tree behind them occupies the central part of the image. A densely layered landscape extends into the distance. This composition served to create prints and monotypes, and its unusual appearance, with its flat, broad areas of color outlined in black, is reminiscent of Gauguin\u2019s paintings on windows.\n\nGauguin\u2019s practice of taking counterproofs from drawn and painted matrices is well documented. Using a transfer process, he would repeat images, in identical scale and size, to reproduce the same elements across drawings, wood-block prints, and monotypes. Peter Zegers suggested that, upon Gauguin\u2019s return to France, Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape served as a matrix from which the artist pulled counterproofs. He would carefully cover an existing drawing, such as the present sheet, with a thick coat of aqueous medium, such as gouache, and duplicate the image by using dampened paper to pull faint counterproofs from the covered surface. He employed this method with his pastel Reclining Nude (fig. 64.2), using the work as a matrix to execute counterproofs, an example of which is in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (fig. 64.3 [cat. 70]).\n\nTo make Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape, Gauguin took a graphite drawing enhanced with watercolor and added a layer of gouache to the surface. The application of gouache over the more nuanced drawing that is likely underneath produced a new composition with large areas of solid color, which would readily transfer to another sheet of paper. For instance, the skirt of the standing woman shows that medium was lifted off the gouache matrix when an impression was pulled and transferred onto the dampened paper (see fig. 64.4). Technical findings revealed that there are several layers and colors of gouache present, evidence that Gauguin reapplied media to the drawing repeatedly in order to create multiple new impressions.\n\nZegers also suggested that Gauguin might have used Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape to print monotypes by laying a piece of glass on top of the drawing. Instead of pulling a counterproof directly from the drawing, in these instances he used it as a guide; in this way, he could either copy the image beneath or select certain of its aspects to create a new composition on the surface of the glass (slight variations in impressions often occur due to this shifting of the glass to create new configurations). He would place a dampened piece of paper on top of the glass, which was now covered with wet gouache, and apply pressure to transfer the media onto the paper support. In an 1898 article, Julian Leclercq specifically mentioned this printing method, reporting that \u201cGauguin painted with watercolor on a sheet of glass and pulled impressions on dampened paper.\u201d While no known impressions exist, the simplified, flat areas of color in Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape lend themselves to reproduction in this manner.\n\nA similar work by Gauguin, Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (fig. 64.5), exhibits striking similarities with the Art Institute\u2019s Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape. Like the latter work, Te faruru was also made initially in graphite, after which the artist applied thick layers of watercolor and gouache. In both Gauguin placed multiple layers of dark gouache over lighter ones. In her analysis of the present work, Harriet Stratis found that the mountain\u2014blue with a layer of black gouache on top\u2014displays the same application of paint as found in the window of the hut in Te faruru. Even though the Art Institute\u2019s sheet is neither signed nor dated, its similarities to Te faruru (which bears both the artist\u2019s signature and a date) are enough to suggest that not only did Gauguin likely execute them in Tahiti around the same time but they also figured in a similar reproductive printing process at a later date. No counterproofs of the images exist, which makes it impossible to determine their exact function, but they seem to come from a time that, for Gauguin, was rich in technical experimentation.\n\nThe figures in Two Tahitian Women in a Landscape are found in several of Gauguin\u2019s paintings and drawings from his first stay in Tahiti (1891\u201393). The crouching female first appears in the 1891 painting Black Pigs with Crouching Tahitian (fig. 64.6 [W 445]) in a nearly identical setting\u2014with a central tree situated in front of the same land formations, painted in hues of green, pink, and blue. She seems almost vulnerable, curled up near pigs and wild dogs below a towering landscape. In the 1892 painting Nafea faa ipoipo (When Will You Marry?) (fig. 64.7 [W 454]), she assumes the same position in similar scenery (the mountains are farther back, and the large tree appears to emerge above the hill), and she also wears a white flower behind her ear. A seemingly more mature, fully dressed figure sits behind her and seems to observe her closely, as if offering protection or sage advice.\n\nThe crouching female reappears in several sketches; two are in the Art Institute (fig. 64.8 [cat. 46] and fig. 64.9 [cat. 32]), the first of which is directly related to Nafea faa ipoipo. Two paintings, both entitled Where Are You Going?, feature a standing woman closely related to the one in the present work: she clutches an animal against her legs in one (fig. 64.10 [W 478]), and in the other she holds an identical breadfruit (fig. 64.11 [W 501]). The background figures and landscape in the two paintings are almost the same as those in Two Women in a Landscape. In both the crouching female is relocated to the background.\n\nThe reuse of these figures in different media and in shifting relationships might be explained by Gauguin\u2019s creation of several fictionalized women during his time in Tahiti. Belinda Thomson observed that the artist appeared to gravitate toward the representation, adopted by the Symbolist movement of the mid-1880s (of which he was part), of the female as saintly virgin or wicked temptress. Perhaps Gauguin was addressing this duality in the present image: the seeming vulnerability of the crouching female might connote innocence, while the standing figure could be a variation on the theme of Eve holding the fruit that led to the fall of man. Thomson suggested that Gauguin employed such archetypes to explore concepts of virginity and purity, life and death. The titles that Gauguin gave to Nafea faa ipoipo and Where Are You Going? do little to aid the viewer\u2019s comprehension of these compositions. Christoph Becker suggested that the paintings to which Gauguin assigned titles in the form of questions explore themes of human existence\u2014love, sexuality, jealously, guilt, spirituality, death\u2014in a Tahitian context.\n\nTwo Tahitian Women in a Landscape can also be understood in relation to Gauguin\u2019s experiments in stained glass. In fact, the sheet\u2019s simplified forms, flat areas, and dark outlines could easily be transformed into one of the artist\u2019s paintings on glass (see fig. 64.12). These include windows in his studio in Papeete, which he painted to resemble stained glass (see fig. 64.13 [W, 509]). The artist\u2019s reasons for this were in part practical; his landlady, Madame Charonnier, was a notorious gossip and would look in on his painting sessions (Gauguin often worked from nude models). Also, there was a shortage of canvas. Complaining about this in an 1892 letter to his friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, Gauguin mentioned that he was painting on windows:\n\nThe simple stained glass window attracting the eye by its division of colors and forms, that\u2019s what is best. In a sense music. To think that I was born to work at an applied art and that I cannot succeed. Whether stained glass or furniture, earthenware, etc. . . . These are in essence my aptitudes, much more than actual painting.\n\nGauguin was not alone in being drawn to stained glass as a means of expression. At the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle, where Gauguin participated in an exhibition at the Caf\u00e9 Volpini, the American Fine Arts gallery in the Palais des Beaux-Arts included a section of stained-glass works. Also at the exposition, the American artist John La Farge displayed several stained-glass compositions, for which he won a French Legion of Honor award (see fig. 64.14). Like Gauguin, the American artist traveled to Tahiti, as well as elsewhere in Asia and the South Seas, to expand the horizons of his art. However, while La Farge used more traditional stained-glass materials (leaded glass in various, often brilliant, colors that are soldered together) to create intensely colored, highly decorative compositions, Gauguin opted to paint directly on glass, using a more muted palette for his enigmatic scenes.\n\nOne of Gauguin\u2019s glass paintings, Bare-Breasted Tahitian Woman Holding a Breadfruit (fig. 64.15 [W 552]), which was part of a door, is stylistically similar to his gouache Te faruru. Both depict a single figure in a simplified Tahitian landscape; the figure is similar to the two attendants and angel in Gauguin\u2019s 1892 painting Ia orana Maria (Hail Mary) (fig. 64.16 [W 428]). This suggests that Gauguin worked on the gouaches and glass paintings at the same time in 1891/92. He would complete several more painted windows during this period that relate to Two Tahitians in a Landscape (see fig. 64.17 [W 511]). Like the composition of the Art Institute\u2019s sheet, the painted window Tahitian Woman in a Landscape presents a female crouching on the ground, a pareu around her waist; mountains loom above a large, centrally placed shrub.\n\nWhen considered in relation to the paintings on glass Gauguin was making at the time, the Art Institute\u2019s work assumes a religious undertone. Holding the breadfruit the way Eve holds the apple, the composition\u2019s standing woman finds many an ancestor in medieval stained-glass windows that show Eve offering temptation to Adam (see fig. 64.18). Although a seemingly straightforward representation of two Tahitian women, the Art Institute\u2019s gouache is complex. Whether it served as a matrix for counterproofs or was a study for stained glass, the gouache offers a tantalizing glimpse into Gauguin\u2019s novel approach to artistic practice, as well as his thoughts about female identity and the concepts of innocence and sin.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Francisco \u201cPaco\u201d Durrio (1868\u20131940), Paris, between 1893 and 1895.\n\nEmily Crane Chadbourne (1871\u20131964), Chicago and London, by 1910.\n\nGiven by Emily Crane Chadbourne to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">London, Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, Nov. 8, 1910\u2013Jan. 15, 1911, cat. 185 as Water Colour.\n\nNew York, 69th Regiment Armory, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Feb. 17\u2013Mar. 15, 1913, cat. 179, as Femme et Enfant.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Mar. 24\u2013Apr. 16, 1913, cat. 142, as Woman and child.\n\nCopley Society of Boston, International Exhibition of Modern Art, Apr. 28\u2013May 19, 1913, cat. 59, as Woman and Child.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Loan Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture, June 1\u2013Nov. 1, 1933, cat. 876.\n\nBoston, Institute of Modern Art, 100 Modern Pictures in Water Color, Gouache and Tempera, May 23\u2013July 14, 1945, cat. 20.\n\nNew York, Wildenstein &amp; Co., A Loan Exhibition of Paul Gauguin, for the Benefit of the New York Infirmary, Apr. 3\u2013May 4, 1946, cat. 46.\n\nSan Francisco, California Palace of the Legion of Honor, 19th Century French Drawings, Mar. 8\u2013Apr. 6, 1947, cat. 139.\n\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Gauguin in Tahiti, Apr. 1\u2013May 14, 1950, no cat.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section references\" id=\"references\">Grafton Galleries, Manet and the Post-Impressionists, exh. cat.

(1892 [W 454]), E haere oe i hia (Where Are You Going?) (1892 [W 478]), and Ea haere ia oe (Where Are You Going?) (1893 [W 501]). It has also been argued by Peter Kort Zegers and Harriet Stratis that Gauguin later used this drawing as a matrix to produce monotypes back in France. Richard S. Field, in Paul Gauguin: Monotypes, exh. cat. (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), notes that Gauguin didn\u2019t start exploring the process of the monotype until the summer of 1894 upon his return to Brittany. While this work may have been used as a matrix to pull monotypes or counterproofs at a later date, the drawing itself was likely produced in Tahiti in 1892 at the time he was producing the aforementioned paintings. It is inconclusive whether he was producing these counterproofs and monotypes in Brittany or back in his studio in Paris, but he certainly was producing them between his two Tahitian trips upon his return to France.\n\nPeter Kort Zegers confirmed and replicated this process with a facsimile gouache matrix.

The section of the counterproof in the Art Institute\u2019s collection was repurposed by the artist to make the wood-block print Oviri (cat. 84.1 [Kornfeld 35]).\n\nPeter Zegers discovered this process and replicated it with a glass matrix.

Gauguin left Durrio several works on paper from his Parisian studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, prior to his departure for his second trip to Tahiti in 1895. Scholarship is inconclusive as to whether Gauguin gave the works to Durrio as a gift or consigned them to Durrio for sale. Gonz\u00e1lez de Durana, Alzuri, and Amezaga, who have researched the relationship between the two artists, reason that the works were likely a gift, because the penniless Durrio was unable to serve as a trustworthy salesman and the works were seen as being of little value because Gauguin left them behind when he returned to Tahiti.\n\nAnna Gruetzner Robins, \u201c\u2018Manet and the Post-Impressionists\u2019: A Checklist of Exhibits,\u201d Burlington Magazine, 152, no. 1293 (Dec. 2010), pp. 787\u201388.
