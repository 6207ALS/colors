    "description": "<p>The Roman general Mark Antony forged an alliance with Queen Cleopatra of Egypt in an attempt to capture Rome\u2019s eastern territories. On this coin he had himself depicted wearing the ivy-leaf crown of Dionysos in order to reinforce his claim that he was \u201cthe new Dionysos\u201d and therefore had divine right to rule. The Greek historian Plutarch (Antony, 24:3) described Antony\u2019s entry into Ephesus in 41 CE as follows:</p>\n<p>&quot;When he entered Ephesus, women dressed like Bacchants, men and boys like satyrs and Pans, led the way. The city was full of ivy and thyrsos-wands and harps, pipes and flutes. People were calling him Dionysos Giver of Joy and the Benefactor.&quot;</p>\n",
