    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Print developed from Paul Cezanne\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Madame Cezanne in a Red Armchair</em>, About 1877.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">C\u00e9zanne\u2019s wife, Hortense Fiquet, was his most frequent\u2014and perhaps most patient\u2014model, the subject of nearly thirty portraits. Here, the compressed space and blank facial expression make the sitter appear at once close and distant. Green touches of paint on her face cover more naturalistic shadows, contributing to the work\u2019s distinctively modern character, and resonate with C\u00e9zanne\u2019s own description of his work as a \u201charmony parallel to nature.\u201d</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image size:</strong>&nbsp; 14.25 x 11in.</li><li><strong>Full poster size:&nbsp;</strong>16 x 12 in.</li><li><strong>Material:&nbsp;</strong>Premium Cardstock</li></ul>",
