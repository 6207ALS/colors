    "inscriptions": "Unmarked recto or verso\n\n\nThe members of John Humphrey Noyes\u2019 highly religious and communistic Oneida Society believed that people could become perfect simply by accepting Christ into their souls. This was reasonable enough, but everything that followed that simple belief was radical to the point of heresy. God was both male and female, and thus the community was governed by men and women alike. In the spirit of the holy community of Christians, every member of the community should equally love everyone else, including sexually. Monogamous marriage was a tyranny, \u201cegotism for two,\u201d and was replaced by the enlarged family that came to be known as \u201ccomplex marriage.\u201d\n\nEventually a hierarchy developed in which the most spiritual members had the most access to sexual contact (Noyes presumably at the top of the ladder). Unwanted pregnancies were avoided by \u201cmale continence,\u201d whereby \u201cthe skillful boatman may choose whether he will remain in the still water\u2026or run his boat over the falls.\u201d To hold together the web of emotionality that was associated with complex marriage, members engaged in \u201cmutual criticism,\u201d in which the person being discussed remained silent while every aspect of his or her being was open to analysis.\n\nQuite remarkably, it worked. The community, which held all property in common, thrived at Oneida from 1848 until 1881. In 1867, a eugenics experiment called stirpiculture was introduced\u2014a committee decided who would procreate with whom. Polly Held, seen here in the garden of Oneida in 1996, is the great-granddaughter of a stirpiculture union between John Humphrey Noyes and a female member of the community.\n\nIn August of 1879, reacting to internal pressures from dissatisfied lower spiritual-status members, as well as members anxious to have \u201cspecial love\u201d and committee-free procreation, the society discontinued \u201ccomplex marriage\u201d and transferred the community property to a joint-stock company in which everyone held shares. Former members could continue to live in the mansion (their descendents still do) and work in various Oneida industries. Their highly successful animal trap company was transformed into Oneida Limited, the well-known maker of silverware.\n\nIn a sense, the community, while dissolving, wrote its own eulogy: \u201cThe truth is, as the world will one day see and acknowledge, that [we] have not been pleasure-seeking spiritualists, but social architects, with high religious and moral aims, whose experiments and discourses [we] have sincerely believed would prove of value to mankind.\u201d \n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
