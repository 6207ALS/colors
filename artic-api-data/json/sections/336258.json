The scene is light-filled and animated, with a customer examining the merchandise while two dogs hover nearby. The female fruit vendor, or \u201cfruiti\u00e8re,\u201d is seen through the open doorway of the shop.\n\nWhistler sent the transfer drawing for La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle to London for processing on 17 September 1894, along with a letter giving the title that the image has retained ever since (letter 119). He explained to his printers that the image had been drawn on the new transfer paper produced especially for him by Lemercier. The paper was an unmounted papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, similar to the sheets he used for Rue Furstenburg (cat. 97), La Belle Dame paresseuse (cat. 98), The Forge, Passage du Dragon (cat. 102), and The Duet (cat. 104), but, he hoped, more carefully prepared to minimize irregularities in the gum-coated surface. In the same letter, he optimistically informed the Ways that the drawing, unlike the recent images of the passage du Dragon (cat. 102 and cat. 103), was \u201csimplicity itself\u2014most direct\u2014and with no fumbling and retouching.\u201d When the first proofs arrived from the printers, Whistler must have been pleased with the success of the drawing and its transfer to stone, for he ordered thirty impressions from the Ways in early October and promptly sent several to a number of dealers and collectors (letter 125).\n\nIt is instructive to compare this image to The Laundress: \u201cLa Blanchisseuse de la place Dauphine\u201d (cat. 93), a shopfront scene executed in early August, just before Whistler began to experiment with the smooth French transfer papers. The earlier image, drawn in a narrow range of tones on papier viennois, appears pale and muted when placed beside La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle, which was drawn with a greater range of tone on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal. This is due to the artist\u2019s different handling of his crayons on each type of paper. Clearly, the smooth surface of the French paper was more conducive to both thin and heavy applications of crayon, as well as more responsive to variations of the artist\u2019s touch. Whistler\u2019s telling criticism of The Laundress in a letter written to the Ways around August 19 explains how restrictive he found the grained surface of the papier viennois. He felt that the proofs of the image were \u201cpale in the chiaroscuro\u2014I mean less rich than I would like,\u201d and he complained that he felt constrained to work lightly on the paper because \u201cthe more black one puts on, the more grain appears.\u201d In contrast, when he wrote to his printers with instructions for proving La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle, he encouraged them to \u201cmake it give all that it will\u201d (letter 119). His recent switch from the grained German or Austrian transfer papers to the smooth French variety had eliminated the obtrusive mechanical grain of the paper and liberated him to pursue a greater range of tone that included darker passages of black.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid Japanese vellum (335 \u00d7 211 mm), signed; Palmer, cream laid paper (323 \u00d7 206 mm), signed.
