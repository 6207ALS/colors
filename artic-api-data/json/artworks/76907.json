    "description": "<p>David Smith found inspiration for his early work in the Surrealist sculptures of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34643\">Alberto Giacometti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/40418\">Hans Arp</a>, as well as the paintings of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/31309\">Arshile Gorky</a> and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/32048\">Joan Mir\u00f3</a>. Among the first American artists to master the use of steel and other industrial materials, Smith worked as a welder at a Studebaker automobile plant, where he gained firsthand experience with metal. He made <em>Beach Scene</em> early in his career, at a time when he was interested in organic forms and an unplanned, autonomous approach to art making: \u201cI do not work with a conscious and specific conviction about a piece of sculpture,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt is always open to change and a new association.\u201d</p>\n",
