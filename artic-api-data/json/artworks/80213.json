    "description": "<p>This painting bears a spurious signature of the Yuan dynasty painter Sheng Mou , is likely a 17th-century wholesale recreation of a recorded original of the same title and date done by Sheng Mou for the 14th-century poet Lu Pu. As such, the painting evidences the attention that Sheng Mou's work attracted in the early 17th century, and references in the spurious inscriptions a network of recorded and transmitted paintings seemingly created in imitation of the same original. While the brushwork is related to known 17th-century painting styles, the subject matter and composition of this painting do homage to compositions associated with the work of Sheng Mou.</p>\n",

In the setting sun a solitary cloud fades away; Supreme laws of nature are present everywhere; In the urban marketplace as in the rural garden; You, sir, have grasped this wonder and responded; Though I have lost the memory of how to say it. Written by the man of the Nine-Dragon Mountain, Wang Fu\".\n3. colophon on the mounting to the left of the painting: clearly spurious, signed Gao Shiqi (1645-1703), dated 1688 \"There, through the tall and ancient pines, the waters course and flow; On rocks of paths scarce-travelled now, in patches mosses grow;  How much the Autumn'slight and shade delights the feeling eye; I recall Tiao Zha after rain, the mountains were just so!. Inscribed in the first decade of the tenth moon of the wucheng year of Kangxi (1688) by Jiangcun (stylename of Gao Shiqi)\".\n\nSeals:\n1. Seals of artist, following his inscription: 'Sheng Mou', 'Zizhao'.\n2. collector's seals: 3 spurious seals of Gao Shiqi; 5 spurious seals of the Qianlong imperial court.",
