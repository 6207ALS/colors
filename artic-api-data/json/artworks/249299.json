The boy in the center stands in front of his classmates, wearing a sash that signals his role helping other children safely cross the street. His outstretched arms reinforce his duty to lead and protect and his facial expression registers that he is poised and not afraid of what lies ahead. As the artist has noted, the letters <em>OK</em> printed diagonally on his shirt and the yellow eye on his left side simultaneously ward off evil forces and forecast that the children are prepared for the future and will be alright.</p>\n",
