    "content": "<section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section body\" id=\"body\">Although Ensor usually employed complete folios in the top two and bottom three rows, here he cut the sketchbook sheet in half (the cut is visible along the right edge). The drawing lines in blue chalk along the left edge of this sheet carry over directly to folio 1E/F. This provides additional evidence that the sheets were mounted together before the chalk was applied. In the upper right corner, some of Ensor\u2019s gestural strokes in blue chalk form wavy and circular lines, a sign that he worked quickly, or that the medium emphasized irregularities in the canvas mount.
