The top edge shows clearly that the blue chalk was applied after the sheets were mounted, as medium is absent in the area overlapped by the left half of folio 1A/B. In the lower region, Ensor drew tiny birds in black colored pencil over a greenish-blue background, also made in colored pencil. To create a visual transition, albeit a very superficial one, he extended the dinosaur\u2019s topknot from the composition below, in sheet 3A. SMC/KJN\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Sheet 2A. Interactive image.\n\nfig. 2 </section>",
