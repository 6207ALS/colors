They renewed their acquaintance in 1882 while Sickert was a student at the Slade School. Whistler persuaded the young artist to leave the Slade and become his pupil, assisting with studio chores and with the lengthy printing of the Venice etchings. Throughout the 1880s Sickert\u2019s paintings and etchings were strongly influenced by Whistler\u2019s style. In 1885 and 1886, the older artist painted three portraits of Sickert (YMSM 349\u201351) and two of his first wife, novelist Ellen Cobden (YMSM 337, 338). Sickert is also depicted in The Garden (cat. 40), a transfer lithograph of 1891. The friendship between the two artists became strained in the mid-1890s, when Whistler was angered by Sickert\u2019s apparent allegiance to Sir William Eden, with whom Whistler was engaged in a legal battle. The final break in their relationship came in April 1897, when Whistler appeared in court to support Joseph Pennell\u2019s libel suit against Sickert.\n\nThis portrait of Walter Sickert must have been drawn in early February 1895. It is probably the \u201cnew Drawing\u201d that was transferred by the Ways on February 8 (app. II.4). After the drawing was transferred, Whistler made a number of delicate changes in the image both by scraping and by adding tonal areas with crayon directly on the stone. No proofs of the portrait prior to these alterations have survived. Careful study of the completed image reveals that the following changes were made: crayon additions to the sitter\u2019s left shoulder and to the area of hatched shadow in the background to the left of his head; delicate scraping of the sitter\u2019s left shoulder, ear, and hair; scraping in the shadows along the right side of the face and below the indication of the raised foot on the left. Also visible are two faint horizontal lines, one running across the calves of Sickert\u2019s legs and the other across his chin and collar, spaced 85 mm apart\u2014the distinctive flaws of a batch of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal that Whistler had been using in Paris during the autumn of 1894 (see also cat. 107, cat. 108, cat. 109, cat. 110, cat. 111, and cat. 112).\n\nIn this portrait the sitter\u2019s face and torso are thrown into brilliant relief against the surrounding shadows, a compositional strategy that the artist later exploited more fully in the \u201cfirelight portraits\u201d of 1896 (cat. 143, cat. 144, and cat. 145). It is one of the last documents of a friendship that had already begun to break down; Whistler listed the portrait of Walter Sickert among a group of images he wished to exclude from the Fine Art Society\u2019s December 1895\u201396 exhibition of his lithographs. He further suppressed the image by having the Ways print very few proofs of it, and he did not bother to retain one for himself.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (285 \u00d7 224 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid Japanese vellum (293 \u00d7 234 mm), signed.

See Whistler\u2019s account of the affair, Eden versus Whistler. The Baronet and the Butterfly: A Valentine with a Verdict (Paris, 1899); see also Getscher and Marks (1986), pp. 204\u201305; and Ronald Anderson and Anne Koval, James McNeill Whistler: Beyond the Myth (London, 1994), pp. 373\u201374, 382, 385\u201389, 419\u201321.\n\nSickert published an attack on transfer lithography, and on Joseph Pennell\u2019s transfer lithographs in particular, in The Saturday Review (26 December 1896, pp. 667\u201368). Pennell sued both Sickert and the editor of the paper, Frank Harris; see Nicholas Smale, \u201cWhistler\u2019s Lithographic Techniques,\u201d para. 38. On the unraveling of the Whistler-Sickert relationship, see Andrew Dempsey, \u201cWhistler and Sickert: A Friendship and Its End,\u201d Apollo 83, no. 47 (January 1966), pp. 30\u201337.\n\nAt the time Whistler was sharing Sickert\u2019s studio at 13 Robert Street in North London. He and his ailing wife had come to London in December 1894 for medical consultations. They remained in London, staying at Long\u2019s Hotel in New Bond Street, until March 1895, when Whistler returned to Paris for the Eden trial. Anderson and Koval (note 1) suggested that this portrait was drawn at the Pennells\u2019 apartment on Buckingham Street (p. 385). Both Sickert and Whistler frequented the Pennells\u2019 regular Thursday evening gatherings; see Elizabeth Pennell, Nights (Philadelphia and London, 1916), pp. 201, 216\u201321.\n\nSee letter from Marcus Huish to Whistler, 12 November 1895, GUL F240.\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 44.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 115, only state.
