Gauguin included a title in only two of the images, Te atua (The Gods) (cat. 103) and Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will Be Happy) (cat. 100). The rest bear titles assigned after Gauguin died by authorities such as Marcel Gu\u00e9rin (who produced the first catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the artist\u2019s prints). He and others derived these titles by relating the images to works by Gauguin in other media depicting similar subject matter and carrying titles attributed to Gauguin such as At the Black Rocks (cat. 91).\n\nThis is one of four in the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints that depict Tahitian subjects. The other three are Te arii vahine\u2014opoi (Woman with Mangos\u2014Tired) (cat. 96), Tahitian Carrying Bananas (cat. 98), and Plate with the Head of a Horned Devil (cat. 99) (see fig. 97.1). These thematically related works can stand on their own, but when placed end to end, they can also be read as a frieze-like arrangement. Gauguin left no instructions as to how to display the prints that make up the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints. However, the inventory drawn up after his death, on May 8, 1903, of the contents of his \u201cHouse of Pleasure\u201d in Atuona, on the Marquesan island of Hiva Oa, lists \u201c45 wood-block prints [gravures] pasted down the length of the partition walls.\u201d Gauguin seems to have used three sets of this suite of prints to embellish his living quarters, employing a time-honored principle of interior decoration: the repetition of motifs, as exemplified by the frequent use of repeats in illustrated wallpaper borders.\n\nThis composition is rendered enigmatic by the isolation of its vignettes, one from the other. Resembling components of a collage, they are not united by a design element such as the ocher applied in the first stage of Soyez amoureuses, vous serez heureuses (Love, and You Will be Happy) (cat. 105) or Change of Residence (cat. 104). The wood matrix from which this image was made is in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague (fig. 97.2). Gauguin pasted the first state of the print, which is smaller in size and features fewer motifs than in the second (and final) state, onto the inside back cover of his 1902 manuscript L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme (Catholicism and the Modern Mind). It bears an inscription, in pen and ink, \u201c\u2014Paradis perdu\u2014\u201d (Paradise lost) (fig. 97.3).\n\nThe second-state impression (cats. 97.1 and 97.2) presents a composition that Gauguin expanded to the left. Beginning at the left and moving right, it includes a partly shrouded, standing woman, adjacent to whom are two rodents and a bird, suspended in midair. To their right and slightly above is another rodent. Below is a shrub or small tree that Gauguin transformed into a cartouche by including there his monogram and leaving space in which to inscribe, in pen and ink, a number: the Art Institute\u2019s examples bear the numbers 29 (cat. 97.1) and 2 (cat. 97.2). A man and woman sit at the bottom center of the composition, while at the far right is a standing nude female.\n\nSurrounding these motifs is a border comprising ground (at the bottom), tree trunks (at the sides), and branches (at the top). From the latter, leaves and blossoms extend into the space above the print\u2019s other motifs. The tree trunks seem generic, formal devices that do not appear to relate botanically to the species of flora that the artist featured growing from the branches. Gauguin\u2019s rendering of the leaves is specific enough to identify them as likely belonging to one of two coastal trees of the hibiscus family, the beach hibiscus and the portia tree. Gauguin\u2019s rendering of these details is not precise enough to settle on one or the other. While the artist depicted the flowers mainly in their closed state, as they are in the early morning when they begin to unfurl, they resemble hibiscus blooms as well (see fig. 97.4 and fig. 97.5).\n\nThe visual program of this print is yet another example of Gauguin\u2019s tireless extraction of images from the Buddhist friezes of the temple of Borobudur in Central Java, of which he had two photographs for his own artistic purposes (fig. 97.6 and fig. 97.7). Derived from a mongoose in one of the friezes is the animal enmeshed with a large leaf (see fig. 97.8). So too are all the other vignettes: the standing woman at the left (see fig. 97.9); the conflated forms of two rodents (which seem to be mating, although this does not seem to be the case with their hard-to-decipher prototype in Borobudur) and the bird (see fig. 97.10); the stylized small tree or shrub with Gauguin\u2019s monogram (see fig. 97.11); the couple seated at the bottom center (see fig. 97.12); and the standing female nude, based on a representation of the Buddha (see fig. 97.13). The position of this woman\u2019s hands derives from one of Buddha\u2019s traditional gestures (mudras). It is also possible, given her placement in Gauguin\u2019s print, that the nude may be reaching for one of the blossoms above her. She is further informed by the female featured in the 1892 oil painting Te nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (fig. 97.14 [W 455]), in a graphite nude study (fig. 97.15), and in the similarly titled plate 6 of the 1893\u201394 Noa Noa Suite (cat. 56) and other related works.\n\nThe prototype for the seated couple in the present print is found in Gauguin\u2019s 1896 oil painting Eiaha ohipa (Do Not Work) (fig. 97.16 [W 538]). A few years after he had completed the Suite of Late Wood-Block Prints, the artist returned to his photograph of the similar pair at Borobudur when he executed his 1901 painting Et l\u2019or de leur corps (And the Gold of Their Bodies) (fig. 97.17 [W 596]). A summary rendition of the couple appears in the background of Seated Female, a transfer monotype from 1902 (fig. 97.18 [Field 1973 43]), which Harriet K. Stratis discovered relates one-to-one in scale to the seated couple in the foreground of the present wood-block print, as well as to a watercolor monotype, Seated Male (fig. 97.19 [Field 1973 138]).  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Marcel Gu\u00e9rin, L\u2019oeuvre grav\u00e9 de Gauguin (H.
