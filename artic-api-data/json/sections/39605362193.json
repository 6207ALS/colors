While numerous publications cite Roy as the sole printer of the edition, it is the authors\u2019 opinion that the production of the Roy impressions\u2014as sheets from the edition are known\u2014was a collaboration and not a commission and that the two men exchanged ideas about the media, methods for inking blocks, paper type, and the use of stencils. Perhaps Roy had access to a small press where he could print the blocks in more significant numbers than could quickly and easily be produced by hand. However, Roy could not have independently determined how to manipulate the ink to achieve Gauguin\u2019s desired effects, nor could he have known the degree to which the artist wished for the various ink layers to differ both in their surface texture and in their registration. No two Roy impressions are exactly alike. The inks were manipulated in several ways: in some impressions close visual examination reveals that their composition was altered with additives that made the inks bulkier and more dimensional; in others, the consistency of the ink rolled onto the block was made more or less viscous, and in many, the loaded ink roller was passed over the block more than once. In some of the prints, the ink was applied with a dry brush, perhaps a stencil brush, as well as a roller. In all of the prints, one or more stencils were used to position and isolate various zones of color on a tone block or on the paper itself. Ultimately, the two collaborators did not succeed in producing a standard, visually uniform edition. Instead, they printed a group that is visually engaging in its own right, and quite distinct from Gauguin\u2019s solo experiments with printing his wood blocks.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 59.3.2).\n\nTo create this impression, a tone block was printed in chrome yellow ink, over which a stencil was used to brush apply a deep vermilion red tone directly to the paper with a stencil brush, followed by the uneven printing of the image in carbon black ink (see fig. 59.3.3). The yellow and black inks were each applied with a roller onto their respective blocks. The paper tone was retained only along the right side of the yellow forms and the seated figure, where the stenciled yellow was deliberately skewed 4 mm to the left (fig. 59.3.4). Two separate stencils were used. The first stencil, used in conjunction with the tone block, demarcated chrome yellow passages that extend across the sheet from upper left to lower right (fig. 59.3.5). In raking light the outline of the stencil is clearly visible where there is a change in the surface gloss of the media that underlie the black printing ink. The second stencil was used to position passages of deep-red ink applied with a stencil brush (fig. 59.3.6). The consistency of the deep-red ink (a mixture of vermilion and an iron oxide [likely hematite]), is more fluid than the roller-applied printing inks. Its irregular surface texture, with peaks and valleys visible under magnification, is the result of the amount of solvent added to the ink to obtain the consistency required to achieve this effect. This is the same ink used in the production of the Art Institute\u2019s other Roy impression of Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59.4), only it is applied more thickly in more than one layer, which obscures much of the underlying paper.\n\nThe stencils were used repeatedly throughout production of the edition. This is confirmed by examination of a large number of prints, which determined that the shapes of the forms, their dimensions, and their distance from each other is nearly identical in all of them. The only variable is the position of the stencil. With substantial borders of paper around the printed image, the positioning of the image 2 mm up and 3 mm to the right of the underlying yellow tone and red stenciling is readily apparent. Registration was jettisoned in favor of a deliberate, and random, skewing of the printings, as Gauguin had done in so many of the impressions that he had previously printed on his own.\n\nThe black ink was applied unevenly in two layers, and rolled out onto the block diagonally following the diagonal trajectory of the composition. On the right, the ink was applied in a thin layer so that the paper fibers are visible (fig. 59.3.7), especially where there were fine creases in the paper. On the left, the ink was applied more thickly so that much of the texture imparted by the paper fibers is no longer visible.\n\nThe Roy edition is said to number twenty-five to thirty impressions printed from a block that was constructed from more than eighteen sections of end-grain boxwood.\n\nGauguin and Roy selected a paper for their collaborative printing of the Noa Noa Suitet hat was a sturdy, medium-weight paper commonly used for printing at the time. The paper is of Western manufacture, although its weight and smooth surface are reminiscent of the fine-quality Japanese vellum papers that were so coveted by artists and printers at the time. While the Japanese precursors upon which the imitation vellums were modeled were made with the finest Japanese paper fibers, their Western counterparts were manufactured with a large proportion of acidic wood-pulp fibers and a great deal of sizing, making them more affordable for mass distribution. The inclusion of wood pulp, however, made it impossible for Western papermakers to reproduce the lustrous surface quality of the Japanese papers. The addition of wood pulp also made the imitation vellums more susceptible to color change with exposure to light. While the inclusion of large quantities of sizing in the paper helped to produce the hard, smooth, sturdy surfaces characteristic of imitation vellums, which were robust enough for printing wood blocks, the papers absorbed the printing inks less readily. As a result, the inks sit high on the surface of the paper. This gives the Roy impressions a flat, bold, graphic appearance overall, one that is unmistakable in print production of the nineteenth century.\n\n207 \u00d7 358 mm (image); 246 \u00d7 395 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print is in good condition. There is ink offset on the verso, probably from contact with another impression in a drying stack. Pinholes appear in the corners.  \nHarriet K.

The pigments were identified by XRF and macro-XRF.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">This was printed by Louis Roy in spring/summer 1894 as part of an edition of about twenty-five to thirty impressions.\n\nIt is not known what distribution of a set of Roy impressions might have comprised. It is clear from examination of numerous impressions that the collaborators were unable to produce a standardized edition for sale since there is great variation among them. A set within a portfolio similar to that produced for Pola Gauguin\u2019s posthumous printing has never been identified. It is known that Roy was among the group of artists involved in the production of the Catalogue de l\u2019Exposition de peintures du groupe impressionniste et synth\u00e9tiste in 1889 and the exhibition to which it relates (see cat. 22).\n\nThis comment is based on study of the prints. In some impressions the inks that were used emulate the dimensionality of the oil-based media that Gauguin used in his impressions, and the manner in which the stencils and blocks were skewed for printing also emulates the artist\u2019s practice. It is possible that Roy recommended the paper type they used since it is one that had not appeared in Gauguin\u2019s graphic production until this moment.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Roy impressions from the Noa Noa Suite.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThe pigments in the printing inks were identified by XRF and macro-XRF in this impression as well as in Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57.2), and in another impression of Auti te pape (cat. 59.4).

See also correspondence from Eberhard Kornfeld to Harold Joachim, Dec. 16, 1978: \u201cAccording to Carl Zigrosser, Fanny L\u00e5stblom was a Danish artist who lived in Paris at 10, rue Vercing\u00e9torix, near Gauguin\u2019s studio. She owned probably all ten of the Louis Roy impressions that were given to her by the artist in 1895. Mr. Zigrosser purchased them for the Weyhe Gallery when Miss L\u00e5stblom was in New York.\u201d Curatorial object file, Department of Prints and Drawings, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFanny L\u00e5stblom had nine Gauguin Noa Noa wood-block prints sent to the Art Institute via Gerda Ahlm for purchase consideration on November 4, 1924. The Art Institute did not purchase the print at this time. It is likely they were solicited to Albert Roullier Galleries, Chicago. The Roullier family gave the print to the Art Institute two years later in 1926.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 59.3 Auti te pape (Women at the River), from the Noa Noa Suite, 1894.\n\nfig. 59.3.1 Verso of Gauguin\u2019s Auti te pape (Women at the River), from the Noa Noa Suite (1894).
