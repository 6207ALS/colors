These coincide with his improved circumstances\u2014from itinerancy to a settled home and a secure funding source, the result of significant purchases of his work by his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel. Although the Monets\u2019 comfortable existence would turn precarious again in 1874 as a result of Durand-Ruel\u2019s own faltering finances, the dealer\u2019s patronage made possible the rental of a spacious house and garden where Monet and his family lived from the end of 1871 until the summer of 1874. In contrast to the many canvases painted during this period, which were dominated by river views and riverside promenades, the newly built railway bridge, pleasure boats, fields, and factories, The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil is one of a handful of canvases that depict his wife, whom he had married in 1870, and their child enjoying their newly established domesticity.\n\nForemost among the reasons for Monet\u2019s decision to move his family from Paris to the \u201cagr\u00e9able petite ville\u201d\u2014as Argenteuil was described in local guidebooks\u2014was its location, which was equally picturesque (situated along a wide expanse of the Seine) and convenient (a mere fifteen-minute train ride to the Gare Saint-Lazare, Paris). Having returned to France from Holland after his self-imposed exile during the Franco-Prussian War and Commune insurrection at the end of 1871, Monet and his family registered at the H\u00f4tel de Londres et New York on the place du Havre, opposite the Gare Saint-Lazare and a few blocks from Monet\u2019s rue de l\u2019Isly studio. The house he found in Argenteuil was similarly well situated\u2014down the street from the Argenteuil station, which facilitated the possibility of commuting to Paris to use his studio and returning home to Argenteuil in the evening.\n\nThe house had been most recently rented by the Realist painter Th\u00e9ophile Ribot, and it was probably recommended to Monet by \u00c9douard Manet, who knew the owner, Mme Emilie-Jeanne Aubry, and whose family owned a property in nearby Gennevilliers. Situated at the corner of the rue Pierre Guienne and the boulevard Saint-Denis, the handsome, three-story house had a cellar (cave) and garden covering a total of 28,654 square feet. In many ways the Maison Aubry, which eventually included a staff of a gardener and two domestic servants, was Monet\u2019s coming-of-age residence.\n\nDespite the no doubt bustling household Monet established in Argenteuil, he rarely depicted interior domestic scenes. In Camille at the Window, Argenteuil at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (fig. 15.1 [W287]) we catch a glimpse of the interior of Monet\u2019s rue Pierre Guienne home. This first home in Argenteuil was distinguished by its red shuttered fa\u00e7ade that opened out onto a stone dust courtyard, with decorative pots and meticulously organized flower beds that line the \u201cstage\u201d on which the child plays with a wooden hoop in the Chicago painting. In the Virginia picture, a female figure looks out of a window from the interior, which is more implied than clearly described, onto the courtyard. The woman here, possibly a housemaid, expresses a sense of inquietude and ambivalence that is at odds with the familial harmony exuded by the composition of the Art Institute painting, in which young Jean is watched over by his mother, who stands in the open doorway.\n\nIn The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil the focal point of the composition is Jean, turned away and wearing summery garb with a wide, gray-black sash tied at the back, who stands at center. The blue-and-white-glazed flower pots are on either side of his figure. At some point Monet eliminated a pot, which was positioned next to the now single vessel to the left of Jean (fig. 15.2); this adjustment more directly aligns the boy as the main focal point within a diagonal of the decorative ceramics at lower right and the single pot at upper left (see Technical Report). In comparison to the lush vegetation of the circular flower bed, the beds around the house, and a variety of flowering plants in the large vases (which the artist could have brought back from his trip to Holland in 1871), Jean and Camille seem vaguely, almost perfunctorily, rendered. X-ray and UV examinations reveal that the artist made several important changes to the figures, especially to the child. As Mary Mathews Gedo points out, this painting had to have been executed prior to Jean\u2019s sixth birthday on August 8, 1873, since he has not yet graduated from unisex dress to short pants. Four quick strokes of black make up the wide bow (fig. 15.3) painted over an earlier bow or sash of a greenish blue that is similar if not an exact match of that used for the signature (fig. 15.4).\n\nThe Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil can be compared to the contemporary depictions of Jean in a garden setting, such as Camille and Jean Monet in the Garden at Argenteuil (fig. 15.5 [W280]) and Le d\u00e9jeuner: Panneau d\u00e9coratif (fig. 15.6 [W285]). The Chicago view is unique in showing Jean alone, standing, and facing away from the viewer. In Le d\u00e9jeuner, Jean is seated in profile, absorbed in play with wooden building blocks, while in Camille and Jean Monet in the Garden at Argenteuil he looks out toward his mother, his hand touching the wooden hoop that is steadied by the aproned house servant or nanny to his left. Infrared examination of the Art Institute\u2019s painting shows that Jean was initially conceived as seated there, too, perhaps in a cart or on the pavement facing out, among objects that appear to be toys rather than a hoop (fig. 15.7). The infrared image also reveals that an earlier stage of the composition included the child wearing a brimmed hat. Additional forms visible in the infrared image in the area in front of the child suggests a wheeled object, similar to the small wheelbarrow or push-cart toy in the foreground of another child-in-garden composition, painted seven years later (fig. 15.8 [W685]). In this familial scene, Monet\u2019s second son (Michel, b. 1878) stands on a garden path, flanked by similarly styled decorative pots.\n\nThe changes made to Jean's position in an earlier stage of composition suggest that Monet had an analogous seated pose in mind that he abandoned. The changes are evident on the final surface, through which one can detect bits of flesh-tone pigments in the area where the boy\u2019s face would have been positioned, as well as evidence of the pale blue used for the torso, a similar shade, moreover, to that used for the figure of the seated child in the other two paintings (see fig. 15.5 and fig. 15.6). Although there are no extant drawings or sketches from which to interpret Monet\u2019s reasons for changing the seated Jean to the standing child who turns away from the viewer (fig. 15.9), it is tempting to think that the artist had in mind Manet\u2019s The Railway (fig. 15.10), begun in 1872, in which a neighbor\u2019s daughter poses facing away from the viewer and wears a similar white dress bowed at the back.\n\nAn ever-present figure in the house and garden views, the female figure in the doorway with deeply set eyes and dark hair fits the shorthand Monet often used for his wife. Camille\u2019s dress, which appears to be painted so lightly as to have been breathed onto the canvas, is actually the result of a relatively dense application of pink and blue pigments over a cream-colored dress visible underneath (see Technical Report). The X-ray suggests that the woman originally wore a fuller, shapeless robe d\u2019int\u00e9rieur that had broader sleeves (fig. 15.11). Her face, now covered in pinkish flesh tones, was earlier laid in using grayish beige and included brownish daubs that may have articulated her eyes (fig. 15.12). Whereas Monet\u2019s first idea signaled Camille, in the final composition, her features are more generalized than those with which he customarily identified her.\n\nIn contrast to other works in which the artist\u2019s vantage point is closer to his subject (e.g., fig. 15.5), for the Chicago composition Monet repositioned himself farther back on the same stone-dust courtyard and just to the left of the house, looking toward the flowering trees that dominate other canvases depicting the garden (e.g., fig. 15.13 [W282]). Although scholars have interpreted Jean\u2019s isolation and the smaller, retiring female in the doorway as symbolizing strain within the Monet family, there is no evidence to indicate that Monet intended his placement of Jean to suggest estrangement. And the presence of the boy\u2019s mother seems in keeping with Jean\u2019s age and other paintings coupling a female attendant with Jean, at the crossroads of childhood, from toddler to young boy.\n\nThe seven years Monet spent at Argenteuil were significant and prolific. For the first time in his career, he enjoyed accommodations that allowed him to entertain journalists, writers, collectors, and especially artist-friends Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Gustave Caillebotte, Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, and Manet. These visits, documented by paintings and portraits, resulted also in further discussions of the artistic agenda of this like-minded group. And it is no coincidence that the homogeneity of the works painted in Argenteuil by Renoir, Caillebotte, and Manet, among others, laid the groundwork for a common cause and, ultimately, for a proposal, composed and signed in Monet\u2019s living room on the rue Pierre Guienne, that called for a series of exhibitions that would begin in 1874.\n\nEven though the Maison Aubry was used as a meeting place, for Monet, it was first and foremost a home with a well-cared-for garden; a kind of suburban showcase that provided a generous backdrop for new motifs and new directions. In The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil, we have a rare glimpse of how the Monets lived in Argenteuil in this depiction of Monet\u2019s son playing outside the family home. It is a picture that Monet no doubt knew would appeal to his Parisian public the ideal suburban scene, lush, light-filled, and family oriented. That he changed the pose of his son\u2014from seated to a standing position, and from facing out to turning away\u2014suggests that he considered even family members as pictorial elements. In the final composition, Jean\u2019s pose, echoing the verticality of the decorative pots, offers a splash of lightness to the courtyard in shadow. Camille\u2019s pink and blue dress animates the columns of green ivy that frame her. Monet is off stage, observing, a position mirroring the reality of his situation while at Argenteuil\u2014as husband and father, businessman and artist-in-residence, and, as this painting makes clear, already an appreciative and avid horticulturalist.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil was painted on a pre-primed, no. 20 portrait (figure) linen canvas. A stamp for the color merchant Latouche was present on the back of the original stretcher (discarded). The warm-gray-colored ground consists of two layers. The ground remains visible throughout the composition at breaks in the brushwork. The composition was built up from an initial lay-in of relatively thin layers of opaque paint. The artist made use of a variety of brushwork in the painting, including localized areas of more thickly applied, textural wet-in-wet application in the flowers and foliage and thinly applied strokes of opaque color applied with flat brushes used to denote, for example, the dappled sunlight on the pavement. Technical examination revealed pentimenti in the area to the right of the child. It appears that, at an earlier stage of the painting, the child was depicted facing the viewer, possibly in a seated or crouching position. Farther in the foreground of the earlier painting, there are circular forms related to an unidentified object or objects. These earlier elements were covered over with thinly applied paint that is similar to, but does not exactly match, the surrounding foreground paint, and probably due to the increased transparency of the overlying paint layers over time, the painted-out forms remain faintly visible to the unaided eye. The artist also made alterations to some of the flowerpots, including the elimination of one on the left side of the composition, and to the female figure\u2019s form. Other more minor changes, made during the final stages of painting, are evident, such as the addition of the diagonal band of green foliage at the lower right.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 15.14).\n\nSigned: Claude Monet (lower right, in bluish-green paint) (fig. 15.15). The underlying paint was dry when the signature was applied.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond to a no. 20 portrait (figure) standard-size stretcher (73 \u00d7 60 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.9V (0.8) \u00d7 20.5H (0.9) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild, fairly even cusping on the top, right, and bottom edges, with stronger cusping along the left edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1968 treatment (see Conservation History). The canvas is attached with copper tacks irregularly spaced 1.5\u201310 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced 4\u20137 cm apart; most correspond to the cusping pattern.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.8 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1968-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. The 1968 treatment notes indicate that the previous stretcher was five membered with a vertical crossbar. Depth: Not documented. There is more fabric on the left and top tacking edges, and a continuous fold in the canvas on those edges suggests that excess fabric was folded over the back edge of the original stretcher. If this was the case, the original stretcher depth would have been approximately 1.8 cm.\n\nA partially illegible, oval-shaped stamp from the color merchant Latouche was transcribed from the back of the pre-1968-treatment stretcher (discarded) (see Conservation History): TOILES TABLEAUX &amp; COULEURS / LATOUCHE / 5 xxxxxx / xxxxxx (fig. 15.16)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of the top, bottom, and right tacking margins but stops short of the left edge (fig. 15.17). This suggests that the canvas was cut down from a larger piece of primed fabric on the top, bottom, and right sides; the left edge probably corresponds to the edge of the larger roll of canvas, which was attached to the commercial priming frame. Based on cross-sectional analysis, the ground appears to consist of two layers; this is consistent in samples from both the tacking edge and the picture plane (fig. 15.18). In the backscattered electron (BSE) images, the lower layer appears richer in lead white, as evidenced by its brighter white appearance, and has a finer particle size distribution (fig. 15.19). The lower layer ranges from approximately 10 to 50 \u00b5m in thickness. The top layer measures approximately 75 to 145 \u00b5m in thickness. Relatively large white clumps are visible in the ground layer when the surface of the painting is observed microscopically (fig. 15.20).\n\nOnly the upper ground layer is visible when the painting surface is examined microscopically. It has a warm-gray tone with scattered black, red, and yellow pigment particles. Cross-sectional analysis shows that there is another layer underneath. The lower layer appears to have a similar tone as the top layer and it is difficult to distinguish optically (fig. 15.21).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the two layers have similar compositions, consisting mainly of lead white with minor amounts of bone black and iron oxides (with associated silicates), silica, silicates, and alumina. The large white clusters seem to be concentrated in the upper ground layer\u2014some have penetrated the surface\u2014and are composed of lead (possibly lead soaps) (fig. 15.22, fig. 15.23).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe main elements of the composition were laid in with thinly applied layers of opaque paint. The pale-gray ground remains visible in areas throughout the painting, through thin paint layers and gaps in the brushwork; for example, at the junctures of the main compositional elements, within areas of foliage, and in thinly painted passages of the sky (fig. 15.24). It seems that the larger masses of foliage were broadly mapped out with thin, transparent layers of dull-green and dark-brown paint (fig. 15.25). The artist then built up the foliage and flower beds using thicker touches and strokes of more intensely colored paint; these are often applied wet-in-wet or with two or more unmixed colors picked up on the paintbrush, and exhibit low or collapsed impasto (fig. 15.26, fig. 15.27). Localized areas of wet-in-wet mixing are also visible in the female figure\u2019s dress, where the pink and blue paints were added over top of the still-wet cream-colored paint (fig. 15.28). Thick, opaque, horizontal strokes are used to represent sunlight falling on the left and distant areas of the pavement (fig. 15.29).\n\nTechnical examination has revealed that the artist made changes to the composition in the area immediately to the right of the child (fig. 15.30). It appears that the child was originally positioned facing the viewer, either crouching or sitting. The artist covered this area with relatively thin layers of paint and the underlying figure remains partially visible to the unaided eye (fig. 15.31). The figure was developed to some degree, as evidenced by rough facial features that can just be made out in the infrared reflectogram (fig. 15.32) and the flesh tone of the face, which is only partially obscured by the thick yellow horizontal paint stroke applied on top. The curving red stroke visible just above the later yellow stroke may delineate the brim of the child\u2019s hat, which may have been similar to that seen on the child in the final painting (fig. 15.33). The torso of the earlier child, which appears to consist of pale-blue paint (fig. 15.34), also remains partially visible. Some of the dark, linear elements in this area could be indications of arms or drapery folds from clothing. To the lower right of the painted-out figure, an area of thick, off-white-colored paint is visible beneath the pinkish-gray paint of the pavement (fig. 15.35), but it is unclear what this paint relates to. Further to the foreground, in the area between the final child\u2019s feet and the signature, there appears to be another object or objects, which includes two or three dark, roughly circular forms. It is unclear whether these forms were included with the earlier figure, or whether they were painted at the same time as the final child, and then covered over. The infrared reflectogram (fig. 15.30) shows a long diagonal form that extends from the painted-out object up to the right hand of the final child, however, perhaps arguing for the latter scenario.\n\nThe artist modified other areas of the composition as well. The initial painting of the female figure\u2019s face, for example, is more grayish-beige in tone and includes details in brownish paint, possibly denoting her eyes. Over this, the thick, opaque strokes of the peachy flesh tone, which pass slightly over the dried paint of the hat and the yellow collar of her garment, obscure the lower two-thirds of the first painting of the face (fig. 15.36). The appearance of the woman\u2019s body in the X-ray and infrared images suggests that the figure was originally broader or perhaps incorporated a long, flowing sleeve on the left side (fig. 15.37). At the back of the paved area just left of the child\u2019s head, the artist appears to have originally included a pair of chairs, more clearly seen in the infrared image (fig. 15.30); they were executed in pale-yellow paint that was largely obscured by the dark-green foliage and orange and yellow flowers applied over top (fig. 15.38). It is uncertain what these structures are, as they have been largely obscured by the dark-green foliage and orange and yellow flowers applied over top. In the lower right quadrant of the painting, some adjustments were made to the flowerpots. The first three pots (from front) look like they have been extended at their bases, the paint of which was applied on top of the pavement. In each case, the lowermost stroke consists of greenish-blue paint not used elsewhere in the pots (fig. 15.39). The fourth pot from front, on the other hand, looks like it may have been decreased in size slightly (fig. 15.40), and the farthest pot was painted largely over the foliage behind, perhaps suggesting that it was not part of the original compositional plan. The lowest tier of green foliage in front of the house (near the lower right corner) appears to have been a late addition to the painting, covering pavement that originally extended to the border of blue flowers (fig. 15.41). At the border of the garden on the left side of the painting, it appears that a second pot was originally included in the painting, just left of the existing pot (fig. 15.42). The pot was subsequently covered by the green paint of the border of the flower bed, but strokes of blue and white paint remain visible on the surface. The presence of localized dark-gray or black paint near the child\u2019s feet (especially to the left of the left foot) may indicate that minor adjustments were made to their position (fig. 15.43).\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes); smaller, possibly pointed brushes for finer details. A few brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, bone black, chrome yellow (two different hues), Naples yellow, cadmium yellow, iron oxide yellow, vermilion, red lake, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, cerulean blue, emerald green, and viridian. UV fluorescence of some of the red and pink strokes indicates that the artist used red lake in some of the flowers.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish was applied in 1968 (see Conservation History). It has a variable sheen, depending on the qualities of the underlying paint, and creates areas of specular reflection in certain light. There are residues of yellowed natural-resin varnish in the recesses of the brushwork. It is not known when the natural-resin varnish was applied.\n\nThe 1968 pretreatment examination report states that an earlier surface coating had been removed and the painting revarnished at some point.\n\nIn 1968, discolored surface films, including a \u201csoft resin\u201d varnish, and overpaint were removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied and minor inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nThe work is in good condition overall. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. There is a slight indentation or ridge in the canvas, just above the bottom edge, which may be related to the original foldover. The weave impression is quite strong, possibly the result of the lining process. The original tacking margins are deteriorated and may have been trimmed in places. There are losses and abrasion in the fabric at all corners, and splits in the canvas at the upper right, upper left, and lower left foldovers; all areas are stable. Localized areas of tiny paint losses, cracking, and abrasion are present around all of the original foldovers. The paint layer is in very good condition, with only a few tiny losses near the edges. A few brush hairs are embedded in the paint surface. There is a general network of fine age cracks, mostly visible only microscopically. Stretcher-bar cracks from the original vertical crossbar and an intersecting diagonal crack are prominent in the sky. Localized areas of drying cracks are present in the foliage and flower beds. There is minor retouching around the edges of the painting. Residues of discolored natural-resin varnish are visible microscopically in the recesses of the paint texture. Starch-paste residues and wax-resin residues from the lining procedure are also visible microscopically over the surface. The work has a synthetic surface coating, which has a variable sheen depending on the qualities of the underlying paint. There are a few tiny accretions on the surface.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame: The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), nineteenth-century, Louis XVI Salon style, reverse-ogee frame with acanthus-leaf, laurel-and-berry, and beaded composition ornament and a stepped frieze. The frame has both water and oil gilding over French yellow bole; red-orange bole was applied over the composition ornament and the frieze. The frame retains its original glue size. The pine molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is torus outer molding with composition rope ornament; scotia side; fillet; torus, with composition laurel-and-berry ornament with fillet borders and strapped miters; reverse ogee with composition acanthus-leaf ornament; hollowed frieze; stepped fillet with composition beading; cove frieze fillet; cove with composition lamb\u2019s-tongue ornament; and fillet with cove sight molding (fig. 15.44).\n\nPrevious frame (removed in 2008): The work was previously housed in a twentieth-century American reproduction of a Louis XV scotia frame with swept sides and rocaille cartouches at the miters and centers (fig. 15.45).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933): The work was previously housed in an early twentieth-century Louis XV frame with swept sides and foliate rocaille miter and foliate shell center cartouches and an independent liner (fig. 15.46).  \n\nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Possibly sold by the artist to Alexandre Dubourg, Paris, 1873.\n\nPossibly sold by Alexandre Dubourg, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Jan. 9, 1882.\n\nSold to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Apr. 29, 1890, for 1,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, July 8, 1891, for 5,000 francs.\n\nSold by Potter Palmer, Chicago, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Nov. 23, 1894, for $2,500.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

See curatorial file, Art Institute of Chicago. Previously, The Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil has been dated 1872; see, for example, New York, Durand-Ruel Galleries, Exposition of Forty Paintings by Claude Monet, Jan. 12\u201327, 1895, cat. 32.\n\nPaul Hayes Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), pp. 14; 41, n. 5. Tucker calculates that, subtracting the time Monet spent away from Argenteuil, the actual time he spent working on the 180 Argenteuil canvases was closer to four years and eight months.\n\nIn 1872, Durand-Ruel purchased twenty-nine paintings for 9,880 francs, and in 1873, another thirty-four for 19,100 francs. On Durand-Ruel\u2019s purchases, see Paul Hayes Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), p. 24.\n\nIn October 1874, the Monets moved into a brand-new residence on the neighboring property. See Paul Hayes Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), p. 24. Monet had originally hoped to use as a studio the house just behind the one he rented in 1874. Charles F. Stuckey proposes that the annual rent for his second Argenteuil residence, 1,400 francs rather than 1,000, suggests that the new home was bigger; see Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 199.\n\nMuch of the historical background for this essay is drawn from Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet at Argenteuil (Yale University Press, 1982); and Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), quotation on p. 14.\n\nDaniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), pp. 91\u201392.\n\nMonet to Pissarro, Dec. 21, 1871, translated in Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 196; original French in Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), p. 428, letter 61. Whether Monet realized this plan is unknown; what work he conducted in his studio also remains unclear. Stuckey argues that Monet used the studio at 8, rue de l\u2019Isly, for business and storage, citing the lack of paintings from that location as evidence that he did not use the space for painting. See Stuckey, Claude Monet, p. 195. Wildenstein says that Monet did paint at the rue de l\u2019Isly studio, working up, among other things, the Zaandam studies he had brought back from Holland. See Daniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 93.\n\nMme Aubry\u2019s husband, Louis-Eug\u00e8ne Aubry (d. 1870), was the town mayor and a notary in Paris. See Rodolphe Walter, \u201cLes maisons de Claude Monet \u00e0 Argenteuil,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts (Dec. 1966), p. 335. It is also possible that Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, with whom Monet was then close, also encouraged Monet\u2019s decision, as Boudin was later in attendance at the Monets\u2019 housewarming on January 2, 1872. See Catherine Hug and Monika Leonhardt, \u201cClaude Monet the Gardener,\u201d in Monet\u2019s Garden, ed. Christoph Becker, trans. Will Firth, exh. cat. (Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich/Hatje Cantz, 2004), pp. 115; 154, n. 11.\n\nOr 2,662 square meters. Monet lived at 2, rue Pierre Guienne, from December 1871 through June 1874, at which time he moved the family around the corner to a house on the boulevard Saint-Denis, where they remained until January 1878. See Paul Hayes Tucker, Monet at Argenteuil (Yale University Press, 1982), p. 10. The rue Pierre Guienne house was probably built in the eighteenth century and was torn down in 1913. See Catherine Hug and Monika Leonhardt, \u201cClaude Monet the Gardener,\u201d in Monet\u2019s Garden, ed. Christoph Becker, trans. Will Firth, exh. cat. (Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich/Hatje Cantz, 2004), p. 115. The house is described by Mme Aubry as \u201cUne maison \u00e9lev\u00e9e sur caves, rez-de-chauss\u00e9e, un \u00e9tage et grenier,\u201d cited in Rodolphe Walter, \u201cLes maisons de Claude Monet \u00e0 Argenteuil,\u201d Gazette des beaux-arts (Dec. 1966), pp. 335; 342, n. 8.\n\nCharles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 196, citing Monet\u2019s personal account book for 1872.\n\nThe number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThere are two views of the Monets\u2019 second residence in Argenteuil showing the interior and veranda: Un coin d\u2019appartement (1875; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W365]), which depicts Jean with Camille in the background; and Madame Monet Embroidering (1875; Barnes Foundation Museum of Art, Philadelphia [W366]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nMonet married Camille Doncieux in Paris on June 28, 1870, almost three years after their son Jean was born. See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 1 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1974), p. 46.\n\nClare A. P. Willsdon describes in detail the nasturtiums in The Artist's House at Argenteuil, along with the variety of flowers including the exotic, flowering cactus whose red bloom is seen in the foremost vase on the right; see Willsdon, Impressionist Gardens, exh. cat. (National Galleries of Scotland, 2010), pp. 41, 45, 147.\n\nMary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 128.\n\nThe black bow is thinly applied, and the turquoise of the first sash shows through, mitigating the bow\u2019s otherwise somber tone. Gedo interprets the black sash as a possible symbol of impending mourning for Camille\u2019s father, M. Doncieux, since the Art Institute painting was finished just prior to his death on September 22. See Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 128.\n\nAccording to Mary Mathew Gedo, the quality of light and current state of the blooms in the garden suggest that these were both begun in late September. See Mary Mathews Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 129. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nUnlike Seurat\u2019s centrally placed little girl in white in A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884 (1884\u201386; Art Institute of Chicago), Jean, while appearing perfectly still, is understood to be \u201cplaying\u201d with the hoop.\n\nCamille and Jean Monet in the Garden at Argenteuil is alternatively titled Camille au jardin, avec Jean et sa bonne (Camille in the Garden with Jean and His Nanny).\n\nThe number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nAlso seen in The Artist\u2019s Garden at V\u00e9theuil, at the top of the stairs, is a second child who may well be Jacques Hosched\u00e9, the youngest son of Ernest and Alice Hosched\u00e9; by 1878 the Hosched\u00e9 family was sharing a house with the Monets at V\u00e9theuil near Giverny. In the Art Institute\u2019s painting, it is possible that what appears as a pull-cart in the infrared image may also be a hobbyhorse similar to the one Jean rides in Jean Monet on His Hobby Horse from 1872 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W238]). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nWhile The Railway is dated 1873, it has been established that the work was begun in 1872 because the art critic Philippe Burty, recounting a visit to Manet\u2019s studio in the fall of 1872, described the work. Philippe Burty, \u201cLes ateliers,\u201d La renaissance litt\u00e9raire et artistique 1 (1872), pp. 220\u201321, cited in Fran\u00e7oise Cachin and Charles S. Moffett, in collaboration with Michel Melot, Manet, 1832\u20131883, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/Abrams, 1983), p. 340.\n\nThe final outfit appears as a sleeveless, dark-blue duster over a pink dress that is narrow and flat rather than flounced or layered like the walking dresses she wears in other canvases.\n\nThis is true as well in the curious painting at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts already mentioned that depicts a woman, traditionally thought to be Camille but whose identity is, again, less precise. She looks out from the house onto the garden, her figure dwarfed within the darkness of the towering window and the light-filled flowering bushes and pots. One sees the same window box, three horizontal rows of white, blue, and red flowers growing around the perimeter of the building, decorative pots, and the colorful facade that make up the right third of Artist\u2019s House at Argenteuil. Just as the artist decreased the size of the fourth and fifth pots seen in the right foreground of the Art Institute\u2019s composition (see Technical Report), Monet decreased the size of the center pot in the Virginia Museum of Fine Art\u2019s picture.\n\nThe yellow lines at the back of the paved area are likely remnants of two chairs, which were perhaps comparable to the yellow bamboo-style chairs seen in early domestic interiors by Monet (e.g., Le D\u00e9jeuner, 1868; St\u00e4del Museum [W132]), and in the 1876 painting by Renoir, Alfred Sisley (Art Institute of Chicago). The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nClare A. P. Willsdon sees this as an image of familial harmony in which Jean \u201cis allowed to discover for himself the garden\u2019s colours and sensations,\u201d with Camille at the door \u201clooking implicitly at Monet, at his easel where the viewer stands.\u201d See Willsdon, Impressionist Gardens, exh. cat. (National Galleries of Scotland, 2010), pp. 146\u201347, cat. 18. Paul Hayes Tucker, on the other hand, describes Monet as treating Jean as \u201cquizzical, more often aloof\u201d and Camille as \u201cthe disengaged Parisian or the stranger whom one encounters unexpectedly or awkwardly. Or she is the precious flower in the garden, tantalizing but untouchable.\u201d See Tucker, The Impressionists at Argenteuil, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art/Yale University Press, 2000), p. 38. See also Joel Isaacson, Claude Monet: Observation and Reflection (Phaidon/Dutton, 1978), pp. 205\u201306, where Isaacson interprets this painting as a commentary on familial estrangement. Mary Mathews Gedo argues that this painting \u201cexemplifies a pattern that Monet would invariably follow when depicting mother and child as emotionally, if not physically, distant from one another.\u201d See Gedo, Monet and His Muse: Camille Monet in the Artist\u2019s Life (University of Chicago Press, 2010), p. 128. While this painting and other figure compositions of the 1870s have been largely viewed through an autobiographical lens, John House argues that these compositions should rather be understood as \u201ca rejection of stereotyped images of courtship and parenthood, in favour of more open-ended, ambiguous images of human relationships.\u201d See House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1986), p. 34.\n\nRenoir was a regular visitor at Argenteuil; see Charles F. Stuckey, with the assistance of Sophia Shaw, Claude Monet, 1840\u20131926, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Thames &amp; Hudson, 1995), p. 197.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture includes cobalt blue, viridian, vermilion, and zinc white; other pigments may also be present.

See, for example, Jean Monet on His Hobby Horse (1872; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [W238]). Although these circular forms are not visible in the X-ray, two curving, radio-opaque brushstrokes just to the upper right in the X-ray are suggestive of the upper arcs of two additional circular forms. The number preceded by a W refers to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nIn addition, a curved ridge of paint from the earlier painting of the face, which remains visible on the surface in raking light, could be an indication of the woman\u2019s mouth.\n\nZinc white and Naples yellow were detected in localized areas of the painting, both together and separately, and seem to be associated with final touches added by the artist, which may have been carried out some time after the work was painted (see fig. 15.29)\n\nNaples yellow and zinc white were detected in localized areas of the painting, both together and separately, and seem to be associated with final touches added by the artist, which may have been carried out some time after the work was painted (see fig. 15.29).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, vermilion, cobalt blue (SEM/EDX, PLM, XRF); zinc white, cadmium yellow (PLM, XRF, electron microprobe); bone black, chrome yellow, iron oxide yellow, emerald green, viridian (PLM, XRF); Naples yellow (XRF, electron microprobe); ultramarine blue, cerulean blue, red lake (PLM). PLM analysis also indicated the possible presence of iron oxide red and burnt sienna. SEM/EDX analysis detected one particle of carbon black, probably charcoal. Fine black particles were observed in cross sections but could not be identified by SEM/EDX. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. Paint scrapings taken in 1976 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Several of the samples were analyzed by electron microprobe in 1978.

Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.
