They were used frequently in the 19th century, before the widespread use of color photography, and, although few know the craft today, remain a useful educational tool. This found arrangement recalls drawing studies done by artists since the Renaissance. In Struth\u2019s words, the image also offers a meditation on the medical world as \u201cone field of technology, where the different interpretations of existence\u2014physical, psychological, spiritual\u2014come together or clash.\u201d</p>\n",
