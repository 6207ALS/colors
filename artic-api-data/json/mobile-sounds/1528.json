    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Although the title of this painting, &quot;Silver Sun,&quot; refers to the natural world, Arthur Dove was not interested in literal representation in his work. He was one of the first Americans to paint completely abstract images, following an eye-opening trip to Paris in the first decade of the 20th century. Here, roughly concentric circles fill the area where the sky would be. A dark, slightly curved shape sits at the bottom, like a horizon. The work almost hums with visual vibration, and glistens with real metallic paint.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The artist enjoyed a long friendship with Alfred Stieglitz, the collector, art dealer and photographer. It was a productive working relationship, one that offered Dove both financial security and public exposure. Stieglitz's wife, Georgia O'Keeffe, gave the Art Institute a portion of Stieglitz's collection, including many of Dove's works spanning his entire career. You can see several examples in this gallery.</p>\n",
