    "description": "<p>An enlarged figurative aesthetic does not have to be grounded only in forms found in nature; it can also be borrowed from disciplines such as the culinary arts and medicine. An example of the former is Fernando and Humberto Campana\u2019s <em>Sushi Chair</em>, produced by Edra. The chair is mostly handcrafted and made in a manner that is similar to the assembly of a sushi roll. The fabric is rolled, mechanically sewn together, and cut, before the entire unit is flipped to its upright position. The oversize <em>Sushi Chair</em> is emblematic of the Campana brothers\u2019 anti-intellectual approach and their interest in handcrafted techniques that yield aesthetically unique, inventive designs.</p>\n",
