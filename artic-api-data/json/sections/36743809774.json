A warp-thread match was detected with Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather (1900; 1984.1173 [W1557]) (cat. 38), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The ground consists of a single, off-white layer. A light-toned, brushmarked underpainting layer was broadly applied in the sky and the foreground area of the water. The central area of the painting (the landscape, the village, and the reflections), on the other hand, were painted directly on top of the ground layer, which remains exposed in small areas through breaks in the open network of brushstrokes. For the most part, the paint was relatively thinly applied, often lightly dragged across the surface in strokes that accentuate the texture of the underlying canvas weave. Slightly thicker, brushmarked strokes define the features of the hillside and daubs of impasto were used for the light-colored walls of the buildings and their reflections, creating a varied surface texture. The work includes both wet-on-wet and wet-over-dry paint applications, applied in discrete touches of color with very little blending on the canvas. A few minor changes were made to some of the buildings in the foreground of the village, which seem to be related to slight shifts in position or changes in size.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 42.1).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1901 (lower left corner, in orange-red paint) (fig. 42.2). Traces of similar paint to the left of the C suggest that the signature was initially started in a slightly lower position and closer to the left edge. It also appears that the final C was started with a paler orange paint, then gone over with the deeper orange that was used for the rest of the signature and date (fig. 42.3). The underlying paint layers were dry when the painting was signed and dated.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 89 \u00d7 92 cm. This slightly wider than square format is not a standard size; both dimensions, however, correspond to standard stretcher-bar lengths.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 16.8V (0.7) \u00d7 19.9H (0.6) threads/cm; the horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with Waterloo Bridge, Gray Weather (1900; 1984.1173 [W1557]) (cat. 38).\n\nThere is mild, fairly even cusping along all four edges. The cusping pattern appears to correspond to the placement of the original tacks.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1973\u201374 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced 7\u201310 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced 5\u20137 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.7 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: The pre-1973/74-treatment stretcher may have been the original stretcher. An undated report in the conservation file describes the previous stretcher as a Buck type 2, six-membered, including horizontal and vertical crossbars, with keyable mortise and tenon joints and beveled at the back. The report gives the following dimensions: overall, 89.5 \u00d7 93 cm; outside depth, 1.7 cm; width, 6.5 cm; inside depth, 1.6 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 6.5 cm (fig. 42.4).\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of a single layer that ranges from approximately 30 to 100 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 42.5).\n\nColor\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark and possibly red or brown particles visible under magnification (fig. 42.6).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of iron oxide, silica, and silicates. Binder: oil (estimated).\n\nCompositional Planning/Underdrawing/Painted Sketch\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe village, landscape, and reflections in the water were all painted directly on top of the ground, whereas a relatively thick, textured underpainting was applied in the area of the sky and the foreground water. This selectively applied underlayer appears light in color and mostly covers the ground. It is evident when the work is viewed in transmitted light, which reveals that the painting is more translucent in the central area and more thickly built up in the top and bottom sections (fig. 42.7). The broadly applied, sweeping strokes of the underpainting in the sky and the water are visible in the X-ray (fig. 42.8), and the texture of these brushstrokes remains evident on the paint surface through the thinner, more flatly applied layers painted on top (fig. 42.9, fig. 42.10). Where the underpainting is visible through breaks and abrasion in the upper paint layers, it ranges in color from off-white to pale blue (fig. 42.11, fig. 42.12). The crisp ridges of the underlying brushstrokes were not disturbed by the subsequent buildup of paint, suggesting that there was some passage of time between the application of the underpainting and the upper paint layers (fig. 42.13).\n\nThe buildings and landscape, and their reflections, were built up using relatively open brushwork that leaves small patches of exposed ground visible throughout. The hillside consists of long, directional strokes of discrete color applied wet-on-wet with little blending of the strokes (fig. 42.14). In the execution of the hill, the earliest brushwork\u2014likely associated with the initial lay-in\u2014was lightly applied, often just hitting the peaks of the canvas weave; the surface was then built up using a more loaded brush that left thicker ridges of paint, as well as some final strokes, lightly applied, that skip across the surface revealing colors from underneath (fig. 42.15). Along the horizon, the artist moved back and forth between the sky and the landscape. For example, basic indications of the trees and church steeple were made over the textured underpainting of the sky; the purples and blues of the sky were then brought down around these features, with thicker strokes used to build up the foliage and the steeple, which was applied last, on top of the sky (fig. 42.16, fig. 42.17). Magnification reveals that some areas of foliage were composed from an array of superimposed strokes of discrete, often vivid, color (fig. 42.18). The general forms of the architecture were indicated with some very light, cursory brushwork. The landscape passes underneath the edges of the buildings, which indicates that it was built up, for the most part, before the buildings were developed (fig. 42.19, fig. 42.20). The buildings were often articulated using a combination of light, sketchy brushstrokes (such as the vermilion strokes used to delineate the rooftops) juxtaposed with thick, impasted, lead white\u2013rich strokes (mainly for the light-colored walls) (fig. 42.21, fig. 42.22). Final details, such as the windows of the tall, thin, yellow building on the left side, were added wet-in-wet (fig. 42.23). The area occupied by the reflection was mapped out early on: both the underpainting and the blue and purple tones of the water stop roughly at the border between the water and the reflection. The ground layer remains visible through the open brushwork of the reflection (fig. 42.24). The forms reflected in the water were built up in a network of individual, short, mainly horizontal strokes (fig. 42.25).\n\nMinor alterations were made to some of the buildings in the foreground of the village. On the right side, in the area of the blue-roofed house and the red-roofed one to the immediate left, there are two roughly square shapes and a strong horizontal stroke between them that are visible from beneath the surface (fig. 42.26). The thick, directional strokes of these underlying forms are visible in the X-ray (fig. 42.27), and their texture remains evident on the surface of the painting, particularly when viewed in raking light. The paint appears to be off-white in color. The underlying brushwork may constitute part of the early lay-in of the composition and thus indicate slight shifts in position or size between the initial planning of the houses and the painting of them. In the building on the far left, the X-ray seems to indicate the presence of a second pitched roof to the right of the one visible in the final composition. This was subsequently painted over (fig. 42.28).\n\nThe vertical canvas threads are sometimes more pronounced, probably the result of the sweeping horizontal strokes of the paint buildup, which emphasize the canvas texture in that direction. Areas of paint around the edges of the composition appear slightly flattened, as if the work was framed when the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes, including 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes); a broader 2.0 cm wide brush was used for the underpainting in the sky and water. A few brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, ultramarine blue, cobalt blue, and cobalt violet. UV fluorescence of some of the red strokes suggests the presence of red lake throughout the landscape.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a thin, even, synthetic varnish that was applied in 1974 (see Conservation History). The surface is relatively matte with subtle variations in surface sheen depending on the qualities of the underlying paint. The 1974 treatment report states that the painting previously had a discolored, yellowed, soft resin varnish; its origin is unknown.\n\nIn 1973\u201374, a discolored surface film was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nOverall, the painting is in very good condition. It is wax-resin lined and the canvas is stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher. There are no planar deformations. There is some wear around the edges of the canvas and a small hole at the upper right corner. There is a moderate amount of cracking and small losses in the ground layer on the tacking edges. There is some slight flattening of impastoed paint, which is probably related to the lining procedure. Minor retouching around the edges is related to abrasion and tiny losses, especially at the top and the lower left edges. There are wax-resin residues from the lining adhesive around the edges. There is a significant amount of starch-paste residue from the facing used during the lining process embedded in the recesses of the paint texture. This is mainly visible only under magnification, but has a subtle effect on the painting where it is more concentrated, scattering the light by causing those areas to look lighter. The synthetic varnish coating has an even, relatively matte surface that varies slightly according to the surface qualities of the underlying paint.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1991): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American reproduction of a Louis XIII torus frame with carved centered flowers on a laurel-and-berry garland with acanthus-leaf miters, plain hollow, and carved ribbon ornament and cove at the sight (APF, Inc., New York, 1991). The frame is water gilded over brown bole on gesso. The hollow is burnished with selective burnishing on the carved ornament. The gold has been heavily rubbed overall and toned with thin oil paint washes, casein washes, and dark flecking. The carved basswood moldings are mitered and nailed. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is cushion-shaped dentil molding; torus with carved centered flowers on a laurel-and-berry garland with acanthus-leaf miters; fillet; hollow; fillet; torus with carved ribbon; and cove at the sight (fig. 42.29).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975, removed 1991): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, L-shaped narrow frame with a gilded face on a mahogany molding with exposed splines at the miters. The frame may be a design by James L. Speyer (fig. 42.30).\n\nPrevious frame: Sometime between 1956 and 1962 (based on an approximate date of an archival photograph (fig. 42.31), the work was mounted together with the Art Institute\u2019s other version of V\u00e9theuil in a painted shadow box. The paintings\u2019 stretchers were mounted to the back panel of the frame with the edges of the canvas exposed. This frame was probably only utilized during this installation.  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Boussod, Valadon &amp; Cie., Paris, Feb. 15, 1902, for 8,000 francs.\n\nSold by Boussod, Valadon &amp; Cie., Paris, to Rosenberg, Paris, May 26, 1903, for 10,000 francs.\n\nAcquired by Alfred Savoir, Paris, by Mar. 22, 1922.\n\nSold at the Alfred Savoir, Paris, sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, Mar. 22, 1922, lot 16 (ill.), to Durand-Ruel, Paris, for 5,000 francs.\n\nOn deposit from Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, by Apr. 22, 1922.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Apr. 22, 1922.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn, Chicago, Sept. 29, 1926, for $10,000.\n\nBequeathed by Mrs. Lewis Larned (Annie Swan) Coburn (died 1932), Chicago, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1933.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Bernheim-Jeune, Oeuvres r\u00e9centes de Camille Pissarro et nouvelle s\u00e9rie de Claude Monet, Feb. 20\u201328, 1902.\n\nNew York, Brooklyn Museum, Paintings by Contemporary English and French Painters, Nov. 29, 1922\u2013Jan. 2, 1923, cat. 179, as Vetheuil, Messrs.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture includes lead white, vermilion, and viridian. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_447\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 21, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_analtyical\\_report,\" June 9, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, V\u00e9theuil (W1643/1933.447),\u201d Dec. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the canvases for the two paintings were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: W1557, W1643,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct. 15, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_447\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 21, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, viridian, vermilion, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). XRF analysis detected cobalt and arsenic in areas of purple paint, indicating that the cobalt violet is a cobalt arsenate. PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scraping samples taken in 1977 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_447\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" Oct, 15, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Vetheuil\\_33\\_447\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Apr. 21, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
