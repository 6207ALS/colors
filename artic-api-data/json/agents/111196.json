    "description": "<p>One of the most prominent African American designers of the 20th century, Charles Harrison transformed postwar living in the US with his modern designs for durable and affordable household products. During his 32-year career at the Chicago-based retailer Sears, Roebuck, and Co., Harrison designed over 750 objects for nearly every area of the home, including hair dryers, kitchen appliances, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/205463/kenmore-sewing-machine\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sewing machines</a><span>, lawn mowers, and the country\u2019s first plastic trash can.</span></p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7c01643d-7fff-efe8-29c4-343265c130b4\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br></span><span>After studying industrial design at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) with professor and mentor </span><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/47473/henry-peter-glass\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Henry P. Glass</span></a><span> and serving in the United States Army, Harrison worked as a designer for a number of Chicago-based companies in the mid-1950s. One transformative early project was his acclaimed 1959 redesign for the popular toy </span><a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/205464/view-master-model-g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span>View-Master</span></a><span>, a stereoscope device originally introduced at the 1939 New York World\u2019s Fair and used by the military in WWII. Harrison\u2019s updated\u2014and now iconic\u2014model replaced the dark brown, blocky unit with lightweight, brightly colored, injection-molded plastic, making the device less costly and easier to use, especially for children. The View-Master epitomizes Harrison\u2019s approach to design, which was based on problem solving and a keen attention to the experience of the user rather than predetermined aesthetic goals.</span></p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7c01643d-7fff-efe8-29c4-343265c130b4\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br></span>In 1961 Harrison was hired as the first black designer at Sears, Roebuck, and Co., and rose through the ranks to become the head of the company\u2019s design group. As part of his lifelong commitment to education and professional development, Harrison completed a master\u2019s degree in art education at L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9328/bauhaus-chicago-design-in-the-city\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Institute of Design</a> in 1963 and, after his retirement in 1993, taught design at SAIC, University of Illinois Chicago, and Columbia College Chicago. He was president of the Chicago chapter of the International Designers Society of America and involved with the Organization of Black Designers. In recognition of his impactful and groundbreaking career, Harrison received a lifetime achievement award from the Smithsonian\u2019s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in 2008 and an honorary doctorate from SAIC in 2009.</p>",
