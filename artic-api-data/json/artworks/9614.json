A shadowy figure lurks at the composition\u2019s darkened right edge, an unknown presence encroaching on the comforts of the sitting room. Kantor later recalled that such a setting, with \u201cits peculiar moldy smell, the fading beauty of old plaster discolored by time and living . . . turned my imagination to the past, to the people who had lived there and gone.\u201d A Russian immigrant, the artist engaged with the stories and objects of American history as catalysts for his Surrealist, dreamlike musings.</p>\n",
