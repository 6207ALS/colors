    "description": "<p>In this work, Mary Cassatt addressed the theme for which she is best known\u2014women and children\u2014while also experimenting with compositional elements of Japanese art. Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. <em>The Child\u2019s Bath</em> is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt\u2019s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.</p>\n",
