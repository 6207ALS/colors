When Whistler received the commission to do a portrait of Mallarm\u00e9 for the volume, he made and destroyed a number of studies on thin, transparent transfer paper. He selected two drawings for transferring and printing, this one and St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, No. 2 (cat. 59). Ultimately, the latter was rejected for publication and the current image was printed by the Belfond firm for inclusion in the first three editions of Vers et Prose. According to T. R. Way (1912, 1913), the edition was pulled entirely from the original stone. This was contrary to Whistler\u2019s usual practice of having his images transferred to supplementary stones from which large editions could be pulled, leaving the original stones in good condition should he choose to print small editions later. If Way\u2019s information is accurate, the stone bearing this delicate portrait held up remarkably well during printing; it is difficult today to make clear qualitative distinctions between \u201cproof\u201d impressions and those printed as part of the published edition.\n\nThere is clear evidence that both Whistler and Mallarm\u00e9 considered this image extremely successful. When Mallarm\u00e9 first saw an impression of the small portrait, he immediately sent off a letter to the artist with the comment: \u201cThis portrait is a marvel, the best thing that has ever been done of me, and I am delighted with it.\u201d Whistler continued to take pride in the lithograph; in October 1894, when he finally mailed an impression to the Ways, he wrote: \u201cYou have never seen it then?It is very beautiful\u2014and as a portrait of the poet extraordinary\u201d (letter 123). His fondness for the image was also manifest in his marketing decisions. By November 1894 Whistler had raised the price for the portrait to six guineas, the highest figure he was then asking for any of his lithographs. St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 was not included in the exhibition of Whistler\u2019s lithographs that opened at the Fine Art Society in December 1895, probably because the artist did not wish to part with his remaining impressions. When Whistler died, there were only five impressions remaining in his estate.\n\nAlthough Paul Gauguin, Edvard Munch, and Auguste Renoir all produced portraits of Mallarm\u00e9 that are far more commanding than Whistler\u2019s simple sketch, the evocative quality of his portrait was greatly admired by the poet\u2019s friends and acquaintances. In 1903 Arthur Symons wrote: \u201cThere is a [lithographic] drawing of Mallarm\u00e9 . . . which, to those who knew him, recalls the actual man as no other portrait does. It is faint, evasive, a mist of lines and spaces that seem like some result of happy accident.\u201d In 1904 Th\u00e9odore Duret said of the portrait: \u201cThose who have known him can believe they hear him speak. Nevertheless the image exists only as a breath. It is built up by the most rapid pencil strokes. It is an improvisation, and yet one does not improvise so striking a rendering of a human being; it is necessary to have penetrated him profoundly to give him with this intensity of life and character.\u201d\n\nThere are deceptive facsimiles of Whistler\u2019s lithograph that were issued with the fourth and subsequent editions of Vers et Prose. Printed in darker gray or black ink on mounted wove paper, these photomechanically printed reproductions have often been catalogued as original lithographs. Under magnification they can be distinguished by the distinctly granular quality of the printed surface, by roulette marks strengthening the lightest areas, and sometimes by a platemark.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (169 \u00d7 137 mm). Glasgow: HAG (3), cream laid paper (201 \u00d7 155 mm), with crayon trials on the stone, lower right; cream laid paper (203 \u00d7 156 mm); grayish ivory chine (132 \u00d7 106 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (316 \u00d7 224 mm).

The first three French editions of Vers et Prose contained impressions of the lithograph printed by Belfond on grayish ivory chine mounted on off-white plate paper that bears the printer\u2019s blind stamp. Belfond apparently printed a total of 2,450 impressions\u20141,350 for the first edition and 1,100 for the second and third editions\u2014in 1892 and 1893. According to the publisher\u2019s livre de fabrication there were an additional twenty-five copies of the first edition on Hollande paper and ten copies on Japon. Many impressions have been removed from the bound books; some of these have been trimmed while other still show evidence of stitch marks along the right edge of the secondary sheet. According to Way (1912) and Way (1913), the published edition of this image was pulled from the original stone.\n\nChicago: AIC (2), grayish ivory chine (119 \u00d7 77 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (186 \u00d7 129 mm), with blind stamp, bound into 1893 edition of Vers et Prose, flyleaf inscribed, in Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s hand, To G.

CVII.\n\nWhistler had promised an impression to Way in November 1892 (letter 37), almost two years earlier. The impression he finally sent in 1894 must be the inscribed impression now in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nIn a letter to Edward Kennedy of November 1894, Whistler mentioned that he had only five or six impressions of the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait left; NYPL 1/18.\n\nSt\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 is listed as no. 47 in the exhibition catalogue; app. V.1. Whistler initially had consigned impressions of the Mallarm\u00e9 portrait to the Fine Art Society, but wrote to Ernest Faulkner Brown in late November 1895 asking for them to be returned; GUL F256. By this time Whistler probably did not have the option of having more impressions pulled from the stone. His relations with Belfond had ceased the year before and, according to information recorded by Barbier, Whistler had given the stone to the publisher; Barbier (1964), p. 188 n. 2.\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 44.\n\nArthur Symons, \u201cFine Arts: Whistler, III,\u201d The Weekly Critical Review: Devoted to Literature, Music and the Fine Arts 2 (13 August 1903), p. 81.\n\nDuret (1904), p. 124; translated in Duret (1917), p. 84.\n\nBarbier (1964), pp. 188 n. 2, 190\u201391 n. 3.
