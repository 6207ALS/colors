    "description": "<p>This print is an example of the many large-scale <em>surimono</em> that Shibata Zeshin created during the Meiji period (1868\u20131912). These differ from the smaller <em>surimono</em> in this exhibition in several ways. Smaller <em>surimono</em> usually displayed poetry made by a small group of poets that lived in the same location and belonged to the same group. They also carried a strong seasonal component and were typically created for a specific time of year, such as the New Year, or a significant date for the group, such as a retirement, birthday, or important visitor from afar.</p>\n<p>The larger prints retained this seasonal component but took on stronger commemorative roles by including bigger groups of people, sometimes unrelated to the poetry club. In this print, the host is Tchikubai, possibly a poetry teacher with a sizable group of students.</p>\n",
