The sitter for both portraits was his wife, Beatrix, who in La Belle Dame endormie is shown sleeping in one of the slipcovered armchairs in the Whistlers\u2019 drawing room at 110, rue du Bac. When the artist sent the two drawings to his printers on September 23, he gave the lithograph the title La Dormeuse and identified it as \u201cNo. 2,\u201d while La Robe rouge was designated \u201cNo. 1.\u201d This very likely refers to the order in which the two drawings were created the night before.\n\nThe first proofs of the two portraits and of La Fruiti\u00e8re de la rue de Grenelle (cat. 106) were sent to Whistler by the Ways on September 25. In the letter that accompanied the shipment, Thomas Way complained about the \u201cflimsy\u201d loose sheets of papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal on which the drawings had been executed, for there were, as he put it, many \u201cflaws in the material\u201d (letter 123). These loose sheets of smooth French transfer paper had recently been prepared especially for Whistler by Lemercier in Paris. As Way predicted in his letter, however, the minor technical defects in this image did not trouble Whistler, who, when he wrote to the printers on or around October 1, ordered forty impressions of La Dormeuse on \u201cchoice sheets of small Dutch [paper]\u201d and added the parenthetical statement that \u201cthis is certainly, at present, my favorite lithograph\u201d (letter 125). Two weeks later he wrote that Way \u201cought to like it beyond any lithograph I have done\u2014I do!\u201d (letter 126). Almost a year later, in late September of 1895, La Belle Dame endormie was still among the artist\u2019s preferred lithographs. He recommended that the Ways include it in the group of lithographs they were submitting on his behalf to the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d exhibition in Paris (letter 138), and then reprimanded them when the image (as well as others he had suggested) was not included in their final selection (letter 141).\n\nDespite his favorable opinion of this lithograph, it seems that Whistler became reluctant to part with impressions later in life, perhaps because the image held painful associations with his wife\u2019s illness. There were twenty-five impressions of La Belle Dame endormie in his estate when he died, and the stone is one of the few that Rosalind Birnie Philip ordered Goulding to destroy without pulling a posthumous edition.\n\nChicago: AIC, grayish white chine (205 \u00d7 159 mm) mounted on white plate paper (345 \u00d7 251 mm); Palmer, ivory wove proofing paper (287 \u00d7 223 mm), inscribed in lithographic crayon at lower right within the image, in Whistler\u2019s hand, No. 2, and at lower left, in an unidentified hand, 1st before etching, in graphite but erased; SC, ivory laid paper (219 \u00d7 198 mm), signed.

One line runs from Beatrix\u2019s left cheek, down across her shoulder and elbow, through the skirt of the chair cover, and into the shadow on the floor; the other line can be seen faintly at the high point of her crossed knee and running down through a patch of shadow on her skirt below.
