    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: One of the key moments in the Christian story is pictured here, the Angel Gabriel's announcement to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God. Curator Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>MARTHA WOLFF: We see the Virgin Mary kneeling at a prayer desk, and the Angel Gabriel floating in from the left in a rather elegant room, and we see also the dove of the Holy Ghost descending on her. And one thing that's very interesting about the picture is that the Angel Gabriel and the Virgin don't quite engage each other the way you would expect in this story. The open gesture of her hands indicates her response, but her gaze isn't directed at Gabriel himself.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Mary looks off to the left side of the painting where a glimpse of an outside wall and patch of grass suggest that there was once more to it than we see now. In fact, the painting was once part of a long, horizontal altarpiece painted around 1490 by the artist Jean Hey, probably for a member of the French royal family. The room in which this scene is set gives us a fascinating insight into how a lady's private chamber would have looked at the time.</p>\n",
