He was working on his portrait of Madame Clapisson (cat. 17), his sole submission to the Salon that year, requiring approval by its patron and shippment to the jury by the second week of March. At the same time, he was preparing for a solo exhibition that was to open April 1 in galleries specially renovated by the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel on the boulevard de la Madeleine, near the busy traffic hub of the place de la Madeleine. Soon after he began Madame L\u00e9on Clapisson, Renoir anticipated painting a portrait of two-and-a-half-year-old Lucie Berard. As he wrote to her father, Paul, as early as January or February 1883: \u201cI have begun the second \u2018edition\u2019 of Madame Clapisson. . . . This will allow me to get my hand back so that I can start on Lucie as soon as you arrive.\u201d It seems certain the portrait of Lucie would have been included in the retrospective exhibition if it had been ready. Colin Bailey has suggested that its execution followed the exhibition and occurred sometime before Renoir\u2019s trip to Guernsey in September, possibly on a quick visit to Wargemont for Lucie\u2019s third birthday on July 10, on his way to nearby Yport that summer.\n\nIn the preface to the catalogue for Renoir\u2019s 1883 retrospective, the art critic Th\u00e9odore Duret proclaimed the artist to be the figure painter of Impressionism, who portrayed women with delicacy and excelled in portraiture. Two full-length dance paintings included in the exhibition, Dance in the City and Dance in the Country (both 1883; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 440 and 441; Dauberville 1000 and 999]) were ambitious demonstrations of this particular gift. Duret might also have added that Renoir was a skilled painter of childhood, a specialization highlighted in the first gallery of the exhibition, which opened the retrospective with an installation of some twenty-one images and portraits of children. As Edmond Jacques of L\u2019intransigeant commented, \u201cIs it possible to push further the expression of childhood grace than in the series of paintings that fill the first gallery to the left of the entrance?\u201d The children featured in this section tended to be very young, such as the subject of the first work in the catalogue, Gypsy Girl (La petite boh\u00e9mienne) (1879; private collection [Daulte 291; Dauberville 505]), or of the fourth, six-year-old Jeanne Durand-Ruel (1876; Barnes Collection, Philadelphia [Daulte 179; Dauberville 500]). Paul Berard lent generously to the exhibition, contributing, among others, four portraits of his children to the first gallery: no. 11, Sketches of Heads (The Berard Children) (Croquis de t\u00eates) (fig. 16.1 [Daulte 365; Dauberville 282]); no. 19, a portrait of Margot (fig. 16.2 [Daulte 286; Dauberville 503]); no. 17, the unidentified T\u00eate d\u2019enfants, possibly a pastel; and no. 20, another unidentified work, simply titled Portrait.\n\nThe year 1883 proved to be a decisive one for Renoir and indeed for the commercial success of the Impressionist movement as a whole. In addition to his retrospective of seventy works\u2014one of a series of exhibitions that included Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Alfred Sisley\u2014he was represented in Impressionist exhibitions organized by Durand-Ruel in London, Boston, and Berlin. These exhibitions provided unprecedented exposure for the Impressionists and required considerable capital investment, but resistance to their style persisted, and the press reviews remained predominantly negative and uncomprehending. Despite Durand-Ruel\u2019s promotion of his work, Renoir began to experience self-doubt after he moved into a larger studio yet failed to gain a wider clientele for portraits. Paul Berard and his wife adored their portrait of Lucie but had difficulty convincing others of its merits. In December 1883 Berard confided his concerns to a mutual friend, the collector Charles Deudon: \u201cAs far as Renoir, he is having a crisis of confidence. His vast studio horrifies him and he can do nothing about it; except for the portrait of Mme Clapisson, I have seen nothing new and he has no new commissions. . . . I am overwhelmed by the difficulty one encounters trying to have his painting accepted. . . . Unfortunately for Renoir, we cannot get others to derive the pleasure that we do from his work, and this portrait [Lucie Berard (Child in White)], so different from the type that [Jean-Jacques] Henner paints, simply frightens people away.\u201d\n\nRenoir and Paul Berard had been close friends since 1878, when they probably met at the salon of Marguerite Charpentier. The artist soon took on the role of family portraitist, as he had for the Charpentiers prior to that. As a member of a Protestant banking family and a former diplomat, Berard had deep pockets and a more open mind than many of his station. By the time of his death on March 31, 1905, he had amassed a large collection that included works by Renoir as well as Monet, Sisley, Pissarro, Berthe Morisot, and other participants in the Impressionist exhibitions. Beginning in the summer of 1879, Renoir made frequent visits to the Berard estate in Normandy, near the village of Wargemont, where Lucie and her sister Margot were born. In addition to portraits of the Berard family, Renoir painted landscapes and genre paintings and decorated the dining room and salon of the chateau with still lifes. Of the four Berard children, Lucie would become the most beloved of Renoir. After her birth on July 10, 1880, he portrayed the newborn in a sketch accompanying a letter congratulating Berard for giving him a \u201cnouveau mod\u00e8le\u201d (fig. 16.3). Mary Cassatt also knew the family and made her own pastel likeness of baby Lucie propped uncomfortably in an armchair, dressed in a long presentation gown (fig. 16.4). Family legend has it that Renoir frightened the Berard girls with his teasing and once amused himself by letting the canaries out of their cage, much to girls\u2019 dismay.\n\nThe little girl in the Chicago portrait, Lucie Louise Berard, who evoked for Douglas Druick the \u201cpersonification of attentive innocence,\u201d would grow up during a tumultuous period in European history, living through both world wars and the rise and fall of Charles de Gaulle, and dying in 1977 at the age of ninety-six. In a photograph taken about 1888 (fig. 16.5), she still has the large eyes and unsmiling expression captured in her portrait, but she is now a determined and strong-willed young girl. In April 1905, when she was twenty-four, Lucie wed Jules Edmond David Pieyre Lacombe de Mandiargues, a civil engineer who died at the front in August 1916. She never remarried. One of her two sons, Andr\u00e9, became a prominent novelist and poet. Lucie\u2019s husband bought Renoir\u2019s 1883 portrait of her at the sale of the collection of Paul Berard in May 1905\u2014a perfect wedding present and a memento of her father\u2014but the couple did not own it long. During the financially difficult period leading up to World War I, the painting was sold, and by February 1913 it was in the collection of Martin A. Ryerson (see Provenance).\n\nA small bust portrait of Lucie wearing a white pinafore, painted in early 1884 (fig. 16.6 [Daulte 456; Dauberville 1231]), marked a significant turning point in Renoir\u2019s career following his crise de d\u00e9couragement in 1883. With its emphasis on line, smooth modeling, and controlled brushwork, this portrait is a dramatic departure from the one executed just a year earlier. Writing to inform Berard that it was finished in his \u201cnew manner\u201d and would be the \u201clast word in art,\u201d Renoir provided important insight into the resolution of his crisis: \u201cOne always thinks one has invented the locomotive until the day when one realizes that it doesn\u2019t work. . . . I\u2019m beginning a little late to know how to wait, having had enough failures like this.\u201d This second portrait of Lucie would prove preliminary to Renoir\u2019s valedictory portrait of the Berard sisters, one of the masterpieces of his so-called Ingresque style, Children\u2019s Afternoon at Wargemont (fig. 16.7 [Daulte 457; Dauberville 965]). In his final portrayal of Lucie, Renoir shows her standing with a doll looking warily out at the viewer, a child whose innocence derives from her inability to read or embroider, activities with which her sisters are engaged. She can only draw upon imagination to amuse herself. While family friend Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche described the Berard sisters as \u201cunruly savages who refused to write or spell,\u201d here the girls appear quietly absorbed in their activities. Thus Renoir ended his series of portraits of the family with a painting that commemorates the graciousness of childhood.\n\nWhile the audacious Impressionist execution of Lucie\u2019s portrait may have frightened members of the Berards\u2019 social circle, it was not a completely radical break with tradition. In fact the portrait reflects Renoir\u2019s close attention to the art of the past. In choosing to show Lucie alone in a half-length format, turned slightly to her right, without any of the usual accessories of childhood, Renoir was inspired by an old master painting: Infanta Margarita (fig. 16.8), from the workshop of seventeenth-century Spanish painter Diego Rodr\u00edguez de Silva y Vel\u00e1zquez. In the nineteenth century, this small portrait was considered a highlight of the collection of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre. It shows Vel\u00e1zquez at the height of his power for rendering the soft glow of natural light. For Renoir this painting represented all the ideals he wished to capture in his own painting. Describing it in the early twentieth century to the art dealer Ambroise Vollard, he declared: \u201cWhat I love so much is that aristocratic quality that you find over and over again in Vel\u00e1zquez, in the smallest detail, the simplest ribbon. . . . The whole of painting is in the little pink bow of Infanta Margarita in the Louvre! How lovely the eyes are and the flesh tones near the eyes! There is not the slightest shadow of sentimentality, of mawkishness!\u201d As Lucie shares with the Infanta a pose of graceful serenity, it is clear that childhood innocence without sentimentality was Renoir\u2019s goal as well in the Chicago portrait. Renoir also took on the challenge of the Spanish master\u2019s innovative flesh tones with a colorist\u2019s bravado. Care was taken with finer brushes in the modeling of Lucie\u2019s face in soft pinks and whites; an iridescent, pale yellow is used for shading below her chin and over her neck, possibly in emulation of the glowing flesh tones of the Infanta (see fig. 16.9). Two underdrawing campaigns, the first in black chalk or charcoal and the second in blue paint, hint at changes Renoir might have made to echo Infanta Margarita. The black underdrawing appears to show Lucie\u2019s left forearm raised as if she were holding a doll or toy, but in the blue-painted underdrawing, her arm was moved to hang by her side, closer to the formal pose of the Infanta (fig. 16.10; see Compositional Planning/Underdrawing/Painted Sketch in the technical report).\n\nRenoir\u2019s earlier portrayal of Lucie, in the painting Sketches of Heads (The Berard Children) (fig. 16.1), dated 1881, also references the art of the past. The painting is an exceptional example of collage portraiture, a format that Renoir adopted from the study drawings of eighteenth-century French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. Here Lucie is portrayed as a sleeping baby (upper left), and awake and looking to her right (just to the right of center). In addition to Lucie, the work also depicts her older brother Andr\u00e9 (born 1868; lower left); Marthe (born 1870; center, holding a book, and bottom right); and Margot (born 1874; just to the left of center, reading, and upper right).\n\nCompared to the portrait of Madame Clapisson, Renoir\u2019s 1883 Salon submission, there is an informality about the preparation of Lucie Berard (Child in White) that suggests the circumstances of the commission were quite different. This may have something to do with his payment (the amount he received for the painting of Lucie is not known, though he probably asked much less for a child\u2019s portrait than for an adult\u2019s), but it more likely reflects the Berards\u2019 familiarity with the artist and their level of comfort with the Impressionist technique of broken brushwork and color harmonizations. One remarkable aspect of the work is how the texture of the canvas weave is clearly visible to the naked eye (fig. 16.11). The weave can be seen in the reproduction of the portrait in the 1905 sale catalogue (fig. 16.12), so it was likely apparent early in the history of the painting. The weave of this canvas is much looser and coarser than that of the canvas of Madame L\u00e9on Clapisson, which reveals how easily Renoir could adapt his technique to different canvas types. The canvas edges visible on the back of the stretcher of Lucie\u2019s portrait appear unevenly cut (fig. 16.13), which would be unusual in a canvas prepared by a professional art supplier. The ground layer is pure lead white, does not contain the common additives and extenders found in commercially applied preparations, and was applied only to the compositional area (fig. 16.14; see Preparatory Layers in the technical report). These factors suggest that the artist may have prepared the canvas himself.\n\nRenoir\u2019s use of color in the painting reflects an innovative harmonization. The background progresses from lighter yellows and greens on the right to a deep blue on the left. These background colors resonate with those the artist chose for modeling the figure of Lucie. Could he have intended to suggest an outdoor setting? Following the rejection of his first version of the portrait of Madame Clapisson, he vowed never again to paint portraits en plein air; yet he could only have achieved the intense coloration of Lucie\u2019s portrait by placing her under natural light. For the Berards, the portrait of Lucie was eminently satisfying. After hanging it in the best spot in his study in a beautiful new frame he had specially made for it, Berard wrote to Deudon that he and his wife, Marguerite, \u201cswoon with pleasure in front of it.\u201d  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began this portrait with a standard-size canvas that he may have prepared himself. The raw, stretched canvas has a heavy ground layer, initially applied with a palette knife and then worked into the canvas to the edges of the compositional area with a brush. The thickness of the ground varies throughout and does not hide the canvas texture or its many imperfections, nubs, and varying thread thicknesses. Once the canvas was prepared, the artist made a contour sketch using fine lines in a soft, dry medium, such as natural charcoal or black chalk, to indicate the basic shapes and establish the figure. An additional set of underdrawing lines in fluid blue paint reinforces some of the contours of the head, while changing the arms and the outline of the costume. Renoir moved back and forth between the drawing and painting stages, partially fleshing out at least one earlier position for the arms before returning to establish a new set of contours in blue paint. Parallel to the figure\u2019s right arm, evidence of its previous position\u2014more bent and farther from the body\u2014is visible under normal viewing conditions. This arm was then placed closer to the body, and perhaps pushed backward in space or given a less voluminous sleeve. The figure\u2019s left arm was initially articulated in charcoal farther from the body and bent at the elbow, while a second underdrawing in blue paint places it closer to the body or more forward in space; the artist here settled for a final position between these two earlier placements.\n\nRenoir also made small changes to other areas of the composition, perhaps altering the figure\u2019s hairstyle and raising her eyes from their initial placement in the charcoal drawing. The volume and possibly the shape of the garment near the bottom of the composition were also altered. After establishing the figure, the artist brought in pale background colors immediately around it, perhaps to cover previous compositional choices and underdrawing. These pale colors were then overlaid with heavier paint in tinted blues, making the background appear denser toward the center of the picture.\n\nThe paint is generally full-bodied and paste-like, retaining the mark of the brush and an overall sense of stiff, individual strokes that were applied wet-in-wet and minimally mixed on the canvas, contrasted locally with the smooth, well-blended paint used in the flesh and hair. White impasto highlights for the decorative collar and buttons on the child\u2019s costume appear as final touches to the work.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 16.15).\n\nSigned and dated: Renoir. 83. (upper right, in blue paint) (fig. 16.16, fig. 16.17).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions of the canvas, measuring the primed compositional area, were approximately 60.5 \u00d7 49 cm. This corresponds to a no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size (60 \u00d7 50 cm) canvas; this number is also stenciled on the verso of the stretcher (fig. 16.18).\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 19.8V (0.5) \u00d7 15.3H (0.7) threads/cm. The vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas texture is characterized by threads of uneven thickness and numerous nubs and imperfections. Strong cusping around the edges corresponds to the placement of the original tacks. Along with the presence of priming only in the compositional area, the strength of this cusping suggests that the canvas was stretched before it was primed. The tacking margins do not appear to have been trimmed flush with the back edge of the stretcher and bend around to the verso, especially at the top.\n\nCurrent stretching: The painting was lined and restretched at an unknown date prior to 1968. The dimensions appear to have been increased on all sides and the stretcher tapped out accordingly. The painting was mounted slightly askew, so that paint along the top edge on the right is bent at the foldover. An undated photograph, presumably taken before this lining was applied, shows the painting correctly mounted on its stretcher with no unprimed margin of canvas visible around the edges of the compositional area (see Conservation History) (fig. 16.19).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 5.5\u20137.0 cm apart.\n\nThough the painting was lined and restretched as part of a previous, undocumented conservation treatment, it appears to have retained its original stretcher (see Conservation History). The canvas is tacked to a five-member, blind mortise-and-tenon stretcher with a horizontal crossbar (fig. 16.20). Depth: 2.2 cm.\n\nNumber  \nLocation: stretcher  \nMethod: black stamp/stencil  \nContent: 12 (fig. 16.18)\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nRenoir applied the ground to the compositional area after the canvas was stretched. The ground is thicker in the center, tapering out toward the perimeter, and may have been applied in successive layers (fig. 16.21). Cross-sectional analysis suggests the ground is generally approximately 10\u2013160 \u00b5m thick, and as much as 300 \u00b5m thick in some areas. Sharp marks in the X-ray suggest that the thicker areas of the ground were worked into the canvas with a palette knife, but the softness of the perimeter suggests brush application. It is likely that the bulk of the preparation was applied with a palette knife, and then a brush was used to smooth the ground out to the edges and around the various canvas imperfections. Despite the apparent thickness of the ground in some areas, the preparation layer often leaves the canvas texture visible (fig. 16.22).\n\nThe ground is white; no colored particles were observed under stereomicroscopic examination or cross-sectional analysis.\n\nThe ground is lead white with traces of alumina, calcium-based white, and complex silicates (fig. 16.23). The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nThe artist seems to have outlined the major features of the figure, including the most prominent elements of the face and parts of the costume, directly on top of the ground before painting.\n\nInfrared examination shows that Renoir loosely established the major contours of the figure and costume with long, sweeping, somewhat sketchy lines. Faint lines intermittently outlining the basic shapes are extremely fine and appear wider in some areas where they were reinforced by the artist. This initial set of underdrawing lines appears to have been done in a soft, dry medium, possibly charcoal or chalk (fig. 16.24). This medium contains large black pigment particles that were brought into subsequent paint layers and can be seen microscopically in the whites of the figure\u2019s eyes under normal viewing conditions (fig. 16.25). In some places, the drawing material appears to catch only the thread tops, but in most areas, the softness of the medium allowed it to reach both the high and the low points in the canvas weave.\n\nElsewhere, and likely after the initial sketch, Renoir outlined some of the features in dark-blue paint, including the contours of the costume. It is unclear, however, whether these outlines were a separate compositional planning stage or the beginning of the painting stage, and therefore less visible in some areas because they were brought into the upper paint layers. At the figure\u2019s left shoulder, a blue outline remains visible through the translucent upper paint layers and can be seen under normal viewing conditions (fig. 16.26).\n\nRenoir seems to have altered the pose of the figure at least twice before settling on the visible arrangement of the arms. After making a very general sketch that established the placement of the figure, the artist continued with thin charcoal or black-chalk lines to define the head and hair, the facial features, and the general outline of the body. The second set of apparent underdrawing lines, in blue paint, seems to indicate a different position of the child\u2019s arms and sleeves. There are also summary lines, both painted and drawn, indicating changes in the volume and shape of the bottom of the child\u2019s garment, though their exact compositional impact is not entirely clear.\n\nAfter establishing the composition with black lines, Renoir painted the eyes slightly higher than in the drawing, farther away from the nose and mouth (fig. 16.27). Additionally, the positions of both arms appear to have been altered between the drawing and painting stages. Black charcoal or chalk lines indicating the figure\u2019s left arm suggest that it was originally bent, with the hand even higher than the right one. The artist abandoned this choice between the first and second drawing campaigns, as the subsequent sketch in blue paint shows the child\u2019s left arm extended, as in the final composition.\n\nRenoir used blue paint to outline some of the features of the clothing and to alter the positions of the sleeves while leaving the head unchanged. Blue painted lines indicating the figure\u2019s left arm show it both in its current position and farther toward the center of the picture. The figure\u2019s right arm appears to have been articulated at least twice before the artist established its current placement. In one version, the right shoulder appears raised, with the elbow bent so that the arm is farther away from the body and the hand slightly higher than in the final composition. In another version, the shoulder is in the same position as in the final composition, while the sleeve curves and tapers toward the body below the elbow, somewhat mirroring the final orientation of the left arm; compared to this sketch, the final version of the right arm appears to have been pushed backward in space, with less volume in the sleeve (fig. 16.28).\n\nRenoir seems to have moved back and forth between compositional planning and painting throughout the execution of this work, since many of the changes associated with painted lines visible in infrared images and under microscopic examination reveal at least limited heavier brushstrokes in raking and specular light. Additionally, the final placement of the arms has a corresponding underdrawing in thin blue paint. The X-ray, though visually complicated by the vigorous application of the ground, indicates that the artist may initially have parted the child\u2019s hair in the center and swept it off to either side in the front. As a result, the front sections of the hair may have rested farther down on the forehead. The initial set of black underdrawing lines indicates that the eyes were once lower as well. Aside from the possible change in hairstyle and the position of the eyes for the finished composition, there appear to have been no other changes to the head and face.\n\nWhile Renoir began by sketching in black charcoal or chalk, it appears he reinforced and revised the composition with thin lines in blue paint, some of which appear to have been partially fleshed out in heavier paint before further alteration. Echoes of the earlier placement of the figure\u2019s right shoulder can still be seen running parallel to its final location, despite the addition of background paint in this area. After establishing the figure, the artist probably began the background in thinner, almost wash-like layers of blue, pink, and possibly yellow in a kind of aureole immediately surrounding the figure, before adding heavier layers of darker, tinted blues (fig. 16.29). This initial application of the background may have served to cover varying earlier compositional choices, and as a result, the background appears denser toward the center of the picture (fig. 16.30).\n\nIn many areas, the paint is of a paste-like consistency that retains brush marks and accentuates the underlying textures of canvas and previous brushstrokes (fig. 16.31). Various colors appear for the most part to have been blended on the canvas rather than on the artist\u2019s palette (fig. 16.32). Renoir complemented the individual strokes seen throughout much of the costume and background with the smoothly blended painting of the flesh tones and the hair (fig. 16.33). Final touches of thick white impasto indicate the decorative collar and buttons on the figure\u2019s garment and the highlights in her eyes (fig. 16.34).\n\nSmall to medium brushes, round and flat, with strokes up to about 1 cm wide; palette knife for ground application.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, vermilion, two red lakes, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, bone black, zinc yellow,, and iron oxide yellow and/or red and possibly burnt sienna.\n\nThe observation of a characteristic salmon-colored fluorescence under UV light suggests the presence of a fluorescing red lake in the hair, flesh tones, and parts of the figure\u2019s dress (fig. 16.35).\n\nPolarized light microscopy (PLM) indicates that the background blue is composed of predominantly cobalt blue with some ultramarine blue (fig. 16.36).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe work was cleaned of a previous natural-resin varnish and coated with its current synthetic varnish during the 1972 treatment (see Conservation History). It is unknown whether the removed natural-resin varnish was original to the painting.\n\nThe painting\u2019s first documented treatment occurred in 1968, when it was recorded as having an aqueous lining with a hardboard interleaf and a secondary canvas backing. At this time the painting also had widespread cracking and abrasion; abraded areas were overpainted, and the entire painting was coated in a heavy, discolored natural-resin varnish (fig. 16.37). During this treatment, grime was removed and the surface coating was thinned. The work was inpainted with methacrylate paints and given a synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, inpainting, and a final coat of L-46). In 1972 the painting was treated again, and all varnish coatings were removed. The work was inpainted and varnished using the same materials as in the 1968 treatment.\n\nThe painting is in good condition, with a secure aqueous lining and hardboard interleaf; deformation of the board over time has caused the painting to have a slight overall concave warp. The lining process accentuated nubs, uneven thread thicknesses, and other canvas imperfections, in addition to increasing the weave impression, especially in the horizontal direction. There also appear to be localized lumps of lining adhesive throughout. The pressure of the lining process caused stress microcracking along the threads, visible under microscopic examination. There are stretcher-bar creases across the center with associated cracking, and there is localized cracking in the figure\u2019s face and costume. The painting has a glossy synthetic varnish that was applied during the 1972 treatment, with residues of a very discolored natural-resin or oil-resin varnish in the depressions of the canvas weave. The effect of this discoloration is especially noticeable in the background, where large areas appear to have a yellow cast. This darkening, combined with underpainting in the background immediately surrounding the figure, gives a false sense of space because the side margins appear more lightly painted than the center. The inpainting is limited to localized losses and abrasions.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nThe current frame may be original to the painting. It is a French (Paris), late-nineteenth-century, Louis XIV reproduction, gilt ogee frame with cast foliate ornament, center and corner fleur-de-lis cartouches linked by foliate scrolls and strapwork, and pendent bellflowers on a diamond bed. The frame has oil and water gilding over red bole on cast plaster and gesso. The ornament and sight molding are selectively burnished, and the gilding has been heavily rubbed, exposing the bole. The gilding is toned with a casein or gouache raw umber wash with a gray overwash. The pine molding is mitered and nailed.

Barbara Ehrlich White, in Renoir: His Life, Art, and Letters (Abrams, 1988), p. 129, dated this letter to early 1883. Renoir\u2019s remark suggests that the Berards were returning to Paris, presumably from Wargemont.

Bailey has further asserted that it is very unlikely Renoir would have embarked on this portrait while he was preoccupied with the full-length dance panels Dance in the City and Dance in the Country (both 1883; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [Daulte 440 and 441; Dauberville 1000 and 999]) and Dance at Bougival (1883; Museum of Fine Arts, Boston [Daulte 438; Dauberville 1001]); Colin B.

Colin B. Bailey and Christopher Riopelle, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London, 2007), p. 279. It should be cautioned, however, that this speculation about the occasion of the portrait is the only evidence that Renoir visited Wargemont in 1883.

Without documentation of the works borrowed for the exhibition, however, there can be no certainty about whom the work represented. And it seems unlikely that Renoir would have identified Margot in her portrait but not Lucie in the same exhibition. Daulte and Dauberville refer to the Renoir catalogues raisonn\u00e9s: Fran\u00e7ois Daulte, Auguste Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 de l\u2019oeuvre peint (Durand-Ruel, 1971); Guy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Renoir: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9 des tableaux, pastels, dessins et aquarelles, vols. 1\u20135 (Bernheim-Jeune, 2007\u201314).\n\nHis full-length portrait of actress Jeanne Samary (1877; Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow [Daulte 229; Dauberville 462]) was exhibited at Portraits du si\u00e8cle, \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, Apr. 1883, as no. 312.

Henner, an Alsatian strongly influenced by prevailing tastes for Diego Rodr\u00edguez de Silva y Vel\u00e1zquez and the Italian Renaissance, attended the salon of Marguerite Charpentier (where he met Renoir) and apparently had more success obtaining portrait commissions than did Renoir.

But Colin Bailey asserts that, because Lucie was so young and the Berards of such social standing, Renoir is more likely to have begun the work in the Berards\u2019 home on the rue Pigalle. Colin B. Bailey to Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 24, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me any more about portraits in the sunlight. Nice black backgrounds, that\u2019s the real thing.\u201d Renoir to Paul Berard, undated; translated in Barbara Ehrlich White, Renoir: His Life, Art, and Letters (Abrams, 1988), pp. 126\u201327. White assigned the letter to the autumn of 1882, following the artist\u2019s decision to make a second version of the portrait of Madame Clapisson.\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai fait les frais d\u2019un beau cadre pour le portrait de Lucie, je l\u2019ai accroch\u00e9 en bonne place dans mon cabinet et Marguerite et moi nous p\u00e2mons de contentement devant lui.\u201d Berard to Charles Deudon, Dec. 12, 1883, from Paris, in Anne Distel, \u201cCharles Deudon (1832\u20131914) collectionneur,\u201d Revue de l\u2019art 86 (1989), p. 62; author\u2019s translation. The current frame, a Louis XIV reproduction dating to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century, may be the one that Berard had made for the painting (see Frame in the technical report).\n\nIn many cases, the absence of ground on the tacking margins and uneven ground application are taken to indicate an artist-applied ground. Recent research has also suggested, however, that smaller-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single canvases. In this painting, the composition of the ground\u2014nearly pure lead white with almost no extenders\u2014suggests that the canvas was prepared by the artist. The trace elements found in the ground are so small in quantity that they are interpreted to be impurities in the lead white tube paint rather than extenders commonly found in greater proportion in lead-based priming material used in traditional commercial preparation. The standard size stamp on the stretcher may indicate that it was purchased separately or reused for this painting. See Anthea Callen, The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 68.

The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination, in conjunction with XRF, suggests that the signature is predominantly cobalt blue.

Cross-sectional analysis did not reveal a discrete sizing layer; however, sizing was common practice in preparing a canvas. While this canvas was not commercially primed, it is unclear whether unprimed canvas sold to an artist or color merchant would have had a commercially applied sizing. A thinly applied sizing, whether applied by the artist or by the color merchant, could have been absorbed by the canvas and would not be visible under current circumstances. See Inge Fiedler and Marc Vermeulen, \u201c1933\\_1172\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Dec. 30, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nOften the absence of ground on the tacking margins and uneven ground application are taken to indicate an artist-applied ground. Anthea Callen wrote, \u201cRaw fabric on the edges of a canvas support show that the ground was applied after the canvas had been stretched. This is the norm for self-priming\u2014artists generally stretched the canvas and then primed only the surface to be painted.\u201d Recent research has also suggested that small-scale color merchants may have stretched and prepared single supports from rolls of unprimed canvas (see cat. 15, Chrysanthemums). In this painting, the composition of the ground\u2014nearly pure lead white with almost no extenders\u2014suggests that the canvas was prepared by the artist.

The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nThe identification of charcoal or black chalk is estimated, based on stereomicroscopic and infrared examinations; it has not been analytically confirmed.\n\nThis effect is exaggerated by discolored varnish trapped in the depressions of the paint (see Condition Summary).\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, vermilion (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); zinc yellow (XRF, PLM 2012, SEM/EDX); two red lakes (PLM, SEM/EDX); iron-oxide red and/or yellow (XRF, PLM 2012); bone black (XRF); burnt sienna (PLM 2012); ultramarine blue (electron microprobe, PLM 2012). Electron microprobe and PLM results from 1972 were published in Marigene H. Butler, \u201cTechnical Note,\u201d in Paintings by Renoir (Art Institute of Chicago, 1973), p. 211.

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nInitially identified as Naples yellow in 1972, the predominant yellow has been confirmed to be zinc yellow; there may be trace amounts of Naples yellow present.

The fluorescing red lake appears to have an aluminum substrate, while the nonfluorescing red lake may have a tin (with possibly some calcium and a trace of phosphrus) substrate. Identifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207. Lake substrates were identified by SEM/EDX.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.

There is some evidence that Renoir experimented with matte surfaces between 1883 and 1889, following his trip to Italy.
