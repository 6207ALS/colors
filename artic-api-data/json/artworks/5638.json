They were childless, and although Hadrian granted Sabina many of the honors usually accorded to an empress, he did not mint coins with her portrait until much later in his reign, around 128.</p>\n<p>The front (obverse) of this coin portrays the bust of Sabina, draped, wearing a diadem; her hair is waved up in a crest. The back (reverse) depicts the goddess Juno standing to the left, veiled, with a patera in her right hand extended over a peacock, her left hand rests on a scepter.</p>\n",
