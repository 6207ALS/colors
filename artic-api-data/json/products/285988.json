    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Print developed from Eugene Edgerton\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Milk Drop Coronet,</em>&nbsp;1957, from the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Dr. Harold Edgerton often claimed his photographic work was only an incidental result of scientific experimentation.&nbsp; Edgerton began trying to photograph drops of milk in 1932, and in 1936 produced an image almost identical to the one here, but in black and white, of two milk drops colliding in a crown-like splash. He continued to experiment with this subject for two decades until he finally achieved visual clarity in vivid color, which can be seen in <em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Milk Drop Coronet</em>, 1957.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image size:</strong> 11 x 15 in.</li><li><strong>Poster size:</strong> 12 x 16 in.</li><li><strong>Materials:</strong> Premium Cardstock</li></ul>",
