The people of the Six Nations refer to themselves as \u201cpeople of the longhouse,\u201d taking their identity from the traditional building that served as a communal dwelling and ceremonial hall, and which characterized the permanent villages in which the Iroquois lived.\n\nThis confederacy, perhaps the oldest democracy on earth, existed long before the Europeans arrived and took notice of it. It was based on two legislative bodies, or \u201cbrotherhoods,\u201d the elder comprised of Mohawks and Seneca, the younger of Oneidas, Cayugas and Tuscaroras. If these two \u201chouses\u201d were unable to agree on a matter, the Onondagas would cast the deciding vote. The Iroquois equivalent of the Supreme Court was the Women\u2019s Council, which settled disputes and adjudicated legal matters. Implicit in Iroquois political philosophy is a commitment to the highest principles of human liberty, including freedom of speech and the right of women to participate in government.\n\nUnderlying all deliberations was a spiritual figure, the Peacemaker, who gave the Tree of Peace as a symbol of the Great Law of Peace. Beneath the tree, the Nations buried their hatchets, and atop it sat the Eagle-who-sees-far.\n\nIroquois law strongly influenced Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and other framers of the US Constitution. The theory that the Constitution is based on the Iroquois Great Law of Peace rather than Greek democracy is gaining credence. Certainly Jefferson adopted Iroquois symbols: the Tree of Peace became the Tree of Liberty, and the Eagle-who-sees-far became the symbol of the new American government (clutching thirteen arrows).\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
