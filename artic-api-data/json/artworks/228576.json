    "description": "<p><em>Jinbaori</em> were special coats worn by samurai, members of the Japanese warrior class. The garments were sleeveless and had a tall rear vent\u2014to accommodate being layered over armor, while the wearer was on horseback. The potent graphics and high-contrast colors were meant to convey a message of strength from a distance. This striking example sends a powerful visual message in its depiction of breaking waves and flying spray, dramatically presented in silhouette in black and yellow, as well as in its use of bear fur lining the armholes. On the back of the coat is the circular crest of the Honda family, an important warrior clan loyal to the ruling Tokugawa family (ruled 1615-1868).</p>\n",
