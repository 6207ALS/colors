    "description": "<p>In support of Gauguin: Artist as Alchemist, curator Gloria Groom and conservator Harriet Stratis discuss the artist\u2019s career-spanning experiments in different media and formats\u2014clay, works on paper, wood, and paint, as well as furniture and decorative friezes\u2014 presenting him as a consummate craftsman whose transmutations of the ordinary yielded new and remarkable forms.</p><p>Paul Gauguin (1848\u20131903) was a creative force above and beyond his legendary work as a painter. Throughout his career he experimented in different media and formats, and this enduring interest in craft and applied arts significantly affected his creative process. </p><p>By embracing other art forms, which offered fewer dominant models to guide his work, Gauguin freed himself from the burden of artistic precedent. In turn, these groundbreaking creative forays, especially in ceramics, gave new direction to his paintings. This emphasis on craftsmanship deepens our understanding of Gauguin\u2019s considerable achievements as a painter, draftsman, sculptor, ceramicist, and printmaker within the history of modern art.</p><p> </p><p>Made possible by the Mickie Silverstein Endowed Fund</p>",
