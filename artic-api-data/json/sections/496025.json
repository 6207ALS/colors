On his mother\u2019s side, he was descended from C. Servilius Ahala, who had stopped Spurius Maelius from claiming a royal crown and overthrowing the young Republic in 439 B.C. On his father\u2019s side, he was a scion of L. Junius Brutus, who was made the first consul of the new Republic after overthrowing the kings in 509 B.C. This coin, minted when M. Brutus was moneyer of Rome, depicts his most illustrious ancestor as consul, walking between two lictors and preceded by an aide (accensus). His ancestor\u2019s name (and his own) is proclaimed below. The theme of freedom from tyranny is reinforced on the obverse, with the serene head of Liberty personified. This coin, minted ten years before Brutus would lead other senators in the assassination of Julius Caesar, seems to us to warn Caesar not to get too close to this noble-minded defender of liberty.\n\nThe reality is more complex. In fact, both Ahala and L. Junius Brutus are rather problematic as legendary tyrannicides. Ahala\u2019s stabbing of Maelius was at the time prosecuted as murder, and L. Junius Brutus didn\u2019t actually kill either the abuser T. Sextus or his father, King Tarquin. In addition, at the time this coin was minted by Brutus, his mother, Servilia, had become the lover of Julius Caesar, who consistently aided and encouraged the young man\u2019s political career. Despite Caesar\u2019s favor, Brutus eventually found himself siding with the conservative optimates led by Pompey against Caesar\u2019s party, the populares. Brutus\u2019s defense of the Senate\u2019s rights meant that he and Pompey the Great would ultimately fight together against Caesar in the civil war. However, despite our romantic desire to see this coin as a presage of the Ides of March, the proclamation of liberty and republican ideals on this coin is more likely directed against Pompey the Great, an aristocrat with ambitions every bit on the scale of Caesar\u2019s and who had caused the death of Brutus\u2019s father when Brutus was still a child.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">To be precise, coconsul, along with L. Tarquinius Collatinus. Collatinus was the husband of that Lucretia who had been raped by Sextus, the son of the king Tarquin the Proud\u2014an abuse of power that sparked the overthrow of the monarchy and the creation of the Republic, according to Roman tradition. The two consuls, elected annually, were the highest executive officers of Republican Rome.\n\nAccording to Livy, Sextus was killed by the inhabitants of Gabii whom he had betrayed earlier and King Tarquin died as a result of wounds received as he fought with the Latins against the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus: see cat. 25, Didrachm (Coin) Depicting the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux).\n\nRumors of a dictatorship for Pompey were circulating at the time; he was in fact appointed (or elected) \u201csole consul\u201d (dictator in all but name) in 52 B.C.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 28 Denarius (Coin) Depicting Liberty, 54 B.C.\n\n</section>",
