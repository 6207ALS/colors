    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Ralph Elmer Clarkson's portrait of Nouvart Dzeron, was something of a departure for the Chicago artist. He was known for painting dignitaries, including a mayor, governor, college president, Nobel laureate, and secretary of war. Clarkson also took on many private commissions for wealthy patrons.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  However, this subject fell into none of those categories. When he completed this painting, Clarkson was a well-established mentor and an influential teacher at the Art Institute of Chicago. Nouvart Dzeron was a brilliant student there, and part of a proud Armenian family. Here she strikes a dramatic pose, wearing a costume sent to her by her grandfather from the village where she was born. The dramatic effect is heightened by the strong contrast of her silhouette with the background, and by brushwork that seems only half finished in places. Clarkson may have been inspired by the vogue from Middle-Eastern subjects at this time. This young woman, in her loose trousers and long braids, would have seemed exotic to many viewers.</p>\n",
