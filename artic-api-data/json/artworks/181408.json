    "description": "<p>On February 20, 1885, Whistler delivered the \u201cTen O\u2019Clock,\u201d an hour-long public lecture on art, to an audience composed of fashionable Londoners including artists, dealers, and members of the press. He chose the unconventional time\u2014two hours later than most evening events\u2014to ensure a crowd, and he enlisted the services of the theatrical producer Richard D\u2019Oyly Carte and Carte\u2019s manager, Helen Lenoir, to secure the venue in Piccadilly, promote the event, and sell tickets. The lecture was well received by the audience and was mostly well reviewed in the press the next day.<br>This professionally engraved invitation\u2014with touches of hand coloring on the butterfly emblem\u2014is actually more of an announcement, given that \u201cinvitees\u201d paid to attend the lecture.</p>\n",
