The history of this image is probably identical to that of Mother and Child, No. 3 (cat. 52) and Mother and Child, No. 4 (cat. 54); all three images were drawn on thin, transparent French papier v\u00e9getal apparently supplied by the French printer Belfond, with whom Whistler collaborated on color lithographs. T. R. Way (1896, 1905) erroneously recorded that the drawings had been made in 1890 and set aside until they were transferred by the Way firm in 1895 (with the exception of this image, which he noted was transferred in 1896). In fact, it seems likely that the Ways had no idea when Whistler originally created the drawings\u2014which seem to have been linked to his plans to work in color with a Parisian printer\u2014and that they were all transferred and printed in 1895, when Whistler consigned the group to the Ways.\n\nThere is certainly reason to question T. R. Way\u2019s information that Mother and Child, No. 2 was not printed until 1896. Whistler made a preliminary list of lithographs to be framed for the Fine Art Society exhibition on the back of a letter that Way sent to him in Lyme Regis on 25 November 1895 (app. I.1). These notes also included lists of lithographs not to be framed and those to be excluded from the exhibition, as well as a cryptic series of titles that the artist thought might be wanted. One of these subjects, identified as \u201cThe Other Mother and Child,\u201d was presumably this lithograph. By January 1896, when a second edition of the Fine Art Society catalogue was issued, Mother and Child, No. 2 was listed as no. 75. It was one of five images added to the exhibition to supplement the original seventy (app. V.1).\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper ( 227 \u00d7 283 mm); MWC, cream laid paper (212 \u00d7 330 mm), signed.
