It was one of three transfer drawings (cat. 127, cat 128, and cat. 129) processed and printed by the Ways on 8 October 1895 (app. II.4). Whistler received the first proofs two days later. He was not pleased with their uneven appearance and selected this image as a candidate for reworking by means of a second transfer drawing, along with three other blacksmith subjects drawn in Lyme Regis (cat. 121, cat. 123, and cat. 128). There are several surviving proofs of both the second and third states bearing registration marks that the Ways added to the stone at the artist\u2019s request (letter 146). Two impressions of the second state (now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow, and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) have graphite additions that were probably preliminary explorations of revisions that Whistler contemplated for the second transfer drawing. However, the idea for developing the four smithy subjects using additional transfers was never carried any further.\n\nInstead, Whistler made revisions to this image and to The Brothers (cat. 128) directly on the original stones when he returned to London, either in late December 1895 or early January 1896. Although The Blacksmith was not included in the catalogue of the Fine Art Society exhibition that opened in mid-December, an impression may have been added to the show before it closed. One impression of the image was sold to A. H. Studd either during the exhibition or shortly thereafter, according to a list of sales sent to Whistler in March 1896 (app. III.4).\n\nT. R. Way described the first state (Way 90a) of this lithograph as follows (1896, 1905): \u201cThe effect . . . is very gray and soft, the shadows almost all confined to the square opening behind the figure, and principally obtained by stump work over the chalk drawing. The smith\u2019s face, too, is quite clean!\u201d\n\nChicago: AIC, cream wove proofing paper (255 \u00d7 193 mm), inscribed, in T. R. Way\u2019s hand, 1st state.\n\nIn this state the smith\u2019s facial features have been elaborated slightly and the shadow strengthened around his head. The overall effect is no longer gray, but one in which darks and lights are more clearly contrasted. \u00d7-shaped registration marks have been added in the four corners of the composition, although often all marks are not visible in a given impression. Way (1905) indicated that only four impressions of the second state were printed, but many more have been identified.\n\nChicago: MWC (2), cream laid paper (332 \u00d7 214 mm), signed, with \u00d7-shaped registration marks at upper right, lower left, and (barely discernible) lower right corners of the image; buff wove proofing paper (255 \u00d7 192 mm), signed and inscribed, in Howard Mansfield\u2019s hand, 2nd state. Glasgow: HAG (3), ivory wove proofing paper (290 \u00d7 198 mm), with \u00d7-shaped registration marks at all four corners of the image, and with graphite additions in face; cream laid paper (246 \u00d7 182 mm); ivory wove proofing paper (293 \u00d7 254 mm), with +-shaped registration marks centered on all four sides of the image. Washington: LC, cream laid paper (287 \u00d7 227 mm), signed; NGA, ivory laid paper (290 \u00d7 203 mm), signed, with graphite additions in apron, jars, left background, proper left arm, right elbow.\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Cincinnati, CMA; Cleveland, CMA; and New York, MMA.\n\nExtensive additions have been made directly on the stone. The features of the blacksmith\u2019s face have been more sharply defined, as have his garments and right arm. The recess behind him has been darkened and the jars more clearly delineated. Hatched lines have been added to the windowpanes at upper left as well as to the areas above and to the immediate left of the recess; the new lines partially obscure some of the hanging implements. There is also additional hatching to the left of the tub, in the wheel, and adjacent to both sides of the sledgehammer in the foreground. The circumference of the wheel has been modified with an additional curved line. Light crayon lines at the right of the forge have further articulated the original stumping to give the appearance of rising smoke or flames. Registration marks have been retained, although they are not consistently legible. There is a pronounced difference in surface texture between the additions made directly on the fine-grained stone and the original work drawn on transfer paper placed over a textured support.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (282 \u00d7 228 mm), signed, with partial \u00d7-shaped registration marks at all four corners of the image. Glasgow: HAG (2), cream laid paper (279 \u00d7 199 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (287 \u00d7 220 mm), signed. London: BM, cream wove Japanese vellum (299 \u00d7 218 mm). Washington: FGA (2), cream laid paper (281 \u00d7 195 mm), signed, with partial \u00d7-shaped registration marks at all four corners of the image; cream laid paper (248 \u00d7 183 mm), signed; NGA, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 228 mm), signed, with partial \u00d7-shaped registration marks at all four corners of the image.\n\nRemarks: Another third-state impression is found in New York, MMA.  \nNesta R.
