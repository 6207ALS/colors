    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This unusual chair is by the Italian designer, Carlo Bugatti.  Curator Ghenete Zelleke.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE:  It's called the Cobra Chair because of the way that the spine of the back and the roundel at the top of the chair appear to be like the head of a cobra about to spring forward.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The chair is covered with parchment, delicately painted with insects and floral motifs.  A disk of beaten copper decorates its back.  In fact, the chair is more a sculptural object than a functional piece of furniture.  Bugatti designed it in 1902 as part of an extraordinary circular interior for an international exhibition in Turin, Italy.  Bugatti's room was circular and featured parchment covered banquettes that appeared to grow out of the walls.</p>\n<p>GHENETE ZELLEKE: And in the center of the room were four chairs of which this was one, standing around a table surface which seemed to emerge out of the shell of a snail, so there was an extraordinary organic and very sensuous atmosphere to this room.</p>\n",
