    "description": "<p>Monet loved to paint what he saw around him, particularly the Seine River. He was initially rejected for using bright colors, tangled brushstrokes\u2013condemned for his impressions. But soon art dealers and collectors were lining up each morning to see as Monet saw. Monet, however, waited only for the light, the changing light. Each morning he had a dozen canvases on hand to paint a dozen different moments.&nbsp;His brush moved back and forth, chasing sunlight\u2013putting in the arduous work to create an image that seemed to contain no effort at all.</p><ul><li><strong>Hardcover</strong></li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8.5 x 11 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 40</li><li><strong>4-8 years</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",
