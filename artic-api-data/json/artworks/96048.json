Priestly instruments, a  praefericulum (tall vase with handle) and lituus (staff), appear to left and right. On the back (reverse), Anapius and Amphinomus carry their parents; between them, Neptune stands with his foot on a ship prow.</p>\n<p>Coins were an efficient form of publicity, particularly when new rulers needed to legitimize their succession or strengthen their reputation. After Pompey\u2019s defeat by Julius Caesar, his sons tried to revitalize their father\u2019s reputation and thereby enhance their own stature by issuing coins with Pompey\u2019s portrait, such as this one.</p>\n",
