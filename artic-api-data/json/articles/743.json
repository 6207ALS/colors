    "title": "Seeing Triple: The Great Wave by Hokusai",
    "copy": " In 1830 at the age of 70, Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai began a series of woodblock prints. At the time, the Tokugawa government's increasing political and moral censorship led artists to focus their work on landscapes, rather than figures, and Hokusai chose to celebrate the ancient pilgrimage site of Mount Fuji in 36 separate prints. Of all the mountain views, one in particular would become one of the world's most famous images. Titled Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura) , it is known as simply The Great Wave. With its bold linear design, striking juxtapositions, and simple use of color, The Great Wave is one of the most compelling images of Japan's tallest peak (and still-active volcano). The surging breakers, possessing a nearly demonic energy, seem to swamp the boaters and, to the Japanese eye, accustomed to reading from right to left, the great claw of a wave appears almost to tumble in the viewer's face. Even Mount Fuji appears fragile, about to be engulfed.   \u201cPeople always ask, \u2018Where\u2019s The Great Wave ? Why isn\u2019t it out?\u2019 Unfortunately, we can\u2019t have it out permanently,\u201d says Janice Katz, Roger L. Weston Associate Curator of Japanese Art. The reason is simple: Japanese woodblock prints are particularly affected by prolonged exposure to lighting that can fade their colors and damage the paper they\u2019re printed on. \u201cWe only show a print for three months, every five years,\u201d Katz explains. \u201cIt\u2019s always a balancing act between wanting to show as much of the collection as possible and preserving it for the future.\u201d   The Art Institute has three impressions of Hokusai\u2019s famous work, which are all later impressions than the first state of the design. \u201cI love putting them out at the same time,\u201d says Katz, \u201cbecause people don\u2019t always realize that it\u2019s a print. It\u2019s something that was commercially produced for the mass market. It\u2019s not a painting; it\u2019s not a singular work. There are many the world over, and there are many different editions of it.\u201d The version acquired by the museum in 1952 appears dramatically different from the others. \u201cIt has a pink sky,\u201d Katz notes. \u201cThe pink sky was in the original! It\u2019s just faded in so many copies that we don\u2019t think of The Great Wave as having a pink sky.\u201d That\u2019s as good an argument as any for why these works must be properly stored and selectively displayed. With proper care and patience, that sky will stay pink for centuries to come. Catch all three waves April 6 through June 22 in the exhibition Connoisseurship of Japanese Prints. They won't be out for another five years! ",
