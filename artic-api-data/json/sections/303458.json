His letters to the Ways in October and November 1893 are full of enthusiasm for the work he planned to do both on transfer paper and directly on the stone. By mid-November he sent five new transfer drawings to the Ways via the publisher Andr\u00e9 Marty, who was leaving Paris for London to arrange for prints to be included in forthcoming L\u2019Estampe originale albums (letter 55).\n\nAll of the drawings that Marty delivered to the Ways incorporated the use of the stump; two were figure studies (cat. 72 and cat. 73) and three were views of the Luxembourg Gardens in Paris (cat. 68, cat. 69, and cat. 70). The largest was The Steps, Luxembourg, a lively image of figures on one of the grand flights of stairs connecting the terrace to the sunken garden at the center of the park, which was laid out in 1613. The Luxembourg was close to Whistler\u2019s studio on the rue Notre Dame des Champs, and its steps, terraces, balustrades, and decorative sculpture appear in numerous drawings, etchings, and lithographs of this period.\n\nIn creating this drawing Whistler used the stump for passages in the steps, tree trunks, sculptural planter, foliage, and sky. When the first proofs were pulled in November 1893, the Ways feared that the stumping in the sky had turned out \u201ctoo dark, or too heavy\u201d (letter 57). However, when Whistler received the proofs he was delighted with them and hoped that the skies would \u201cstay in the printing throughout exactly as they are\u201d (letter 58). He briefly considered The Steps, Luxembourg for inclusion in L\u2019Estampe originale, but subsequently selected The Draped Figure, Seated (cat. 72).\n\nIn addition to the two trial proofs\u2014one on \u201cordinary printing paper\u201d and one on \u201cDutch\u201d\u2014that the Ways were initially instructed to print (letter 53), Whistler subsequently ordered and received at least twenty-four impressions of The Steps, Luxembourg. Therefore, a conservative estimate of lifetime impressions of this subject would be twenty-six, rather than the fifteen listed by Way in his 1905 catalogue.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid paper (367 \u00d7 242 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (368 \u00d7 247 mm), signed.
