    "description": "<p>Small-scale Egyptian figurines, known as amulets, were thought to promote health and good luck. Amulets were such an important part of Egyptian religious beliefs that they were worn by both the living and the dead. They could be mounted on rings or strung as bracelets or necklaces and were often placed among a mummy's wrappings to secure the deceased\u2019s rebirth and well-being in the afterlife. Many varieties of amulets survived, including figures of deities, parts of the human (or divine) body, animals, plants, and objects of daily life. Nehebkau, often depicted as a male with a snakehead, was one of the deities who judged the deceased before a council of the gods.</p>\n",
