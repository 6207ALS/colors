The project\u2019s impetus and funding came from the Getty Foundation. The initial coding and technical implementation was researched and executed by the IMA Lab, a web design and development consultancy of the Indianapolis Museum of Art.\n\nWe recommend using the latest version of Chrome, Safari, or Firefox.\n\nThe following is a guide on how to cite the texts in this catalogue.\n\nDescriptive Analysis and Related Works  \nPeter Zegers, \u201cGauguin\\_Cat. 25 Eve, Portrait of the Artist\u2019s Mother--2002.224: Descriptive Analysis,\u201d in Gauguin Paintings, Sculpture, and Graphic Works at the Art Institute of Chicago, ed.
