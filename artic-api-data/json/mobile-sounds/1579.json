    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The French sculptor Jean-Joseph Carri\u00e8s made this unusual piece called the \u201cLe Grenouillard\u201d, or \u201cThe Frogman\u201d, in 1892. It was included in his exhibition in Paris that year, which caused a sensation among avant-garde artists and critics. Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution had become popularized in the late 19th century and artists like Carri\u00e8s created figures that seemed to reach across from the animal world to the human world. \u201cThe Frogman\u201d is a rather grotesque figure who resembles the frogs that he is clutching or seated on his back and around his feet. He has a long spine, bulging eyes and even webbed frog-like feet. Carri\u00e8s, like many of his contemporaries, was also very interested in Japanese art which enjoyed a great vogue in France, beginning in the 1860s. This piece is reminiscent of Japanese netsuke or small, decorative carvings often prized for the wit and humor of their subject matter. Carri\u00e8s sculpture is made of plaster, but its polished, colored surface calls to mind the deep shine of bronzes and Japanese lacquers.</p>\n",
