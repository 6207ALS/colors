I.1, I.2, II.4, III.2, III.3, III.4, V.1  \nSelected Literature: Wedmore 1896, p. 12; Way (1912), p. 87; Way (1913), p. 282; Pennell (1914), p. 732; Pennell and Pennell (1921), p. 251 (as The Long Bridge)  \nLifetime Exhibitions: Paris 1891 (no. 965); New York 1894; London 1895\u201396 (no. 41); New York 1898 (no. 298); London 1898\u201399 (no. 1994); Chicago 1900a (no. 132); Chicago 1900b (no. 10, as Battersea Bridge); New York 1901 (no. 128)\n\nWhistler drew this view of Old Battersea Bridge (see also cat. 11, cat. 12, and cat. 13) directly on the stone, apparently as he sat in a boat on the Thames at high tide. Several pedestrians on the bridge have paused to look down at the artist at work. In the distance, framed by two of the great wooden bridge piers, are the tower of Chelsea Church and the neighboring houses along Cheyne Walk.\n\nAfter Thomas Way pulled a few trial proofs of the lithograph, Whistler altered both the image and his butterfly monogram. As in the case of Reading (cat. 17), the changes may have been made in 1879, immediately after the artist saw the proofs, or in 1887, when the stone was being readied for publication in the Notes portfolio (see also cat. 7, cat. 8, cat. 14, cat. 15, and cat. 17).\n\nAlthough in his catalogue T. R. Way recorded only the one hundred impressions of this lithograph that were pulled for Notes, on 16 February 1896 (letter 165) he stated that \u201ca good many more than the 100 proofs\u201d had already been pulled to satisfy orders from Whistler and from the Fine Art Society, and warned that the twenty proofs just ordered by the FAS \u201chad better be the last lot.\u201d\n\nOld Battersea Bridge was one of two images selected by T. R. Way for printing during a demonstration and lecture on lithography he presented to the Art Workers\u2019 Guild in May 1893 (see also cat. 34). According to the Pennells\u2019 account (1921) of that evening, Way printed two stones without Whistler\u2019s knowledge and distributed the prints he pulled to the members of the group.\n\nTrials were pulled before changes to the butterfly monogram, and before the removal of bridge suspension cables at far left; in this state the cables extend beyond the left edge of the distant bridge.\n\nChicago: AIC, white plate paper (262 \u00d7 396 mm).\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in Washington, private collection.\n\nWhistler\u2019s butterfly monogram has been made tidier and more regular, and two veins in the wings have been removed. A horizontal line at the far right of the image in the bridge superstructure has been removed and the suspension cables at far left have been erased, slightly reducing the image size.\n\nChicago: AIC, tan laid paper (309 \u00d7 450 mm). Glasgow: HAG (5), cream laid paper (285 \u00d7 458 mm), signed; cream laid paper (248 \u00d7 386 mm), signed; cream laid paper (204 \u00d7 334 mm); tan laid paper (310 \u00d7 479 mm); cream laid paper (456 \u00d7 285 mm), signed.

One hundred impressions of Old Battersea Bridge were issued in Notes portfolios. Notes impressions were printed on cream Japanese paper (large sets) or grayish ivory proofing paper (small sets), mounted on white plate paper, which has often discolored to off-white or ivory.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream chine (Japanese paper, 208 \u00d7 346 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (347 \u00d7 483 mm), signed; MWC, cream chine (Japanese paper, 208 \u00d7 344 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (380 \u00d7 503 mm), signed; Palmer, grayish ivory chine (207 \u00d7 345 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (334 \u00d7 480 mm). Glasgow: HAG, cream chine (Japanese paper, 205 \u00d7 342 mm) mounted on ivory plate paper (380 \u00d7 542 mm), in a Notes set of 6.

Impressions in Notes sets of 5 are found in Boston, BPL; and New York, MMA. Additional impressions are found in Boston, MFA; Cincinnati, CAM; Cleveland, CMA; and San Francisco, AFGA (2).  \nNesta R.
