    "description": "<p>An avid nature photographer, Eliot Porter helped to  pioneer technologies of color printing. He is best known for vibrant three-color dye imbibition prints of nature scenes and cultural landmarks, published in books and portfolios in partnership with the Sierra Club. Hugh Edwards featured Porter\u2019s work in a 1963 exhibition that seems to have cemented his impressions of color photography, which was at this point largely reserved for commercial purposes. \u201cAt last I can feel certain,\u201d the curator wrote to Porter, \u201cthat great photographs can be made in color\u2014something I was skeptical about for so long.\u201d The following year, the museum acquired 21 prints.</p>\n",
