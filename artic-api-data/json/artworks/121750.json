    "description": "<p>Minor White was a significant figure in 20th-century photography not only as an artist, but also as an editor (he co-founded <em>Aperture</em> magazine), curator (at George Eastman House), and teacher (at the Rochester Institute of Technology, the San Francisco Art Institute, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology). He was greatly influenced by Alfred Stieglitz\u2019s concept of \u201cEquivalents\u201d\u2014in which a photograph not only depicts a subject but also serves as a metaphor for emotions and the photographer\u2019s inner state\u2014as well as Zen philosophy. Interested in \u201cthings for what else they are,\u201d White found compelling pictures in the abstract or banal.</p>\n",
