    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Edward Hopper said he based &quot;Nighthawks&quot; on a diner in New York's Greenwich Village, where he lived for 54 years.  Despite many attempts to find the original building, it's not a literal depiction of any one specific place.  Hopper has radically simplified the setting to heighten the overwhelming mood of loneliness and isolation.  The street outside is totally deserted, with not even a trace of litter to suggest that anyone has ever passed by, and no door to the diner is visible.  It's as if the four people inside are trapped inside a fishbowl.  Two patrons stare straight ahead.  Through apparently together, they seem to have nothing to share with each other, or with the hunched-over third patron.  Hopper was an avid moviegoer, and &quot;Nighthawks&quot; has the feel of a scene from a 1940s film noir.  Such films took their subject matter and alienated characters from crime stories by writers like Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain.  In many of these stories, the action takes place in diners and bars.  Fluorescent lighting was still new in the 1940s, and Hopper has captured the essence of its cool, unflattering glow.  Together, the alienated diners, their lack of interaction, and the greenish tint of the painting convey a sense of loneliness and suggest the difficulty of making connections in the modern urban world.  The Art Institute purchased this painting directly from the artist in 1942 after it had been seen in the museum's annual exhibition of American art that spring.  Now it is one of the most recognized American paintings of all time.</p>\n",
