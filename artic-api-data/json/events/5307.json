    "description": "<p>Join Emerson Bowyer, Searle Curator in Painting and Sculpture of Europe, Catherine Roach, associate professor of&nbsp;art history at Virginia Commonwealth University, and Timothy Barringer, Paul Mellon Professor in the History of Art at Yale University, for a conversation around the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s newest acquisition:&nbsp;<em>The Shadow of Death.</em></p><p>William Holman Hunt\u2019s&nbsp;<em>The Shadow of Death </em>depicts Jesus Christ as a young carpenter in his father\u2019s workshop, stretching and giving thanks to God after his day of labor. It is packed with an array of information, all rendered with almost hallucinatory detail and conveying a rich and complex set of narratives, religious and secular. The painting is among Hunt\u2019s most famous compositions and one of the few iconic Pre-Raphaelite works to have remained in private hands. In pristine condition and housed in its original frame, it\u2019s an incredible addition to the Winterbotham Collection and now one of the most important Pre-Raphaelite paintings in North America.</p><h2>About the Speakers</h2><p><strong>Please note that all event&nbsp;times listed are in central time.</strong><br></p><p>We recommend using a laptop or desktop computer and downloading the latest version of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360042414611-New-Updates-for-Zoom-Client\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Zoom</a>&nbsp;to enjoy this program.
