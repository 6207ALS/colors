    "description": "<p>The Artists\u2019 Colouring Books contain 16 sheets of superior acid-free drawing paper, printed with exceptional designs in very light lines. The printing is done in such a way that, depending on the techniques used, the original outline will be hardly visible after colouring. The first-rate paper has a long life and coloured sheets can be framed and displayed without the risk of rapid deterioration. These Books match the quality of the finest artists\u2019 pads. They are perfectly suited to practice your colouring skills and create beautiful pieces at the same time. In order to get the best results, we recommend you use high-quality colouring materials.<br></p><ul><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 10 x 13.5 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 16</li><li><strong>Materials:&nbsp;</strong>180 gsm acid-free&nbsp; drawing paper</li></ul>",
