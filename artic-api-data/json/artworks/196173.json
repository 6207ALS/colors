    "description": "<p>This highly engineered chair illustrates the working process of Edward Barber and Jay Osgerby, who take pleasure in experimenting with new materials and technological processes to create elegant work that is pared down to its essential elements. Designed for the recently renovated De La Warr Pavilion, a modernist structure in the south of England, the sleek aluminum frame of the chair was inspired by the clean lines of the building, designed in 1935. The holes in the seat and back of the chair, which was intended for outdoor use, are both decorative and functional, preventing rain from collecting in the seat. However, it is the kickback leg that distinguishes the design from those of other four-legged metal dining chairs.</p>\n",
