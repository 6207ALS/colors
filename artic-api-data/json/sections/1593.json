In 1744 Joseph Richardson, Sr., of Philadelphia (see cat. 32) distinguished between \u201c2 Punch Straners\u201d and \u201c2 Straners\u201d recorded among the silver in his firm\u2019s display case. In 1760 he ordered \u201c24 Silver Lemon Strainers\u201d from his agent in London. Philadelphia silversmith Edmund Milne listed \u201corange strainers\u201d amid the silver he had received from England in 1763. The 1762 shop inventory of Samuel Edwards of Boston (see cat. 28) includes four silver \u201cpunch Strainers\u201d with an aggregate weight of sixteen troy ounces, twelve pennyweights (each the equivalent of the present strainer). A two-handled strainer of this type, made as part of a tea service ordered in 1792 from Paul Revere, Jr., was recorded in Revere\u2019s account book as a \u201cSilver punch Strainer.\u201d\n\nThis nomenclature indicates that silver strainers were employed to add citrus juices to punch, presumably in the presence of polite company rather than in the kitchen or pantry. A potent South Asian beverage made from alcoholic spirits, citrus, sugar, and spices, punch first became popular in England during the last quarter of the seventeenth century. In both England and its colonies, men were the primary consumers of punch as refreshment during the day, before or after dinner, or at all-male evening gatherings known as \u201cconversations.\u201d Like most English and American examples of the double-handle form, William Simpkins\u2019s strainer does not exceed twelve inches in width, limiting its use to bowls with relatively small diameters; such strainers could also have been utilized to mix punch in a large covered cup. Boston silversmiths fashioned the majority of surviving American strainers with simple loop handles such as those seen on this one, a style that was superseded about 1760 by double-scroll handles with stylized foliate details (see fig. 23.1).\n\nBorn in Boston, Simpkins probably trained with William Cowell, Sr. (see cat. 16), or Andrew Tyler (see cat. 20), both older cousins, or possibly with John Burt (see cat. 19), as Simpkins subsequently maintained connections with several silversmiths who had apprenticed with Burt. By 1728 Simpkins had established his shop on Ann Street near the city\u2019s drawbridge and over the ensuing half-century produced the full range of hollowware and flatware forms popular during the middle decades of the eighteenth century. His workforce included several apprentices, including his son Thomas Barton Simpkins and probably Daniel Rogers of Ipswich, who married Simpkins\u2019s daughter Elizabeth. Among his prominent clients were the merchant, Harvard College tutor, and judge Nicholas Sever and the merchant and Bowdoin College benefactor Thomas Cutts.\n\nThe owners of the Art Institute\u2019s punch strainer were apparently another Massachusetts merchant, Captain Thomas Poynton (1711\u20131781), and his second wife, Hannah Bray (1718\u20131811) of Salem, who married in 1743. Born in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, England, Poynton became wealthy from transatlantic shipping, and he and his wife had significant landholdings in Essex County. Poynton made his last voyage to England in 1775, just prior to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, and was unable to return to Massachusetts before his death. In her will of January 9, 1801, the childless Hannah Poynton divided her personal property between two namesakes of her husband, her great-nephew, Thomas Poynton Ives (1769\u20131835), and her great-great-nephew, Thomas Poynton Bancroft. The strainer descended to Ives\u2019s great-granddaughter Edith Hope (Goddard) Iselin (1868\u20131970). According to the antiques dealer William M. Jacobs, from whom Mrs. C. Phillip Miller acquired the strainer, it came out of the Goddard-Iselin house in Providence.  \nDavid L.
