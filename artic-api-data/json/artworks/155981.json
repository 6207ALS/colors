    "description": "<p>Short aprons are important to the history of women\u2019s dress in many parts of Africa. Though today such aprons are rarely seen outside of ceremonial settings, they were considered to be appropriate coverings well into the mid-20th century. Like other forms of dress, women\u2019s aprons were made from a variety of materials and in a range of styles that often reflected the social status of the wearer.<br>The widespread importation of glass beads beginning in the late 19th century led to a flowering of beadwork across West and Central Africa including the production of beaded women\u2019s aprons. Such aprons demonstrate a range of abstract styles from rigidly structured to highly unstructured and explore variations in geometry, color, and texture. Different approaches to pattern represent different regional styles as well as possibly differences in age and marital status. This apron from northern Cameroon features a red border and multicolored beads set in vertical pairs in the main design. Larger cylindrical dark blue beads hang at the fringe, with cowrie shells tied alternately to one fringe element and then to two elements. The prevalence of light-colored beads in the central portion of this apron and the overall color diffusion produces a light and playful effect, much like that of an Impressionist painting.</p>\n",
