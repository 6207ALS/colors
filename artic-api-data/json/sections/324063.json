For this lithograph he selected as his subject a simple laundry shop on the place Dauphine, located between the Palais de Justice and the Pont Neuf. The artist positioned himself squarely in front of the blanchisserie, not many steps from the open doorway through which four laundresses are depicted busily working; a fifth woman opens the shuttered windows above. A closely related Parisian etching entitled Blanchisserie (fig. 93a [K 438]) similarly portrays a sunny shop facade and the bustling activity in its dark interior.\n\nEstablishing the effect of chiaroscuro solely with line, Whistler was optimistic that this image would transfer and print successfully. When he wrote to T. R. Way on 7 August 1894, the day after mailing the transfer drawing to London, he noted that \u201cit has no stump and ought to come out perfectly,\u201d and he expressed his enthusiasm for \u201cwhat I fancy is perhaps the best drawing I have done\u201d (letter 101). Almost a year later, he still counted The Laundress among his best work in lithography. In a letter of 31 July 1895, he included the image among several that he wished T. R. Way to submit for inclusion in the British section of the \u201cCentenaire de la lithographie\u201d exhibition due to be held at the Champ de Mars in Paris from August to November of that year (letter 138).\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (312 \u00d7 202 mm), signed; MWC, ivory laid paper (315 \u00d7 202 mm), signed.
