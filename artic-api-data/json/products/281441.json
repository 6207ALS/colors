    "description": "<p>Art in Chicago is a magisterial account of the long history of Chicago art, from the rupture of the Great Fire in 1871 to the present, Manierre Dawson, L&aacute;szl&oacute; Moholy-Nagy, and Ivan Albright to Chris Ware, Anne Wilson, and Theaster Gates. The first single-volume history of art and artists in Chicago, the book&mdash;in recognition of the complexity of the story it tells&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t follow a single continuous trajectory. Rather, it presents an overlapping sequence of interrelated narratives that together tell a full and nuanced, yet wholly accessible history of visual art in the city.</p><p>Hardcover</p><p>Pages:&nbsp; 448 pages with 160 color illustrations</p><p>Size:&nbsp; 9.25 in. x 11 in.&nbsp;</p>",
