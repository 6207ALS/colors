For many of the proofs, colored ink was painted onto the plate and then apparently printed without using a press. The completed version of this soft ground etching was among a set of nine color prints first exhibited in 1899. Roussel also made a painting of the same view of sky, sea, and shore at Bognor Regis, located on the southern coast of England.</p>\n",
