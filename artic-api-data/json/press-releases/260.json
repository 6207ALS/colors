    "copy": " Monday, September 24, 2018   CHICAGO\u2014 Pope.L\u2019s The Escape is an experimental restaging of one of the earliest extant pieces of African American dramatic literature: the 1858 play The Escape; or, A Leap to Freedom by the abolitionist and freed black slave William Wells Brown. Through comedy and critique, Brown\u2019s story charts the push and pull of sex, power, and black agency on a Southern plantation before the Civil War. Pope.L\u2019s rendition deconstructs and reassembles fragments of the original play, agitating and transfiguring the material in the process.   The 60-minute performance, which will run November 15\u201318 and November 29\u2013December 2, engages and occupies Rubloff Auditorium in unprecedented and unexpected ways. Four Chicago-based performers and a musician lead a 35-person audience through different overlooked, behind-the-scenes spaces\u2014their characters flickering between past and present. The script and music, devised in collaboration between the artist and the performers, collapse the boundary between fictionalized and autobiographical speech.   As Pope.L has explained, \u201cBrown\u2019s acid sense of humor and his trickster attitude toward whiteness, American letters, and the idea of the literate black produced a text already experimental, already punk and radical.\u201d Pope.L uses Brown\u2019s play \u201cas a fulcrum and a pivot to ask certain piercing, bothersome questions of the text and of our current moment. For example: is the play racist? Does it mean black folk harm with its jokes and ironies? Can a black author make fun of the master, of his own plight, and that of his own people, and contribute to a positive discourse on race relations? And when citizens are made strangers as a matter of course, where are lines of allegiance and alienation drawn?\u201d   Since the 1970s, Pope.L has played with the juncture of absurdity and human-designed definitions. Known in particular for his decades-long \u201ccrawl\u201d performances, in which he crawls the length of New York City in short spurts, he is currently based in Chicago and a faculty member at the University of Chicago. His presentation of The Escape at the Art Institute marks the first public performance of the work.   Thursdays\u2013Saturday performances will take place at 7:00 PM and Sunday performances will take place at 3:00 PM. Tickets are free and will be released to the public on October 4.   Sponsors Support for Pope.L: The Escape is provided by Nancy Lerner Frej and David Frej. ",
