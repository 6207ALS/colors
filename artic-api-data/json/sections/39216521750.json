The off-white ground consists of a single layer. The appearance in the X-ray of small pinholes located close to the foldover on each side may indicate that the canvas was pinned flat for the execution of the painting. Manet carried out the work in multiple sessions, making small changes and reworking several areas of the figure in the process. It appears that the artist scraped or abraded some of the earlier paint layers as he worked up the composition. Manet applied the paint in smooth, broad brushstrokes throughout the background and in the blue cloak, applying more textural brushwork locally in the face and the oysters. The fact that dark-brown paint from the background of the composition extends onto the top and bottom tacking margins suggests that Manet made small adjustments to the painting\u2019s overall dimensions when he stretched the canvas.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 10.1).\n\nSigned: Manet (lower left corner, in dark-brown paint) (fig. 10.2). The underlying paint was dry when the signature was applied.\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe dimensions do not correspond to a standard size. The support was probably custom ordered or possibly cut from a roll of canvas and stretched in the studio.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 16.4V (1.0) \u00d7 22.5H (0.6) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Manet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nCusping is present on all four sides. The cusping is strongest along the top edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1961\u201362 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); tacks spaced 5\u201311 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Old tack holes spaced approximately 2\u20137 cm apart. More than one set of tack holes may be present. The cusping does not always seem to correspond to the placement of the old tack holes. The X-ray appears to show a series of small holes inside or close to the foldover on each side that could relate to an earlier tacking of the canvas if, for example, the canvas was pinned onto a flat surface for execution and then stretched. The holes, however, are currently covered by the black tape applied to the edges after the 1961\u201362 conservation treatment (see Conservation History); one hole remains visible in the lower right corner (fig. 10.3).\n\nCurrent stretcher: Dates to 1961\u201362 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). ICA redwood spring stretcher with vertical wooden crossbar and horizontal metal crossbar. Depth: 3.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The previous stretcher may have been the original stretcher. It was documented as a six-membered stretcher with a vertical and a horizontal crossbar; not mitred.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nIt was not possible to observe all of the original tacking margins as they are partly covered by black adhesive tape that was applied to the edges after the 1962 lining (see Conservation History). A small section of the tape was removed on each side, in areas where the tacking edges appeared to be widest. In all of these areas, the ground extends to the cut edge of the canvas (fig. 10.4). This suggests that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric. Sweeping strokes visible in the X-ray appear to be related to slight differences in thickness of the ground layer resulting from the application technique (fig. 10.5). It appears that a rigid implement, such as a large spatula, was used to smooth the surface of the ground layer, creating some ridges that are visible on the surface of the painting. The ground appears to consist of a single layer that ranges in thickness from approximately 25 to 125 \u00b5m.\n\nThe ground has a warm, off-white tone (fig. 10.6).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground consists of lead white with trace amounts of calcium-based white, silica, and aluminosilicates.  \nBinder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting was built up using broad, relatively flat brushwork throughout the background and in the dark-blue cloak. The more fluid paint applications used in these areas resulted in a fairly smooth surface with few visible brush marks. Manet used somewhat thicker, more impastoed brushstrokes for areas of the figure, including the face, collar, pants, and shoes, as well as the oysters (fig. 10.7, fig. 10.8). These latter areas, which incorporate both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry brushwork, are the most textural passages of the work (fig. 10.9, fig. 10.10, fig. 10.11).\n\nIn the lower right corner, the dark-brown and light-yellowish-gray tones of the background continue underneath the oysters and the straw to some extent; however, small areas of exposed ground visible through the open brushwork of the oysters suggest either that Manet only very lightly and openly sketched the background in this area, or that he scraped away some of the background paint before painting the oysters (fig. 10.8). Microscopically, areas of the ground appear to have been abraded, exposing the peaks of the canvas, before some of the brushstrokes were applied, which perhaps supports the latter hypothesis (fig. 10.12). Evidence of light abrasion or scraping of earlier paint layers was also observed in other areas of the painting (fig. 10.13).\n\nManet appears to have made several small changes to the figure in the course of painting. He modified the figure\u2019s hat on the left and right sides by bringing brown paint from the background over its edges; the green paint from the hat is visible underneath the background in places through open drying cracks (fig. 10.14). The artist also made changes to the collar. The presence of some distinct, lead-white-rich brushstrokes, particularly over the proper right shoulder, suggests that the clothing inside the dark-blue cloak was laid in differently. It also appears that the lower lip may have been laid in more broadly, and then covered by facial hair (fig. 10.15). The X-ray also shows that there was originally a broad fold cutting horizontally across the mid-torso of the figure, suggesting that the blue cloak may have been draped differently at an earlier stage in the painting (fig. 10.16). The appearance of the proper right pant leg in the X-ray indicates that Manet made some small changes to the garment, particularly the deep fold across the shin. The fact that this light-beige area was executed in a single wet-on-wet painting session and that it overlaps the lower edge of the blue cloak indicates that the leg was reworked (fig. 10.17, fig. 10.18). The artist also adjusted the outer edge of the proper right foot (fig. 10.19) and the top edge of the proper left foot (fig. 10.20). Several lead-white-rich brushstrokes suggest that more highlights originally appeared on the shoes.\n\nAlthough the space in which the figure stands is somewhat ambiguous in the final painting, with no clear distinction between foreground and background, the transmitted-infrared image highlights a difference between the brushwork in the lower left corner, which consists of longer, more horizontal strokes (and possibly shows a slightly different lay-in of the shadows), and that further up in the composition, which consists of shorter and more vertical or diagonal strokes (fig. 10.21). This change in the brushwork could indicate a somewhat more defined border between foreground and background, at least in the early painting stage. An area of the foreground between the feet and the oysters that appears dense in the X-ray and transmitted-infrared images may indicate that Manet made a change there (fig. 10.22).\n\nAs mentioned above, there is some evidence that the canvas was pinned to a flat support for execution (see Original stretching) and then stretched on the stretcher. Based on the observation of a small length of the original tacking edges on each side, it appears that the artist may have made some slight adjustments to the overall dimensions of the painting. On the top and bottom edges, dark-brown paint from the composition extends beyond the current foldover and onto the tacking edges, suggesting that part of the painted area (approximately 1\u20132 cm) was turned over onto the top and bottom edges when the canvas was stretched (fig. 10.23, fig. 10.24). Along the lower right edge, there are some flattened brushstrokes of low impasto related to the oysters that appear to be the result of framing the work while the paint was still soft (fig. 10.25).\n\nBrushes, including 1 cm wide (based on width of brushstrokes). Wider brushes were probably used in the background and more broadly painted areas of the composition, but this is difficult to determine because the paint is relatively thin and well blended in these areas. Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nXRF analysis suggests the presence of the following pigments: lead white, red and yellow iron oxides, umber, vermilion, Prussian blue, viridian, and bone black.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting currently has a damar natural-resin varnish layer. The surface is even, saturated, and somewhat glossy.\n\nIn March 1953 the painting was cleaned and varnished.\n\nIn 1961\u201362 discolored surface films and overpaint were removed. Because of extensive abrasion in the background, the overpaint was only partially removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined. Further cleaning was carried out. A brush coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. The painting was stretched on an ICA redwood spring stretcher. Inpainting was carried out. A spray coat of L46 (Lucite: butyl methacrylate) was applied.\n\nIn 1982 the painting was surface cleaned to remove a \u201cmilky film.\u201d\n\nIn 1999 the synthetic varnish layers and retouching applied in 1962 were removed. Residues of earlier varnish were thinned. A thin brush coat of damar natural-resin varnish was applied. Minimal inpainting was carried out.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on the stretcher. The original tacking margins appear to be largely intact but are currently covered by strips of black adhesive tape that were applied after the painting was lined. The paint layer is secure. The 1961 examination report notes some abrasion in the paint from a previous treatment, especially in the background and the center of the blue robe. There are a couple of very small paint losses near the oysters. A pale-orange fill is exposed in these areas. There is cracking throughout most of the surface. Branched linear cracks are noticeable horizontally through the center of the painting, especially in the dark-blue cloak. There are drying cracks throughout the background and in many of the dark passages of the figure. Two scratches in the background, just above the oysters in the lower right corner, were documented in 1961. There are areas of localized inpainting and glazing throughout the work, mainly associated with areas of abrasion and open-aperture drying cracks. The painting has an even, somewhat glossy, damar natural-resin varnish. There is imbibed dust on the surface of the painting.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 1999): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a nineteenth-century French Second Empire Neoclassical scotia frame with an egg-and-dart outer ornament and a deep wide plain scotia with a bead-bordered hollow frieze and stepped flats at the sight edge. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and composition ornament. The gilding is burnished on the fillets on both sides and on the eggs of the outer ornament, the outside fillet of the beaded ornament, and the outside fillet of the stepped sight edge. All of the rest of the frame is matte gilded. It retains the original gilding and glue size. The compound pine moldings are glued and mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines. The molding from the perimeter to the interior is scotia side, fillet, torus with egg-and-dart, fillet, scotia, fillet, fillet with centered beaded ornament, fillet, hollow, fillet, fillet, and stepped filled with cove sight (fig. 10.26). The frame\u2019s section width is 19.8 cm (7 3/4 in.).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1967; removed 1999): The painting was previously housed in a mid-twentieth-century American straight-sided frame with an outer fillet, egg-and-dart ornament, and a fillet-and-cove sight. The frame was gilded and heavily toned (fig. 10.27).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933; removed by 1967): The painting was previously housed in what appears to be a twentieth-century molding frame (fig. 10.28, fig. 10.29, and fig. 10.30)\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1884; removed by 1933): The painting was framed in a nineteenth-century French Barbizon deep ogee Salon frame with what appears to be acanthus-ornamented ogee and laurel leaf on the rail. The frame was quite wide in section, descending to the sight opening with a stepped progression of flats and coves (fig. 10.31).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Jan. 1872, for 1,000 francs or 1,500 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Jean-Baptiste Faure, Paris, Nov. 13, 1882, as part of a group of three \u201cPhilosophes\u201d for 5,750 francs.\n\nSold by Jean-Baptiste Faure, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Oct. 16, 1894, for 10,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Arthur Jerome Eddy, Chicago, Oct. 16, 1894, for 20,000 francs.\n\nBy descent from Arthur Jerome Eddy (died 1920), to his wife, Mrs. Arthur Jerome (Lucy C.

See Jules-Michel Godet, \u201cOeuvres de M. Ed. Manet (24 photographies),\u201d Bibliographie de la France 61, 2nd ser., 16 (Apr. 20, 1872), p. 179; Gary Tinterow et al., Manet/Vel\u00e1zquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/Yale University Press, 2003), no. 145.\n\nThis painting had the following titles during the lifetime of the artist:\n\nMay 1867: Philosophe (Catalogue des Tableaux de M. \u00c9douard Manet expos\u00e9s Avenue de l\u2019Alma en 1867, exh. cat.

Ed. Manet [24 photographies],\u201d Bibliographie de la France 61, 2nd ser., no. 16 [Apr. 20, 1872], p. 179; Gary Tinterow et al., Manet/Vel\u00e1zquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting, exh. cat. [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York/Yale University Press, 2003], no. 145.)\n\nThe Art Institute currently uses the date that resulted from research conducted by Juliet Wilson-Bareau for the current entry, as well as for the 2008 exhibition The Age of French Impressionism. This date takes into consideration that the work might have been painted, or at least begun, prior to Manet\u2019s trip to Spain in September 1865, or perhaps just after his return to Paris. Further, because the painting was exhibited at Manet\u2019s retrospective on place de l\u2019Alma in 1867, this date constitutes a terminus ante quem.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the surface of the painting, suggests that the paint mixture contains iron oxides and probably bone black; other pigments may also be present. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_Beggar\\_1931\\_504\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Mar. 25, 2013, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe canvas fibers were not analyzed.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: \u00c9douard Manet, Beggar with Oysters (Philosopher) (RW99/1931.504),\u201d Mar. 2013.\n\nThis estimate was based on the distance between old tack holes observed in the X-ray. The original tacking edges could be only partially studied due to the presence of black tape applied to the edges after the 1962 lining (see Conservation History).\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination report, Dec. 1, 1961, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, including wax-resin lining.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. Microscopically, some dark-brown and black particles were observed, and XRF analysis detected traces of iron and calcium in the ground layer, which could be due to the presence of iron oxides or bone black, but further analysis would be required to confirm this. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_Beggar\\_1931\\_504\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Mar. 25, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMan\\_Beggar\\_Oysters\\_1931\\_504\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d Jan. 31, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe extent of scraping or wiping in the dark-brown background is difficult to assess given the presence of abrasion caused by early restoration treatments and subsequent retouching that was documented in the 1962 and 1999 treatments (see Conservation History).\n\nA few inches of the black tape applied to the edges after the 1962 lining (see Conservation History) were removed from each edge in order to observe the original tacking edges.\n\nThe dark-brown paint from the background curves over the left and right foldovers to a lesser extent, with more of the unpainted ground visible on both of those sides. Complete removal of the tape from all of the edges would be necessary to gain a clearer understanding of the nature of any adjustments made to the dimensions of the painting.\n\nXRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.

(Gallimard/Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 2011), pp. 284\u201385. Manet made his own record of the works sold, which survives as a transcript made by L\u00e9on Leenhoff (see MS Leenhoff, notebook Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France, Estampes et photographie, RESERVE 8-YB3-2401) and includes a small group (described as \u201c4 philosophes\u201d) that Manet notes was sold to the dealer for 6,000 francs total. According to the Durand-Ruel archives, the present work was purchased either as no. 952 (Le Philosophe) for 1,000 francs, or as no. 956 (Le Mendiant) for 1,500 francs (Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1868\u201383); see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 13, 2018, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe transaction is recorded in the Durand-Ruel, Paris, stock book for 1877 (as no. 1189) and in the stock book for 1880\u201384 (as no. 1171, Le Mendiant, and also as no. 2628, Le Philosophe). See Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, June 13, 2018, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. The archives warn that \u201cthe titles \u2018Le Mendiant\u2019 and \u2018Le Philosophe\u2019 have been used indifferently by Durand-Ruel,\u201d which is clearly reflected here.
