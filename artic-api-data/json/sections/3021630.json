Willing Fund, 1923.424\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">This bracelet, dating to between the first and third centuries A.D., is made from a hollow cylinder of worked gold. At 27.9 grams, the gold weighs in at the equivalent of about four months\u2019 wages. The main body of the cylinder curves around to form the ring shape of the bracelet, with the ends of the tube overlapping to a length of nearly a quarter of the full circumference of the ring. The tube is sealed at either end to simulate the appearance of a (substantially more costly) solid worked gold bar. Where each end of the tube is melted and sealed, a long, thin gold wire is attached and extended from this main body, abruptly bent at a right angle to the direction from which it stems, and repeatedly coiled, nine times, around the adjacent overlapping body of the opposite end of the rounded tube. This worked piece of gold is thus extended, via these more finely wrought sections of wire, to become the ornamental fastening by which its own ambit is completed and doubly secured at points approximately equidistant from each overlapping cylinder end. This area of just over a third of the bracelet\u2019s full circumference thereby carries all the detail of its design.\n\nThe impact of this piece is wrought through its simplicity. Formally, there is the neat arrangement of a single loop intersected by miniature echoes of its own shape. These encircle the main tube of gold just as the larger loop of the bracelet would encircle the arm of the woman wearing it\u2014a tidy crescendo of simple bands ringing, and thereby complementing, a still more important body. Each shape lends attention to what lies beyond it. Yet internally, the simplicity of form projects the majority of attention onto the expense and aesthetic quality of the gold itself. The main ring of the bracelet\u2014although almost circular in cross section\u2014has been worked on both its inner and outer circumferences and upper and lower sides, to create slightly flattened edges that give the main ambit a slight angularity with which to better catch and reflect the light. Tones within the gold, which oscillate between warm red and cold white, are thereby accentuated in its luster.\n\nThis type of bracelet, with an overlapping central tube and coiled fastenings that create a spring effect, was worn across the Roman Empire with examples found in places as far apart as Britain, Germany, Switzerland, and France, in the west, and Serbia, Bulgaria, Egypt, and possibly even the Ukraine, in the east. The form evidently enjoyed widespread popularity in the Roman world. Variations exist in which the coiling wire is finally twisted to become a rosette that lies flush with the surface of the bracelet; there are others in which the central shaft is made of a group of thick gold wires twisted together, instead of a hollow bar. The date range assigned to these bracelets is also very wide, stretching in the Roman period from the first to the third century\u2014and with other examples from both Greece and Egypt given a still earlier Hellenistic date. In one remarkable Egyptian case, a pair of bracelets of this broad type was excavated in the tomb of Pharaoh Siphtah, which\u2014if the context was entirely undisturbed\u2014would give them a date in the twelfth century B.C. This Roman fashion thus appears to have been based on a form that had antecedents of an exceptional antiquity.  \nNicola Barham\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Previously published in Berge and Alexander, \u201cAncient Gold Work and Jewelry from Chicago Collections,\u201d cat. 44, p. 12.\n\nThis value assumes a later first-century date, when an aureus weighed 7.2 g and was the equivalent of a laborer\u2019s wage for a month.

See further the \u201cPrivate Collection\u201d and \u201cOnce Art Market\u201d examples listed in Rudolph, Golden Legacy, cat. 26A. Finger rings, earrings, and a pendant have also been found that employ this kind of coiling as part of their structure and design. See Riha, Der r\u00f6mische Schmuck, cats. 210\u201322 (in bronze); Crummy, Colchester Archaeological Report 2, cat. 1756, pp. 47\u201348 (in copper); Gr\u00fcneisen, Art chr\u00e9tien primitif, pl. 32; British Museum and DCMS, Portable Antiquities Scheme, WMID-E88DC6, https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/85443; Amandry, Collection H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Stathatos, vol. 3, cat. 225, pl. 44. For earrings, see Rudolph, Golden Legacy, cat. 79, with an overview of the type and its diffusion from Britain to Greece and Anatolia; for Anatolian examples of earrings that use this twisting form to create a hoop through which the earring is clasped, see also Ergil, Earrings, cats. 45, 49. For a pendant ring, see Lunsingh Scheurleer, \u201cFrom Statue to Pendant,\u201d figs. 6\u20137 (silver, from Trier).\n\nSee the references to rosettes and twisted wire core in notes 4\u20135 above.\n\nFor examples with contextual information (sometimes conjectural), see note 4 above. Two parallel versions with a Hellenistic date were found in Delos, in Greece: L\u00e9vy, \u201cTr\u00e9sor h\u00e9llenistique,\u201d cat. 5, fig. 17. Rudolph, Golden Legacy, cat. 26A (Indiana University Art Museum, Bloomington, 70.105.11A, dated here as 200/50 B.C.) also presents an example with uncertain provenance as belonging to the Hellenistic period, though without a supporting context, a Roman date seems equally possible. For examples said to be from Ptolemaic Egypt, see Vernier, Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, vol. 38, cat. 52113; Galerie Nefer, Ancient Jewellery, cat. 64, is similarly listed as \u201cPtolemaic, 2nd to 1st century B.C.\u201d\n\nVernier, Catalogue g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, vol. 48, cats. 52.582\u201383, pl. 19. These bracelets are of a construction similar to the examples discussed so far: a hollow gold tube that is lozenge in section bent into a ring and joined by a wire curled tightly around it at either end, with the wires twisted together in the center to form a rosette. Given excavation practices in the early twentieth century, it is hard to be certain that this very early date is correct. An example of unknown provenance in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli that is considered to be Roman has a similar form, with a lozenge/prism cross section and two frontal rosettes of twisted wire; see Siviero, Gli ori e le ambre, cat. 234, pl. 172c (Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli, Naples, 25259, 1st century B.C./1st century A.D.).\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 163 Bracelet, 1st/3rd century A.D.\n\n</section>",
