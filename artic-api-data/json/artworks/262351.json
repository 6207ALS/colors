    "description": "<p>The Sullivaniana collection is largely the gift of George Elmslie, one of Sullivan\u2019s last colleagues and the executor of his estate. This grouping forms the largest extant collection of Sullivan documents (excluding architectural and design drawings). Among Sullivan\u2019s contributions to the development of modern American architecture was the new aesthetic for the visual organization of tall buildings: a strong base at grade level, top floors capped with an eye-arresting cornice, and the general office floors in the central shaft repeatable ad infinitum. Sullivan was one of the most prolific architect/critics of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and numerous draft manuscripts and typescripts of his writings are held in this collection. Also included are sketches, personal and business correspondence, personal and project photographs, and memorabilia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Sullivaniana%20Collection/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Sullivaniana%20Collection/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/louis%20sullivan%21adler%20sullivan/field/all%21all/mode/all%21all/conn/or%21or/order/title\">Find all Sullivan-related digital images.</a></p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/node/1055\">Louis Sullivan Collection</a><br>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/node/1315\">Louis Sullivan Buildings Extant in Chicago</a></p>\n<p>Collection access:<br>Collections may be accessed in the Franke Reading Room of the Research Center at The Art Institute of Chicago, by appointment only.
