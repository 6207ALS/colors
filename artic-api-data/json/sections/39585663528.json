For Gauguin, the experience of the countryside, about which he often talked in terms of color, was of great importance. His interest in the way natural elements could be manipulated for decorative effect manifests in works he did in France, such as the 1885 painting Red Roof by the Water [fig. 44.2 [W 2002 193]). Here Gauguin imbued a rather banal landscape with dazzling vibrancy through color and surface. The red of the roof cuts through the green of the leaves, resulting in decorative shapes. The overall texture of the hatched lines creates additional dynamism.\n\nThe light and color that confronted Gauguin in Polynesia was the most intense he had known. He wrote of Tahiti, \u201cEverything in the landscape blinded and dazzled me. Coming from Europe I was always unsure of a color . . . yet it was so easy to put a red and a blue on my canvas, naturally. The forms in golden streams enchanted me.\u201d Such effects were increasingly critical to Gauguin. On August 14, 1888, he shared with his artist friend \u00c9mile Schuffenecker a statement deeply indicative of his emerging artistic philosophy: \u201cSome advice: do not paint too much after nature. Art is an abstraction; derive this abstraction from nature while dreaming before it, and think more of the creation which will result than of nature.\u201d\n\nIncreasingly for Gauguin, the term \u201cabstraction\u201d was not at odds with the aim of representation. Rather, the two combined to create what he termed the \u201cpoetry of the decorative,\u201d harnessing human imagination to counter the \u201cservile imitation of nature.\u201d Nature was a starting point; artistic imagination created art. In works like the present sheet, he put his ideas into practice.\n\nThe abstract quality of Tahitian Hut is a function of the spatial ambiguity of the image, coupled with the juxtaposition of chromatic zones that seem to celebrate color for its own sake. A dark-blue patch indicates a door, while an area of purple and green constitutes the traditional thatched roof. To the left of the hut is a wash of green, blue, and brown watercolor, presumably a grassy area. To the right of the hut is another, bigger structure, with a rectangular entranceway. Peter Zegers suggested that the smaller building\u2014possibly a place for eating\u2014is attached to the larger one\u2014a residence\u2014in what was a typical architectural arrangement. At center right one sees the back of a seated female figure involved in an undisclosed activity. To the figure\u2019s right is a blue wash that may indicate water. A brown tree trunk leads into a mass of three different colored areas: blue, green, and red, each articulated with strong vertical hatching in dark watercolor. None of these patches represents foliage that is in any way obviously attached to the tree trunk itself. Instead, these brightly hued areas draw the eye across the top of the sheet, creating an organic interplay between foliage, sky, and man-made structures.\n\nYet, apparently, this unifying use of color was not initially planned. Infrared imaging of the sheet reveals a preliminary graphite sketch underneath the paint (fig. 44.3). This underdrawing illustrates the evolution of the design. In the sketch, Gauguin depicted the small hut more clearly, with the roof as a single area, but in the finished watercolor he obscured its shape. He employed color to merge the relationships between the foliage and the structures and create decorative abstractions.\n\nPreliminary sketches for the Art Institute\u2019s watercolor are recorded on two pages of Gauguin\u2019s unbound 1891\u201393 Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian sketchbook; fig. 44.4). Examination of these drawings and consideration of the differences between them and the Art Institute\u2019s sheet strongly suggest that Gauguin\u2019s principal interest in the latter was color effects. The sketch on the right-hand page establishes the spatial arrangement of the scene\u2019s various elements. The sketch does not clarify whether the architecture is intended to be one structure or two, despite the addition of a second, large opening or door to the right of the figure. In the sketchbook, Gauguin annotated the thatched roof of the hut with the designation \u201cviolet pourpre\u201d (violet purple). This unexpected color for a thatched roof suggests why Gauguin may have been compelled to record the scene, which he clearly depicted from life. The chromatic instruction is followed in the watercolor.\n\nThe left-hand page in the Carnet de Tahiti relating to the present work presents two sketches of the figure. Seen from the back, the figure at the upper right (whose gender is not clear) appears to be involved in an activity of some sort; it remains undisclosed in the watercolor as well. The figure at the lower center, here clearly female, is depicted in a three-quarter view, affording just a glimpse of her face, her head lowered to suggest her attention to whatever work in which she is engaged. In the watercolor, Gauguin maintained the figure\u2019s identity as a female and used the posture of the figure at the upper left of the sketch. Perhaps the woman remains in the watercolor to establish scale, but Gauguin\u2019s overriding interest in chromatic effects, even in relationship to her, is confirmed by the daubs of bright red decorating her skirt.\n\nGauguin\u2019s longstanding engagement with landscape was encouraged by his early mentor the Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro and influenced by his admiration for Paul C\u00e9zanne. As Richard Schiff argued, for Gauguin, C\u00e9zanne opened up the possibility for painting to represent human emotion, moving away from traditional forms of mimetic or naturalistic representation. Like C\u00e9zanne, Gauguin believed that nature is primarily something to be manipulated. By moving away from mimetic representation, through color and/or spatial arrangements, Gauguin imbued his landscapes with a sense of mystery and symbolic meaning.\n\nThroughout his career, Gauguin spoke to the ability to harness one\u2019s imagination as one of the most important skills of an artist. Dario Gamboni developed this idea in a recent study, in which he claimed that Gauguin\u2019s art primarily stemmed from his mind more than his eye. According to Gamboni, his abstraction of nature reduced and simplified forms, allowing visual signs to hold multiple associations, for artist and viewer alike.  \nHannah Klemm\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">During Gauguin\u2019s first journey to Tahiti, he created works in a variety of media on paper to document the flora and fauna of his surroundings and those who inhabited the island. Although many of these works took the form of small sketches (some with color) executed in bound volumes, this watercolor composition was done on a slightly larger sheet of paper of a type that would not have been used in a sketchbook because of its lack of strength and internal sizing. It evokes an extemporaneous moment, painted in a spontaneous manner, although the graphite underdrawing and applications of wet-over-dry watercolor belie a more measured working method, as does the existence of a closely related page in the artist\u2019s Carnet de Tahiti (Tahitian Sketchbook) (fig. 44.5).\n\nGauguin executed this work in watercolor, which he applied in broad strokes over a graphite underdrawing (see below). In the foreground wet-in-wet wash applications are visible (fig. 44.6), while in the remainder of the composition, underlayers of watercolor were allowed to dry before additional colors were added over them (fig. 44.7). To the right in the tree trunk, the strokes of watercolor became drier and drier as the medium discharged from the brush. Gauguin added white gouache selectively and mixed it with yellow watercolor in passages of opaque pale yellow in the background to the left. He also included small touches of red gouache in the skirt of the seated figure.\n\nThe artist used a poor-quality, acidic, wood-pulp paper that has darkened significantly, altering the tonal arrangement of his composition. The sheet has numerous fibrous inclusions and small particles of wood are visible throughout. In transmitted light, the fibers appear evenly distributed across the sheet. In raking light, the fibrous quality of the paper is enhanced, and the small wood inclusions appear more pronounced. The surface texture visible on the verso of the sheet is indicative of a machine-made wove paper. Although not a fine-art paper, the sheet was sized well enough to be conducive to applications of wet media. The artist\u2019s ability to control the consistency of his watercolor washes in response to the absorbency of the paper reflects his proficiency with the medium.\n\n165 \u00d7 247 mm\n\nIn this watercolor Gauguin did not clearly render the structure of the hut, preferring instead to emphasize its organic nature by merging it with the surrounding foliage. In order to fully understand how the artist developed the composition, it is necessary to look beyond its surface. The infrared image clearly reveals the preliminary graphite sketch beneath the watercolor washes (fig. 44.8). Rather than a belabored study of forms, the underlying sketch provided a visual shorthand\u2014a few lines quickly dashed off to place compositional elements before the artist began to paint. Gauguin indicated a palm leaf with two parallel lines. He anchored the figure with a few brief strokes. A tangled squiggle signifies a banana leaf, and a rapid zigzag the tree trunk. The spontaneous quality of these dashes and scribbles can be misleading, however, when the infrared image is placed side by side with the aforementioned sketchbook page (fig. 44.9). Comparison of the two reveals a nearly identical drawing in which the compositions are the same and the drawn shorthand in the sketchbook page signifies the same compositional elements found in the underdrawing. The meaning of certain marks such as the parallel dashes in the upper right is ambiguous in both. One notable difference is the foreground figure. The figure in the underdrawing is clearly based on a sketch drawn on the adjacent sketchbook page facing the Tahitian hut rather than the pair of figures present in that sketch. Gauguin annotated his sketch with the color notations violet (\u201cviolet\u201d) and, beneath that, pourpre (\u201cpurple\u201d) to indicate the color of the roof at left. He then proceeded to use those colors in the watercolor. Were it not for the fact that the sheet sizes vary significantly, one might easily mistake the now-lost sketchbook page with this watercolor. Given the similarity between the watercolor\u2019s underdrawing and the sketchbook page, a determination as to whether Gauguin executed the watercolor in situ shortly after resolving the forms in his sketchbook or if he did so later would be speculative.\n\nThe sheet was once edge mounted, but by the time the work entered the museum\u2019s collection in 2002, that mount had been removed and only residual paper and adhesive remained along the edges.\n\nOverexposure to light has darkened the paper and caused selective fading of the watercolor. In one instance, yellow watercolor has struck through the sheet in the lower left and remains unfaded on the verso, suggesting the original vibrancy of that color. A number of the colors present have been similarly diminished by light exposure, as some have dulled and others have become quite pale.\n\nThe sheet was conserved at the time of its acquisition by the Art Institute. Residual papers, adhesives, and old hinges were removed from the verso. Where the paper was slightly torn and skinned from earlier removal of the previous mount, it was mended with Japanese paper fibers and wheat starch paste.  \nHarriet K.
