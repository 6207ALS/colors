Although it is not identified by title in the correspondence between the artist and his printers, The Fair may be one of two drawings that the Ways transferred to stone and proved on 26 November 1895 (app. II.4). During September and October, Whistler had been preoccupied with a series of transfer drawings made in the Govier family\u2019s blacksmith shop on Broad Street (cat. 120, cat. 121, cat. 122, cat. 123, cat. 124, cat. 125, cat. 127, cat. 128, cat. 129, and cat. 130). Later in October he departed from this subject matter to create The Little Steps, Lyme Regis (cat. 131). The handful of transfer drawings that followed, including The Fair, focus primarily on the streets and public gatherings of the seaside town.\n\nThe Fair was drawn on papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal, the thin French transfer paper that Whistler had used for the Lyme Regis images drawn in September and October. In early November the artist experimented briefly with a new transfer paper recommended to him by T. R. Way (see cat. 133 and cat. 134). However, after using Way\u2019s transfer paper for two drawings, Fifth of November (cat. 133) and Sunday, Lyme Regis (cat. 134), Whistler declared himself displeased with the \u201cshockingly lithographic\u201d effect that it imparted (letter 162A). It seems likely that, following these experiments, he returned to the familiar papier v\u00e9g\u00e9tal he had brought with him from Paris. It yielded effects quite different from those produced by the grained-stone surface of Way\u2019s paper.\n\nAlthough Whistler was disappointed with the proofs of many of his Lyme Regis lithographs, he must have been satisfied with The Fair. He elected to include it in the exhibition of his lithographs at the Fine Art Society in 1895\u201396 (app. V.1). There is no surviving evidence to suggest when marks at the center of the composition were cleaned off the stone, or who made the erasures. Presumably they were made in December or January, after Whistler\u2019s return to London from Lyme Regis.\n\nAs originally drawn and transferred, the image has a number of unresolved lines and shadows on the ground in the center of the composition.\n\nGlasgow: HAG, ivory laid paper (323 \u00d7 209 mm), signed. London: BM, cream wove proofing paper (250 \u00d7 181 mm).

A small remnant of one line remains in front of the standing man at left.\n\nChicago: AIC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 226 mm), signed; MWC, cream laid paper (287 \u00d7 232 mm), signed; SC, cream laid paper (333 \u00d7 251 mm).
