    "description": "<p>In 1961, Wilbert and Marilyn Hasbrouck established the Prairie School Press in Chicago to publish important but out-of-print architecture sources on or by the Prairie School architects. They issued facsimile editions of numerous titles, including Louis Sullivan\u2019s A System of Architectural Ornament According with a Philosophy of Man\u2019s Powers, and The House Beautiful, illustrated by Frank Lloyd Wright. The Hasbroucks\u2019 journal, The Prairie School Review, published from 1964 to 1981, was the earliest scholarly journal to feature illustrated articles on various Prairie School projects, reviews of current publications, and preservation news. The collection includes much unpublished material: manuscripts, photographs, research notes, and correspondence with scholars regarding current research projects. It also holds the editorial and production records of The Prairie School Review.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/findingaids/searchterm/Prairie%20School%20Press%20Archives/field/title/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View finding aid.</a><br><a href=\"http://digital-libraries.artic.edu/cdm/search/collection/mqc/searchterm/Prairie%20School%20Press%20Archives/field/subcol/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">View selected images from this collection.</a><br><a href=\"https://digital-libraries.artic.edu/digital/collection/caohp/search/searchterm/Hasbrouck,%20Wilbert%20R./field/creato/mode/all/conn/and/cosuppress/1\">Wilbert R.
