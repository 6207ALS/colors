    "description": "<p>The Spanish Inquisition (symbolizing religious intolerance) is personified as a sinister-looking woman carrying a sword and holding a flaming vessel. She stands triumphantly atop the prone body of Truth. Peering out from behind her is a Dominican friar, an instrument of her authority.<br>Fuseli\u2019s painted sketch (a study for an unpublished engraving) illustrates lines from the early American poet Joel Barlow\u2019s <em>Columbiad</em> (published 1807), an epic account in verse of the founding of the United States. Barlow had commissioned illustrations from Fuseli, which were ultimately rejected. Notably, Fuseli painted this study directly on a reproductive engraving of one of his own paintings, which was presumably close at hand.</p>\n",
