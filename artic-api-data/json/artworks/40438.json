    "description": "<p>Paul Pontius was trained as a painter prior to studying engraving. By the age of 24, he was a master in the Antwerp guild and was the primary artist responsible for making engravings after the work of Peter Paul Rubens. During his life, Rubens closely supervised the printmakers who reproduced his work, encouraging them to imitate his style as closely as possible. Pontius actually lived in Rubens\u2019s house until a year after the painter\u2019s death, at which time he went on to make engravings, such as this one, after Anthony van Dyck and other artists like Titian and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez. He also became a well-known portrait engraver.</p>\n",
