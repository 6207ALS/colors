    "transcript": "<p>Announcer: Elvis Presley as Pacer, who became a legend in the West.</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: Whether Flaming Star was a good movie, it didn't matter. It was all about the image; not<br>necessarily what would sell monetarily, but what would sell the consumer attention?</p>\n<p>Narrator: Assistant curator Robyn Farrell.</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: Warhol took an image of Elvis Presley posing in this very kind of clich\u00e9d gendered masculine stance. The seriality that you see in Triple Elvis heightens the sense of a moving image, but at the same time, it gives a sense of maybe an unwinding reel of film. That's most immediately seen when looking at, say, the installation images from the exhibition that this work was a part of at Ferus Gallery. The notes from Warhol that were sent to Irving Blum, the director, was to cut the image in a way that would fit on the stretchers that came in the accompanying box. Irving Blum called Warhol and said--</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: You actually want me to make the decision to cut the canvas?</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: He said--</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: Yes, yes. Just-- all that I ask is that you line the gallery with the work and make sure that the stretchers match up with the figures.</p>\n<p>Robyn Farrell: Like other objects that he turned focus on, such as Coca-Cola bottles or soup cans, at this time, he was turning to fame and the function of fame and culture, really, actually, taking celebrities as a pop cultural object to repeat in multiple forms, and criticizing the obsession that he himself even had with celebrities.</p>\n",
