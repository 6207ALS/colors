    "description": "<p>In the early 1960s, Goldberg began developing a new, less costly method of concrete construction for low-rise buildings. Unlike the core structure of Marina City, his design for the Joseph Brenneman Elementary School in Chicago featured lightweight sprayed concrete and formwork to allow more flexible configurations of interior space. In keeping with Goldberg\u2019s humanist goals for the architectural profession, he placed special emphasis on the design and programming of educational buildings, which he believed should express the highest values of society. Unlike many schools\u2019 rigid institutional quality, Brenneman\u2019s classrooms were designed as individual sculptural shells, offering the intimate experience of a one-room schoolhouse, in close proximity to areas for group activity. Goldberg\u2019s unconventional flaring shell classrooms contain individual lockers and high windows that allow light to pour into the classroom\u2014features designed to promote student creativity and emotional connections to the educational process.</p>\n",
