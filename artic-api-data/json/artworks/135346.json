    "description": "<p>Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz arrived in Paris from Hungary in 1925. His timing as a photographer was fortunate: within a couple of years, new French magazines such as <em>Vu</em>, <em>Voil\u00e0</em>, and <em>Regards</em> were gaining a wide audience, and they turned to Kert\u00e9sz\u2014 along with Germaine Krull, Man Ray, Eli Lotar, and Brassai, among others\u2014to fill their pages. Kert\u00e9sz made some of his most influential images while on assignment for these magazines, including a series of nudes commissioned by the racy <em>Le Sourire</em> in 1933. The photographer posed his models in front of funhouse mirrors like those in Paris\u2019s Luna Park amusement grounds. He employed three mirrors and two women (one older, one younger), making almost two hundred images in sessions he later described as \u201cabsolute fun.\u201d Twelve images appeared in the magazine\u2014a series as unsettling as it was seductive.</p>\n",
