The composition is deceptively simple, for this canvas is both a fragment and a palimpsest, cut down and extensively repainted by the artist, possibly in multiple campaigns, between 1867 and 1875. The boy, also known as the Buveur d\u2019eau (Water Drinker) and the Gamin \u00e0 la cruche (Urchin with a Pitcher) began life as a member of a family of gypsies in Manet\u2019s large-scale, self-consciously hispanist Les Gitanos (The Gypsies [RW I 41]), painted in about 1862 and first exhibited at the Galerie Martinet in 1863 under the hybrid French-Spanish title that reflected Manet\u2019s interest in Iberian culture. An etching (fig. 14.1; [Harris 18]) published in September 1862 preserves the original composition in reverse, with a swaggering male gypsy at center, one arm akimbo, guitar strapped to his back, and a barefoot female companion seated at right holding an infant across her lap. Two onions or garlic bulbs tumble from a basket into the foreground, and the boy with a pitcher takes up his station behind the seated woman. In the background, a low horizon of trees and mountains opens onto a vast expanse of sky.\n\nBoy with Pitcher is one of three surviving fragments from the original canvas. The others are a still life with a basket and onions or garlic (fig. 14.2; [RW I 44]) and a half-length portrayal of the central gypsy, known as The Bohemian (fig. 14.3; [RW I 42]), both today in the collection of the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Both Abu Dhabi pictures exhibit signs of reworking, but in neither case is this reworking so extensive as that in the Chicago picture. Most obviously, after severing the boy from the rest of the composition, Manet scraped down and painted over the head of the seated female gypsy; the contours of her hair and forehead are still discernible to the naked eye through the boy\u2019s shirt (see fig. 14.4); her downturned eyes, partially reworked into the folds of the overlying garment, appear quite plainly in the X-ray (see fig. 14.5 and Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). Close examination of the boy\u2019s shirt, moreover, reveals flesh tones still visible through the semitransparent gray and white strokes, which were laid down directly over the woman\u2019s face with no apparent barrier between. But Manet did not confine his changes to the lower portion of the canvas: the blue sky of the landscape background\u2014still visible along three tacking edges whose bright color matches the background of the Abu Dhabi Bohemian\u2014was painted out, replaced with a neutral brown that skips, in many places, over the boy\u2019s pink skin. After painting out the sky, Manet reworked and re-emphasized the contours of the figure\u2014with pink paint skipping, in turn, over brown\u2014to give the boy his vigorous silhouette, reminiscent of a Daumier caricature. The artist\u2019s signature appears at lower right, swiftly applied in dark-brown (nearly black) paint over the neutral brown layer, granting this reworked fragment the status of a finished picture (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report).\n\nThe water drinker\u2019s survival and his second life as an independent composition are particularly remarkable, given that he may have been a relatively late addition to the original scene\u2014almost an afterthought. A layer of blue is visible, in some areas, under the boy; although there is not sufficient evidence to know whether the whole figure was dropped in over the sky, the light-brown layer describing the child\u2019s trousers at the bottom center of the canvas clearly sits atop a layer of blue paint (see fig. 14.6), and so it is possible that this figure was added to The Gypsies once the central portion of the composition was already well established (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). The addition\u2014if addition it was\u2014cannot have occurred too late in the progress of the original picture, however, for an awkward etching (fig. 14.7; [Harris 17]), true to the orientation of the painted composition and apparently executed during its development, already includes the water drinker, crammed in at the edge of the plate.\n\nVarious iconographic programs have been proposed for The Gypsies: an allegory of the five senses, an exploration of the Manet family\u2019s internal dynamics, the holy family\u2019s rest on the flight into Egypt, the myth of the child stolen by gypsies. The last of these had been treated to much acclaim by Henri Schlesinger in an 1861 Salon painting (see fig. 14.8), which served as a model for Manet\u2019s other major gypsy subject, The Old Musician (fig. 14.9; [RW I 52]). Manet was not alone in his interest in gypsies: the itinerant lives of the Roma people\u2014gitans, tziganes, or boh\u00e9miens, as they were called in nineteenth-century Paris\u2014formed a source of endless fascination for painters, writers, and social scientists of the period, figuring in novels by authors as varied as Victor Hugo and \u00c9mile Zola, in the urban typological guides of popular anthropology, and, perhaps most importantly, in the poems of Charles Baudelaire, whose 1852 \u201cTraveling Gypsies\u201d (Boh\u00e9miens en voyage), republished in Flowers of Evil (Les fleurs du mal) in 1857, casts the gypsy\u2014and his \u201cprophetic tribe\u201d\u2014as a surrogate for the artist, at once marginal and visionary.\n\nAn early etching by Manet known as The Travelers (fig. 14.10; [Harris 4]) and dated to about 1859 or 1860\u2014that is, fairly early in his acquaintance with Baudelaire\u2014corresponds in certain respects to this poem, evoking a family of vagabonds traveling on foot. With its apparently itinerant protagonist and nursing mother, The Gypsies takes up the same theme and bears a clear relationship to the substance and sentiment of Baudelaire\u2019s verse. Painted in Manet\u2019s new studio at no. 81 rue Guyot, The Gypsies drew on the artist\u2019s immediate\u2014Baudelairean\u2014environs in the Batignolles district, then a neighborhood of vacant lots and construction sites adjacent to the slum of La Petite Pologne (Little Poland). There, a population of recent migrants from Central Europe, Roma people, ragpickers, and others on the periphery of Parisian society, took refuge from new forms of official discrimination during the Second Empire.\n\n\u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton first suggested that Manet had used children from La Petite Pologne as models in the 1860s, and the artist is known to have employed a specific Roma man from the neighborhood as his model for The Old Musician. The Abu Dhabi Bohemian, with his high cheekbones and firm chin, plainly began as a portrait likeness, perhaps of another Roma neighbor. The possibly somewhat late addition to The Gypsies of the boy with a pitcher (whose features are far less particularized than those of the central figure) may indicate that the composition began as a typological portrait focused on a single standing figure\u2014akin to those of ragpickers, gypsies, and provincials that illustrated popular anthropologies (see, for example, fig. 14.11)\u2014and only later evolved into something more. Nonetheless, as in the case of The Old Musician, Manet\u2019s interest in the central gypsy was never merely anthropological: here, once again, the modern Parisian \u201ctype\u201d is cast in an art-historical drama, striking a pose borrowed from the past. The most likely prototype for the central figure in The Gypsies\u2014as Juliet Wilson-Bareau has argued\u2014was Philip IV of Spain in Hunting Costume, a portrait then attributed to Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and acquired by the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre in May 1862 (fig. 14.12). Manet seems to have copied this picture immediately upon its acquisition, first in a drawing (fig. 14.13; [RW II 68]) and then in a print (fig. 14.14 [Harris 15]), before adapting its regal pose for the central figure in The Gypsies.\n\nArt historians have proposed various Old Master prototypes for the other two figures in the original scene. The most convincing of these in terms of pose may be the reveler who pours wine into his mouth at upper right in Peter Paul Rubens\u2019s Triumph of Bacchus (fig. 14.15), which was already in Russia by the nineteenth century, but which Manet could have known through an engraving. In spirit, though\u2014and quite explicitly in title\u2014the lineage of The Gypsies was Spanish, and so the drinking boy\u2019s principal models must have been the picturesque urchins of Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo. These include The Young Beggar (also known as The Fleapicker; fig. 14.16), which was among the most frequently copied pictures at the Louvre in the mid-nineteenth century. Although Manet\u2019s friend and early biographer Antonin Proust reports that the artist was less fond of Murillo than of Vel\u00e1zquez, the basket of onions or garlic in The Gypsies is lifted more or less directly from the The Young Beggar; the earthenware jug, close-cropped hair, and childlike, self-forgetful air of Manet\u2019s water drinker, moreover, all point to Murillo\u2019s example.\n\nContemporary critics, however, related the scene to other Spanish masters. \u201c[Manet\u2019s] Gypsies appear inspired by Goya, at least in their general effect,\u201d Philippe Burty remarked in his review of the etching, and, in an account of the 1863 exhibition at Martinet\u2019s, Paul de Saint-Victor invoked Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s great Feast of Bacchus (referring to it as the Bevidores, or Drinkers): \u201c[Manet\u2019s] Gypsies have class and a fine aspect. I particularly like the one with his head thrown back who empties a jug into his open mouth; V\u00e9lasquez\u2019s [sic] Bevidores would take him into their brotherhood.\u201d Already at this early date, the apparent afterthought of the boy with a pitcher was attracting more positive notice than the overall composition. A review of the etching in the journal Les Beaux-Arts, for example, proclaimed, \u201cM. Manet\u2019s composition includes four figures, of which at least three are quite unbearable.\u201d In short, the ambitious\u2014if somewhat crowded and accretive\u2014composition found fewer early admirers than the simple figure of the boy with a pitcher.\n\nAnd so it is perhaps unsurprising that Manet singled out his well-received water drinker for inclusion on a sheet of ink-and-wash drawings (fig. 14.17 [cat. 8]; [RW II 371, 460, 532]) submitted to L\u2019Autographe au Salon et dans les ateliers, an amateur\u2019s guide to the exhibition and its personalities, in 1865. Manet signed and dated this sheet, also in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, April 2, 1865. It provides our earliest document of Manet\u2019s interest in isolating the boy with a pitcher from the rest of The Gypsies. The canvas nevertheless still remained intact in 1867, when Manet included it in his private exhibition in the avenue de l\u2019Alma. Hung beside The Old Musician, the picture was reproduced in a caricature by George Randon (fig. 14.18), who assigned it the comic caption, \u201cThe Gypsies, or Paternal Love. \u2018Who will take this thing off my hands? I\u2019ll give him the kid and my blessing into the bargain\u2019\u201d: a joke hinging on the racist stereotype of Roma people as baby snatchers.\n\nRandon\u2019s caricature is the last surviving trace of the whole picture. Whether ceding to criticism or pursuing his own line of pictorial inquiry\u2014an extreme version of the editorial process to which he subjected so many of his pictures\u2014Manet cut up the canvas, apparently salvaging just three fragments. That of the boy with a pitcher first resurfaced as an independent work in early 1872, in the aftermath of Manet\u2019s watershed sale of twenty-three canvases to the dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. At the conclusion of the sale, Manet drew up two lists in what Moreau-N\u00e9laton calls \u201ca small notebook that he used as an address book.\u201d The first was a list with prices of pictures sold to Durand-Ruel, and the second, an inventory, with values, of those remaining in the studio. The inventory comprises twenty-five pictures, including such celebrated multi-figure compositions as Luncheon on the Grass [RW I 67] and The Old Musician. Last on the list (and, with an assigned value of 600 francs, one of the cheapest) appears \u201cLa R\u00e9galade.\u201d\n\nBut how closely did this fragment resemble the Art Institute\u2019s picture by January 1872? Manet\u2019s list provides no dimensions or descriptions, and so we are left to wonder whether the canvas had yet been cropped to its current height and the blue sky painted out. A reversed etching of the same drinking boy (fig. 14.19; [Harris 43])\u2014 datable to between 1870 and 1874\u2014places him alone in a landscape, silhouetted against the sky and treated at half length. The boy\u2019s legs in this etching, however, are not nearly as carefully worked out as his upper body; little more than a series of vertical lines, they do not look as though they were copied from a painting. Moreover, had the canvas been tall enough by early 1872 to portray the drinking boy at half length, surely Manet would have assigned it a value more commensurate with that of his other half-length, Murillo-esque composition, Urchin with a Dog, which, like The Gypsies, features a straw basket and blue sky, and which Manet offered to Durand-Ruel at 1,500 francs.\n\nThe etching of the water drinker nevertheless raises the possibility that the Chicago fragment still possessed its original blue sky for a time after it was freed from the larger composition. If Manet did wait for a period of months or years before reworking this canvas one last time, might his decision to paint out the sky have been prompted by his spring 1872 visit to the Netherlands? In other words, might the inspiration for his final reworking have come not from Murillo or Vel\u00e1zquez, but from Frans Hals? In a letter written from Madrid in 1865, Manet had expressed admiration for the skill with which Vel\u00e1zquez handled the neutral background space in his Portrait of Pablo Valladolid (fig. 14.20), but, while he plainly aimed to achieve a similar effect in pictures painted immediately upon his return from Spain\u2014notably The Tragic Actor (fig. 14.21; [RW I 106])\u2014his treatment of the neutral background in Boy with Pitcher is quite different. The brown here is far darker and more opaque, with none of the airy quality Manet had admired in the portrait at the Museo del Prado.\n\nThe effect is in fact closer to that achieved in Le Bon Bock (fig. 14.22; [RW I 186]), Manet\u2019s great success at the Salon of 1873. That picture, frankly indebted to the Netherlands and to Hals, bears an important relationship to the latter\u2019s Merry Drinker (fig. 14.23) in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. A recent viewing of that picture\u2019s vigorous brushwork and unpretentious composition might also have informed Manet\u2019s final reworking of Boy with Pitcher. A Dutch-Spanish hybrid, the finished fragment left Manet\u2019s studio in September 1875, sold directly to the wealthy businessman Hubert Debrousse, for what Manet considered the \u201cquite respectable price\u201d of 1,500 francs, more than twice the value he had assigned the canvas just three years before. Debrousse had recently purchased a ch\u00e2teau and was amassing a large and important collection of pictures, new and old, to fill it. These included works by or attributed to Jusepe de Ribera and Rembrandt van Rijn, as well as important examples by Gustave Courbet and Alfred Stevens and what must have been the largest group of paintings by Th\u00e9odule Ribot ever assembled. Debrousse\u2019s taste, in other words, ran to Spanish and Dutch masters and to modern Realist painters whose work could be understood as part of the same tradition. In such company, Boy with Pitcher would have looked right at home.  \nEmily A. Beeny\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">\u00c9douard Manet\u2019s Boy with Pitcher is a fragment that the artist cut out of a larger group composition\u2014Les Gitanos (The Gypsies), painted around 1862\u2014and repainted around the figure. The artist cut the boy out of the original canvas on the top, bottom, and right sides, but the left edge appears to correspond to the original tacking edge of the larger painting. The support is a twill-weave canvas. The original dimensions of Boy with Pitcher were slightly smaller than a no. 12 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas. The ground is a warm, cream color. Remnants of the original composition are visible along the edges and, with the aid of X-ray and transmitted infrared imaging, underneath the boy\u2019s torso. Elements from the earlier painting include the top part of the woman\u2019s head, the background of blue sky, and a small area on the right edge that seems to correspond to the arm of the male figure in the original image. After the boy was cut out of the painting, Manet continued his shirt and pants over the female head, after scraping away most of the dark paint of her hair. He then applied the brown background, making small modifications to the contours of the boy and the pitcher as he worked back and forth between the figure and the background.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 14.24).\n\nSigned: Manet (lower right corner, in dark-brown paint) (fig. 14.25, fig. 14.26). The painting was dry when it was signed.\n\nLinen (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cropped out of a larger composition that is documented to have measured 190 \u00d7 130 cm. The original size of Boy with Pitcher was approximately 57.5 \u00d7 49.5 cm, measuring from the original foldover creases. These dimensions do not correspond exactly to a standard-size canvas, but are close to a no. 12 portrait (figure): 60 \u00d7 50 cm. During the 1968 conservation treatment, the tacking edges were flattened and the canvas was lined and restretched on a larger stretcher so that all of the original canvas is exposed on the same plane (see Conservation History).\n\nTwill weave (2/1) (fig. 14.27). Average thread count (standard deviation): 32.7V (1.5) \u00d7 32.3H (0.9) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Manet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is very slight cusping on the top edge, mild cusping on the right and bottom edges, and stronger cusping on the left edge. There are variations in the thread thickness throughout the canvas including several thicker threads in the horizontal direction.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the 1968 lining; copper tacks spaced approximately 7\u20138 cm apart. The lined canvas was restretched onto a larger stretcher in order to show the flattened tacking edges, onto which the earlier composition continues (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: After the canvas was cut from the larger group composition, it was mounted onto a new stretcher. New foldovers were created on the top, bottom, and right sides; the left edge, on the other hand, appears to be the original tacking edge of the larger composition. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes. There are a few additional small pinholes near the original foldovers but their origin and purpose are not known.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered redwood ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.7 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: The pre-1968-treatment stretcher was described as five-membered with a horizontal crossbar. Depth: Based on the presence of a second crease in the canvas on the top and left sides, presumably where excess canvas was folded onto the back face of the stretcher, the original stretcher depth was approximately 1.3\u20131.5 cm.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nBecause the canvas has been cropped on the top, bottom, and right sides, it cannot be determined if the canvas was pre-primed. The ground does, however, extend to the edge of the left tacking margin, which appears to correspond to the original edge of the larger painting. The ground, where it is exposed on the left edge, appears rather thick and has a brushmarked surface (see fig. 14.28).\n\nThe ground has a warm, cream tone.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground consists of lead white mixed with barium sulfate and traces of silica, calcium-based white, bone black, alumina and/or alumino-silicates.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThis painting is a fragment of a larger composition\u2014Les Gitanos (The Gypsies), painted around 1862, that Manet cut down. The X-ray shows the top two-thirds of the head of the female figure from the original painting, which overlapped the boy\u2019s torso (fig. 14.29). The woman\u2019s downturned eyes, most of her nose, and possibly an indication of her proper right ear are visible. Her dark hair, pulled up at the back of her head, is virtually transparent in the X-ray. The bulge at the back of the hair on her proper right side probably indicates a bun or hair adornment. The woman\u2019s face is thickly painted; this is particularly apparent when the density of the paint is compared with that of the boy\u2019s face in the X-ray. A narrow band of paint that includes part of the nose and cheeks of the woman is exposed at the bottom edge. Flesh-toned paint from the woman\u2019s face also remains visible on the surface of the painting where the boy\u2019s shirt does not completely cover it (fig. 14.30). The paint layer in the area of the woman\u2019s hair, by contrast, is very thin and, when the painting\u2019s surface is viewed in raking light, a distinct ridge or step is visible around the hairline and the upper contour of the hair (fig. 14.31) that suggests that the paint of the hair was scraped away; straight edges of marks from a rigid tool, such as a palette knife, are visible in these areas (fig. 14.32; fig. 14.33). In an area on the left side of the woman\u2019s head that remains visible through the thin paint of the boy\u2019s shirt, microscopic examination reveals traces of dark-brown paint and exposed ground which support the hypothesis that the hair was largely scraped away (fig. 14.34). The X-ray and transmitted infrared images also show a \u201chalo\u201d of dense brushwork around the woman\u2019s head (fig. 14.35). One possible explanation for this brushwork is that Manet first painted out the woman\u2019s hair with a lead-white-rich paint in an attempt to block out the dark color, which nonetheless continued to show through the lighter-toned paint layers of the repainted shirt of the boy, prompting the artist to ultimately scrape away the dark-brown paint along with the lighter paint applied on top (the latter just within the area of the hair).\n\nOther elements of the original composition are also visible on the top, right, and bottom edges of the canvas. To the left of the woman\u2019s head, the boy\u2019s pants extend to the bottom edge (fig. 14.36). On the lower right edge, there are strokes of reddish-brown, black, and gray paint that appear to be related to the arm of the man from the larger composition (fig. 14.37). Elsewhere on the three cut edges, blue paint is visible; it is presumably associated with the sky against which the figures were set. The blue varies in tone and often consists of a layer of intense blue paint covered by layers of gray and pale blue that appear scraped or abraded (fig. 14.38). At the top and bottom edges, the sky from the original composition ends approximately 4 cm from the left edge of the canvas (fig. 14.39 and fig. 14.40). The edge of the sky corresponds to a slightly more dense area in the X-ray (fig. 14.41). Microscopic examination of areas of loss and abrasion along the bottom edge indicate that the boy\u2019s pants were painted on top of the blue sky (fig. 14.42 and fig. 14.43). Blue paint from this earlier layer is also observed in other places throughout the figure (fig. 14.44 and fig. 14.45). The woman\u2019s head, on the other hand, looks like it was painted directly on top of the ground layer. It is unclear, however, whether the boy overlaps the blue paint layer only in areas, or whether he was painted entirely on top of the original blue-sky background.\n\nAfter Manet cropped the picture, he painted the lower half of the boy\u2019s shirt and the waistband of his pants over the woman\u2019s head, and painted out the sky of the earlier composition with the brown background. As revealed by transmitted-light imaging, the figure, for the most part, is quite thinly painted (fig. 14.46). There are small areas of exposed ground (fig. 14.47) and abrasion in underlying paint layers\u2014sometimes down to the canvas (fig. 14.48)\u2014which may indicate that areas of the figure were broadly scraped down before the final painting, which was largely carried out with wet-in-wet paint application. Manet worked back and forth between the figure and the background: in some places, the brown paint overlaps the figure (fig. 14.49); in others, the figure extends over the background (fig. 14.50). In the process, the artist made some small adjustments to the contours of the figure, including the facial profile and the position of the right arm, and to the pitcher (fig. 14.51).\n\nBrushes, including approximately 0.5 and 1.0 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). A straight-edged, rigid implement such as a palette knife was probably used to scrape away earlier paint layers.\n\nXRF analysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, iron oxide\u2013containing pigments including burnt umber, vermilion, cobalt blue, emerald green, and bone black.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has a synthetic varnish that was applied in 1968. Prior to this a yellowed natural-resin varnish was removed (Conservation History). The origin of the natural-resin varnish is not known.\n\nIn 1968 a yellowed natural resin varnish and overpaint were removed. The previously unlined canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on a redwood ICA spring stretcher. A stretcher of larger dimensions than the original was used in order to show the flattened tacking edges onto which the original composition continues (fig. 14.52). A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out in abraded areas. A layer of methacrylate L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA. At some point during this treatment, the brown background was extended onto the left and top tacking margins.\n\nThe canvas is wax-resin lined and is stretched taut and in plane on the stretcher. A stretcher of larger dimensions than the original was used in order to show the flattened tacking edges onto which the original composition extends (see fig. 14.52). The paint layer is secure. The paint appears to have been flattened somewhat in the thicker areas by the heat and pressure of the lining process. The brown background and the area over the painted-out face are extensively abraded, a condition documented in the 1968 examination report and treatment photographs (fig. 14.53). The ground and paint layers from the earlier composition that are exposed on the edges are also abraded and have numerous small losses. There is localized retouching in the area of the painted-out head and more broadly applied retouching throughout the background. In addition, after the painting was lined, the brown background was extended onto the left and top tacking edges. There is a general network of mechanical cracks and localized areas of drying cracks throughout the brown background. The painting has a synthetic varnish.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installation date unknown): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a late eighteenth-century French transitional Louis XV\u2013Louis XVI frame with foliate rocaille cartouches and cabled scotia and an independent liner. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and carved ornament. The gilding is burnished on the gadrooned rails, fillets on both sides of the frieze, and the independent liner. The frame has been almost entirely re-gilded. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled dovetailed splines, and has been reduced from its original size, rejoined with butt joints on either side of all the corner cartouches, and glued to a back frame.

See Juliet Wilson-Bareau to Gloria Groom, e-mail correspondence, May 12, 2009, and Feb. 14, 2017, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Wilson-Bareau explains (e-mail correspondence, Feb. 14, 2017) that La r\u00e9galade is very difficult to translate into English, but generally has to do with \u201cdrinking with head thrown back and mouth open, without touching the vessel.\u201d\n\nAs a reworked fragment, the date the Art Institute currently uses for this work includes the date of the earlier original canvas to which this work first belonged, The Gypsies (Les Gitanos) (RW I 41), as well as the latest date Manet is thought to have reworked the composition. See Laurence des Cars, \u201cPainting in Morceaux,\u201d in St\u00e9phane Gu\u00e9gan et al., Manet: The Man Who Invented Modernity, exh. cat.

Boulevard des Italiens: Exposition de tableaux anciens et modernes, exh. cat. (Galerie Martinet, 1863).\n\nThe print figured in the first issue of Eaux-fortes modernes (September 1, 1862), a publication of the newly founded Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des aquafortistes, published by Alfred Cadart. For this publication, see Janine Bailly-Herzberg, L\u2019Eau-forte de peintre au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle: La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des aquafortistes 1862\u20131867, 2 vols. (L. Laget, 1972).

Delteil, 1906), cat. 2. As Harris has pointed out, the continuous contours outlining the figures in the first state of this etching suggest that its composition was transferred to the plate by means of tracing, possibly from a photograph of the original painting. The publication of the etching in September 1862 thus provides a reasonably secure terminus ante quem for the picture.\n\nThe Gypsies originally measured 190 \u00d7 130 cm. See Catalogue des tableaux de M. \u00c9douard Manet expos\u00e9s avenue de l\u2019Alma en 1867, exh. cat. (L. Poupart-Davyl, 1867), cat. 9.\n\nA picture known as Gypsy with a Cigarette or Indian Woman with a Cigarette (c. 1861, possibly reworked in the 1870s; Princeton University Art Museum [RW I 46]), was long mistaken for a fourth fragment of The Gypsies. Anne Coffin Hanson\u2019s publication, however, of an X-ray of Boy with Pitcher resolved the matter; see Hanson, \u201cEdouard Manet, \u2018Les Gitanos,\u2019 and the Cut Canvas,\u201d The Burlington Magazine 112, 804 (Mar. 1970), pp. 158\u201367.\n\nThe Bohemian, lot 52 in the 1884 Manet sale, was photographed by Fernand Lochard with the contents of the artist\u2019s studio (no. 251). The canvas has been cut down on the right side since that photograph was taken. The still life with a basket and onions or garlic, a more recent discovery, was first published by Charles P\u00e9russaux in \u201cManet, coupeur des toiles,\u201d in Curiosit\u00e9 de l\u2019histoire de l\u2019art: Lettres fran\u00e7aises (Sept. 15, 1955), n.p. For these fragments, see Anne Coffin Hanson, \u201cEdouard Manet, \u2018Les Gitanos,\u2019 and the Cut Canvas,\u201d The Burlington Magazine 112, 804 (Mar. 1970), pp. 158\u201367; Laurence des Cars, \u201cLa peinture en morceaux,\u201d in St\u00e9phane Gu\u00e9gan et al., Manet, inventeur du Moderne, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 2011), pp. 44\u201355.\n\nSee Anne Coffin Hanson, \u201cEdouard Manet, \u2018Les Gitanos,\u2019 and the Cut Canvas,\u201d The Burlington Magazine 112, 804 (Mar. 1970), pp. 158\u201367. See also Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report; as Kim Muir points out there, a halo of brushstrokes around the female gypsy\u2019s head in the X-ray suggests that Manet may at first have attempted to mask her hair with lead white before realizing the original design was too dark to conceal. Plainly visible in raking light, diagonal tool marks in the area where Manet removed the female gypsy\u2019s hair suggest that vigorous scraping was required.\n\nWhen the canvas was lined and re-stretched by conservators at the Art Institute in the 1960s, the tacking edges were flattened, and the brown layer extended to cover them on the left and top sides, effectively enlarging the composition by an inch along those edges. When the picture left Manet\u2019s studio, the sky blue would still have been exposed from the original tacking margin to the top edge of the canvas. See Technical Summary in the technical report.\n\nThe still life of onions is also signed. The Bohemian is not.\n\nWitness the central figure\u2019s rakish hat in the early etching, which was replaced with a bandanna in the second etching and the Abu Dhabi Bohemian. On this print, see also Juliet Wilson-Bareau et al., Edouard Manet: Das graphische Werk, exh. cat. (Stadtverwaltung, 1977), cat. 16; Joel Isaacson, Manet and Spain: Prints and Drawings, exh. cat.

Delteil, 1906), cat. 61. As Harris has pointed out, the extreme awkwardness of this print confirms that Manet had trouble copying an image directly onto the plate in reverse.\n\nIn the allegorical interpretation, proposed by George Mauner, the mother and child stand for the sense of touch; the guitar, for hearing; the onions or garlic bulbs, for smell; the water, for taste; and the male gypsy\u2019s gaze, for sight. See Mauner, Manet: The Still Life Paintings (Abrams, 2000), p. 19.

If this portrait was in fact the inspiration for Manet\u2019s standing gypsy, he most likely painted The Gypsies between May and September 1862\u2014that is, between the portrait\u2019s acquisition by the Louvre and the publication of his second etching of the painting. Michael Fried has suggested various other sources for the pose of the central gypsy; see Michael Fried, \u201cManet\u2019s Sources,\u201d Artforum 7, 7 (Mar. 1969), pp. 28\u201382, 45\u201347; Fried, Manet\u2019s Modernism, or, The Face of Painting in the 1860s (University of Chicago Press, 1996), pp. 65, 86.\n\nFor the drawing, see Juliet Wilson, Manet: Dessins, aquarelles, eaux-fortes, lithographies, correspondance (Huguette Ber\u00e8s, 1978), cat. 7; Alain de Leiris, The Drawings of Edouard Manet (University of California Press, 1969), cat. 151.

After seeing autograph pictures by Vel\u00e1zquez at the Prado in 1865, Manet changed his opinion of the Louvre portrait: \u201cthe full-length portrait that we have in the Louvre is not from his hand\u201d (le portrait \u00e0 pied que nous avons au Louvre n\u2019est pas de lui).

The artist\u2019s adjustments to the borders of his compositions were not always as dramatic as in this case; for example, the Art Institute\u2019s Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers (cat. 5) and Bullfight (cat. 9) both exhibit more moderate adjustments made to their margins.\n\nOn this transaction, see Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, \u201cLes premiers achats de Paul Durand-Ruel \u00e0 Edouard Manet, 1872\u20131873,\u201d in St\u00e9phane Gu\u00e9gan et al., Manet, inventeur du Moderne, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 2011), pp. 284\u201385. The somewhat muddled account of the deal in Lionello Venturi\u2019s Archives de l\u2019impressionnisme (Durand-Ruel, 1939), vol. 2, pp. 189\u201390, is misleading with respect to Boy with Pitcher (La R\u00e9galade), which Paul Durand-Ruel\u2019s memoir seems to have confused with another Murillo-inspired urchin picture: the Urchin with Dog (c. 1861; [RW I 47]), which was in fact part of the dealer\u2019s purchase of twenty-three pictures.\n\nThe original French reads, \u201cun petit carnet utilis\u00e9 par lui comme livre d\u2019adresses.\u201d \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, Manet racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame (Henri Laurens, 1926), vol. 1, pp. 132\u201334.\n\n\u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, \u201cInventory,\u201d in Manet racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame (Henri Laurens, 1926), vol. 1, p. 134; the only other picture valued at 600 francs was the modest Hare (c. 1866; [RW I 118]), today at the Fondation Angladon-Dubrujeaud in Avignon.\n\nJuliet Wilson-Bareau has dated this print to 1870\u201371, rejecting the previous consensus of 1865, because the address printed on the verso of the plate corresponds to premises occupied by Manet\u2019s supplier from 1870 to 1874 (Ane Mon Godard. P. VALIANT Sucr./ 27 RUE DE LA HUCHETTE/ PARIS); see Juliet Wilson, Manet: Dessins, aquarelles, eaux-fortes, lithographies, correspondence, exh. cat. (Huguette Ber\u00e8s, 1978), cat. 33. See also Jean C. Harris, Edouard Manet: The Graphic Work, A Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9, rev. ed. (Alan Wofsy, 1990), cat. 43. The spare treatment of the landscape in this print also bears some relationship to Manet\u2019s illustrations for \u201cLe Fleuve,\u201d a poem by Charles Cros, published in 1874; see Harris, Edouard Manet: The Graphic Work, cat. 79.\n\nNor, for that matter, does the insubstantial water jar that stands beside him.\n\nAt 92 \u00d7 72 cm, Urchin with Dog (c. 1861; RW I 47]) is almost half again as large as La R\u00e9galade, which measures 62 \u00d7 54 cm. Urchin with Dog was assigned the price of 1,500 francs in Manet\u2019s list; see \u00c9tienne Moreau-N\u00e9laton, Manet racont\u00e9 par lui-m\u00eame (Henri Laurens, 1926), vol. 1, p. 132. The artist seems, however, to have accepted a discounted price for the bulk purchase (a total of 35,000 francs, as opposed to the asking price of 40,700), and so the payment recorded for Urchin with Dog in Durand-Ruel\u2019s stock book is 1,000 francs. See Paul-Louis Durand-Ruel and Flavie Durand-Ruel, \u201cLes premiers achats de Paul Durand-Ruel \u00e0 Edouard Manet,\u201d in St\u00e9phane Gu\u00e9gan et al., Manet, inventeur du Moderne, exh. cat. (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, 2011), pp. 284\u201385.\n\nPerhaps Manet even toyed with the possibility of extending the fragmentary canvas with a strip at the bottom, as he had for the Absinthe Drinker (c. 1859; Ny Karlsberg Glyptotek [RW I 19]); see Charles Stuckey, \u201cManet Revised: Whodunit?,\u201d Art in America 71 (Nov. 1983), p. 163.\n\nManet made three documented visits to the Netherlands: one in summer 1852, one in October 1863, and one in May 1872. He registered in the visitor\u2019s log at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam in 1852 and 1872, and at the Haarlem Municipal Museum in 1872. For these travels and Manet\u2019s experience of Dutch art, see Lawrence Nichols, \u201cManet and Hals: Two Geniuses, One Vision,\u201d in MaryAnn Stevens and Lawrence W. Nichols, Manet: Portraying Life, exh. cat.

See \u00c9douard Manet to Fantin-Latour, September 3, 1865, in Juliet Wilson-Bareau, ed., Manet par lui-m\u00eame (\u00c9ditions Atlas, 1991), p. 34. For the English translation, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, ed., Manet by Himself: Correspondence and Conversation: Paintings, Pastels, Prints and Drawings (Macdonald, 1991), p. 34.\n\nAntonin Proust reported that Manet had always treated Hals as a kind of honorary Spanish master, remarking, apropos of his own Guitarero, \u201cWhen I was painting this figure, I was thinking about the Madrid masters and about Hals as well. You know, I can\u2019t believe that Franz [sic] Hals wasn\u2019t in fact a Spaniard.\u201d (En peignant cette figure, je pensais aux ma\u00eetres de Madrid et aussi \u00e0 Hals. Tu sais, on ne m\u2019\u00f4tera pas de la t\u00eate que Franz [sic] Hals \u00e9tait de race espagnole). See Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet par lui-m\u00eame (\u00c9ditions Atlas, 1991), p. 29. For the English translation, see Juliet Wilson-Bareau, ed., Manet by Himself: Correspondence and Conversation, Paintings, Pastels, Prints and Drawings (Macdonald &amp; Co., 1991), p. 29.\n\nThe drastic change in price, too, might reflect reworking of the canvas between 1872 and 1875. Juliet Wilson-Bareau discovered a record of this previously unknown sale in 1989, a transcription by L\u00e9on Leenhoff of a page from Manet\u2019s account book, enclosed in a privately held notebook. See Juliet Wilson-Bareau, \u201cL\u2019Ann\u00e9e impressionniste de Manet: Argenteuil et Venise en 1874,\u201d Revue de l\u2019art 86 (Fall/Winter 1989), pp. 31, 34 n. 18. An autograph letter (\u00c9douard Manet to Zacharie Astruc, November 7, 1875) corroborates the sale: \u201cMy dear friend, I was so happy to receive your letter. One must not neglect one\u2019s friends for so long. I wish and hope your journey will be as productive as possible. As for me, the year which began so badly seems as though it may end quite well. I have nothing to complain of. Besides that, I\u2019ve just sold to M. Debrousse, and for a quite respectable price, the portrait of Desboutin and the Little Water Drinker. Two days ago, I saw your wife pass by my window; I hailed her down and told her that I\u2019d received a letter from you in which you\u2019d told me you regretted your absence. She seemed delighted, which is perfectly natural. Aside from that, still the same routine, each of us pursues his own business and succeeding more or less. Until soon, yours, Edouard Manet.\u201d (Mon cher ami, ta lettre m\u2019a fait grand plaisir. Il ne faut pas oublier si longtemps les amis. Je d\u00e9sire et j\u2019esp\u00e8re que ton voyage soit le plus productif possible. Quant \u00e0 moi, l\u2019ann\u00e9e qui avait bien mal commenc\u00e9e semble devoir tr\u00e8s bien finir. Je n\u2019ai pas \u00e0 me plaindre. Je viens en outre de vendre \u00e0 M. Debrousse et \u00e0 un prix fort honorable, le portrait de Desboutin et le Petit Buveur d\u2019eau. Il y a deux jours, j\u2019ai vu passer devant ma fen\u00eatre ta femme, je l\u2019ai h\u00e9l\u00e9 et lui ai dit que j\u2019avais re\u00e7u une lettre de toi dans laquelle tu me disais les regrets de l\u2019absence. Elle a paru enchant\u00e9e, ce qui est tout naturel. En dehors de cela, toujours la m\u00eame routine, chacun cherche \u00e0 faire sa petite affaire et y r\u00e9ussit plus ou moins. A bient\u00f4t et \u00e0 toi. Edouard Manet.) [emphasis mine]. This letter belongs to the Librairie Traces Ecrites, Paris (inv. no 10174). I wish to thank Emmanuel Lorient for bringing it to my attention.\n\nFor Debrousse, see Atsushi Miura, \u201cLe portrait de M. Desboutin par Manet et le probl\u00e8me de la repr\u00e9sentation de l\u2019artiste,\u201d Mediterraneus: Annual Report of the Collegium Mediterranistarum, no. 12 (1989), pp. 101\u00ad\u201329.\n\nSee the catalogue of his posthumous sale (in which, however, no Manets appear): Collection de feu M. Hubert Debrousse, catalogue des tableaux modernes, aquarelles, dessins et pastels, sale cat. (Galerie Georges Petit, April 4\u20136, 1900). The Ribots are lots 148\u201394.\n\nThe other picture Debrousse acquired from Manet in September 1875 was a recent portrait of the painter and printmaker Marcellin Desboutin, titled The Artist (1875; Museu de Arte Moderna, S\u00e3o Paulo [RW I 244]). A member of Manet\u2019s circle at the Caf\u00e9 Guerbois and the Nouvelle Ath\u00e8nes, Desboutin belonged by 1875 to the beleaguered Impressionist avant-garde. (For more on Desboutin, see Bernard Duplaix, Marcellin Desboutin, prince des Boh\u00e8mes [Les Imprimeries Re\u0301unies, 1985]). \u201cI cannot pretend to have summed up an epoch,\u201d Proust reports that Manet said of the work, \u201cbut simply to have painted the most extraordinary \u2018type\u2019 of a particular quarter. I painted Desboutin with as much passion as Baudelaire.\u201d The original French reads \u201cJe n\u2019ai pas eu la pr\u00e9tention d\u2019avoir r\u00e9sum\u00e9 une \u00e9poque, mais d\u2019avoir peint le type le plus extraordinaire d\u2019un quartier. J\u2019ai peint Desboutin avec autant de passion que Baudelaire.\u201d See Antonin Proust, \u201cEdouard Manet. Souvenirs,\u201d La revue blanche 12 (Jan. 1897), p. 203). As the \u201ctype le plus extraordinaire\u201d of the Batignolles neighborhood, a Baudelairean artist at the margins of polite society, Desboutin represented a new brand of \u201cbohemian,\u201d an art gypsy, and a neighbor of Manet\u2019s humble Boy with Pitcher, with which the monumental portrait shared its first home.\n\nThere are two other surviving fragments from the original canvas: Still Life with a Basket and Onions or Garlic and Le Boh\u00e8me, both at the Louvre Abu Dhabi (see Curatorial Entry).\n\nWhen the painting was lined in 1968, the tacking margins were flattened and the canvas was stretched on a larger stretcher to show all of the original canvas on one plane. The brown background was also extended onto the top and left tacking margins (see Conservation History).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, suggests that the paint mixture for the signature contains burnt umber and bone black. Lead white, cobalt blue, and zinc compounds were also detected in spectra collected from the signature area. Other pigments may also be present. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_BoyPitcher\\_1968\\_303\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Jan. 31, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe canvas fibers were not analyzed.\n\nSee Anne Coffin Hanson, \u201c\u00c9douard Manet, \u2018Les Gitanos\u2019, and the Cut Canvas,\u201d Burlington Magazine 112, 804 (Mar. 1970), pp. 158, 160\u2013167; and Curatorial Entry.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nIn The Art of Impressionism: Painting Technique and the Making of Modernity (Yale University Press, 2000), p. 39, Anthea Callen notes that instances of Manet\u2019s use of twill-weave canvas are limited. The small version of Luncheon on the Grass (c. 1862\u201363; Courtauld Institute of Art, [RW I 66]) is on a twill canvas: \u201ca fine weave whose grainy texture is revealed by the priming, despite the cream self-priming over a first layer of commercial preparation.\u201d\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: \u00c9douard Manet, Boy with Pitcher (La R\u00e9galade) (RW43/1968.303),\u201d Jan. 2014.\n\nA second set of holes closer to the edge of the canvas on the left tacking margin could be related to the tacking of the larger painting.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination and treatment report, Nov. 22, 1968, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe layer structure and thickness of the ground could not be determined because only a partial ground layer was captured in the samples taken.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. Microscopically, some reddish-brown particles were observed and XRF analysis of the ground detected traces of iron, which suggests the presence of trace amounts of iron oxide-containing pigments. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Kimberley Muir, \u201cManet\\_Boy\\_1968\\_303\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d January 31, 2017; and Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_BoyPitcher\\_1968\\_303\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d January 31, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nExposed ridges in the brushwork of the woman\u2019s flesh and the presence of retouching in this area indicate that some abrasion of the boy\u2019s shirt has occurred. See Conservation History.\n\nThese edges, along with the unpainted left edge, served as the tacking margins for the cropped composition and, thus, were not covered by the dark-brown background paint applied by Manet. However, when the painting was lined in 1968, the tacking margins were flattened and the canvas was re-stretched flat on a larger stretcher so that the original canvas is all in one plane with no folded-over edges. At this time, the dark-brown background was extended over the left and top tacking margins\u2014the row of tack holes and the foldover creases are visible through the brown paint on both edges\u2014so that the background was extended approximately 1.5 cm on those edges; i.e., the composition was originally cropped closer to the edges of the pitcher on the top and left sides (see Conservation History). The extreme left and top edges that are not covered with brown paint correspond to the excess fabric that was folded over the back face of the stretcher in the original stretching of the cropped composition.\n\nThe variable surface of the sky appears to be similar to the sky in the fragment that contains the male gypsy\u2014Le Boh\u00e8me, at the Louvre Abu Dhabi (see fig. 14.3 in the curatorial entry).\n\nTraces of zinc and chromium were detected in some areas, which may indicate the presence of other pigments, such as zinc white, chrome yellow or viridian, but further analysis would be required to confirm this. XRF analysis was carried out in air. XRF does not detect organic pigments, if present, and has low sensitivity for elements like silicon and sodium (a component of ultramarine blue). Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. See Federica Pozzi, \u201cMan\\_BoyPitcher\\_1968\\_303\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Jan. 31, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Manet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Manet paintings in other collections. See, for example, David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 74.\n\nThe treatment report states that the tacking margins were \u201ccarefully flattened for the picture was to be made larger so that evidences of the former design, when the picture was part of a larger composition, could be more easily seen. A new stretcher was ordered for this larger size.\u201d Alfred Jakstas, examination and treatment report, Nov. 22, 1968, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination and treatment report, Nov. 22, 1968, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlfred Jakstas, examination and treatment report, Nov. 22, 1968, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Alfred Jakstas, examination report, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Don H.
