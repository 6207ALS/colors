Their differences point to his growing desire to experiment with his methodology as a watercolor painter. This sketch, possibly made from the Brooklyn Bridge, takes a view of the skyline similar to the other two, yet Marin transformed the small sheet into a kind of floating fantasy. He combined the fluid, improvisational technique of the Weehawken scenes with warm-cool color contrasts, a palette that he soon developed into the iridescent effects seen in his later watercolors.</p>\n",
