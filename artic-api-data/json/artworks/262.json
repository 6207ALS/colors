    "description": "<p>In the Roman world, portraits were often recarved in order to alter the sculpture\u2019s function, meaning, or identity. It is possible that this portrait head was altered at a later date because it includes features associated with different periods. The man\u2019s hairstyle, with locks of hair neatly arranged across the forehead, recalls those worn by men during the Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BC\u2013AD 68) and again during the reign of the emperor Trajan (reigned AD 98\u2013117). However, the drill marks in his large eyes were likely added at a later date, perhaps even centuries later, when the recarving of portraits became a much more common practice due to shortages of marble.</p>\n",
