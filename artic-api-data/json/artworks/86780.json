    "description": "<p>After studying in D\u00fcsseldorf and Paris, Julius Gari Melchers settled in Holland, where he was inspired by contemporary Dutch painters of the Hague School. He specialized in naturalistic depictions of peasant life, including this compassionate rendering of a Dutch woman and her child. Melchers portrayed the pair with vivid intensity, contrasting the mother\u2019s direct gaze with the charming appeal of the baby\u2019s chubby face. The rapid brushwork used to describe the clothing and the swaddling blanket contributes to the freshness of his depiction. In 1906 <em>Mother and Child</em> was exhibited at both the Paris Salon and the Art Institute.</p>\n",
