There can be little doubt that this image of a draped model standing against a rail is the \u201cuntried drawing no. 2\u201d described by Whistler\u2019s executrix.\n\nDraped Model, Standing was probably drawn in November or early December 1893, at the time when Whistler was experimenting with the stump on both transfer paper and stone. His letters to the Ways indicate that he had two or three drawings on stone that he wanted them to print (letter 53). He was concerned about the safety of posting the lithographic stones from Paris to London because of the potential for damage should they be improperly handled by customs inspectors. For this reason, he asked his friend William Heinemann to carry one stone from France to the Ways in London in mid-November (letter 53, letter 54, and letter 56). Unfortunately, when the stone was printed, the result (no examples of which have survived) proved to be, in Whistler\u2019s words, \u201ca dire failure\u201d (letter 58). The other stones mentioned in the correspondence were neither sent nor carried to the Ways. In all likelihood, this image was drawn on one of these remaining stones. It was set aside in the artist\u2019s Paris studio, and not printed until Goulding\u2019s posthumous edition of 1903.\n\nThe model is probably Carmen Rossi, the same young woman who posed for several other lithographs in late 1893 (see cat. 71, cat. 72, and cat. 73). The motif of a lightly draped model posing against a rail is one that Whistler treated repeatedly. In a lithograph of 1879, Study (cat. 19), he drew a static and patently classical version of the pose on a stone prepared with a half-tint ground. In Nude Model, Back View (cat. 45), one of the color lithographs he produced with Belfond in 1891, Whistler depicted a draped figure bent over a railing. When he drew The Draped Model, Standing,he was probably seeking to reproduce the evanescent effects he could create with pastel and stumps on brown paper, such as those achieved in Blue and Violet (fig. 74a [M 1221]), a pastel of 1888/89 now in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow. The stump allowed him to capture more subtle, sensuous effects of modeling and transparency than he had been able to achieve in the earlier lithographs.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream laid paper (262 \u00d7 190 mm).
