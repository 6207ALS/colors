    "transcript": "<p>Annelise Madsen: &quot;La Carmencita&quot; is a portrait by Sargent of a Spanish dancer named Carmen Dauset, who traveled to New York in 1890 on a dancing tour. I'm Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. Sargent and his peers were captivated by La Carmencita in part because of the way she danced and the dramatic nature of her movements.</p>\n<p>In the end, in this portrait, he doesn't show her in the midst of dancing. She's standing upright with one foot extended, meeting our gaze, perhaps the moment before she begins a performance. So you get that sense of anticipation in this composition. When this painting was on view in Chicago, it attracted crowds of visitors and the reason behind this is probably because the painting was bold, it was challenging. For Sargent, it is a demonstration piece of sorts in the way that he is able to marry his understanding and his learning from art of the past, from the old masters, and also giving us a taste of a more progressive kind of painting.</p>\n<p>And audiences responded, critics too, both positively and negatively. The report for the Inter Ocean, for example, had been quite harsh when he first reviewed the painting, but then, he reassessed later on. &quot;Mr. Sargent's 'La Carmencita' is a popular success, strong in some things, bold, but not free from trickery. Those critics who have condemned it offhand and rail at Mr. Sargent as a trickster do have a partial injustice at least. It is not as good as some would have us believe, nor as bad as the railers insist it is.&quot;</p>\n",
