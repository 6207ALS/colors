    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: We now stand in front of a bodhisattva, in Japanese, a bosatsu from the Nara period.  It was made sometime in the late 8th Century and was probably once part of a larger group of deity figures.  The bodhisattva still wears the decorative trappings of the material world like jewelry and elaborate robes unlike the Buddha who has given up such things.  His hands with thumbs and index fingers touching are in a gesture of teaching.  The bodhisattva chose to remain among us after achieving enlightenment in order to help the rest of us pursue our spiritual liberation.  It was during the Nara period that Buddhism initially flowered in Japan and the city of Nara was its center.  Gathered in Nara were the greatest artists of the time and the quality of this sculpture is exceptional, it's carved from many pieces of wood over which the sculptor layered lacquer and gold leaf.  It's a very beautiful object even though or perhaps because the original gold color has been blackened by soot from countless prayer candles.  This is one of those very, very rare examples, one of three we think of Nara school sculpture in the United States. And it's interesting to note that the flowering of Buddhist art in Nara Japan was simultaneous with the achievement of Tang culture in China.  If you go look at the enormous Tang Chinese stone Buddha in the main hall outside this gallery, you can compare the two. The obvious difference is in scale, the monumentality of the Chinese versus the intimacy of the Japanese.  But there is an eloquence and an elegance that unites them.</p>\n",
