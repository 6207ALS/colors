Nearly all of the works within this remarkable volume\u2014many of them never published before\u2014have been drawn from North American collections. This catalogue accompanies the first exhibition to celebrate the Irish as artists, collectors, and patrons over 150 years of Ireland's sometimes turbulent history.
