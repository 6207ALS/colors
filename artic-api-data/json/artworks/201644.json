    "description": "<p>Discouraged by the uniformity of approaches to sofa design, designer Konstantin Grcic created Chaos. As its name suggests, rather than encouraging users to sit comfortably, Chaos triggers a sense of unease. Although the chair is actually stable, its compact, angular form appears to balance precariously on a thin metal stand, giving the impression that it will tip over if sat on and thus encouraging users to perch rather than recline. As Grcic attested, this is the point: \u201cWhen I am sitting in front of someone or in a public space, I am more comfortable sitting on the edge of a chair and leaning into a conversation rather than lounging back in my seat.\u201d Envisioned for use in public spaces such as lobbies or waiting rooms, the chair\u2019s forked silhouette was determined by tracing a variety of seating positions into the lines of the design.</p>\n",
