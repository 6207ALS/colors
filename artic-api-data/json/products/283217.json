This publication from Vienna\u2019s Kunsthistorisches Museum commemorates the 500th anniversary of Maximilian\u2019s death, combining for the first time\u00a0all 255 gold- and silver-heightened miniatures\u00a0with an introductory essay and explanatory texts.\u00a0From 1512 to 1515, Maximilian commissioned a\u00a0massive, exquisitely detailed and illustrated manuscript of the 64 tournaments. The 255 elaborately gilt and silvered miniatures were more than just a collection of jousting scenes from the Habsburg court\u2014from the grand melee and tilting at the lists to foot combat and closing ceremonies\u2014they were\u00a0an allegorical epic telling the story of an intrepid hero, a knight errant who is no other than Maximilian himself. In the guise of his literary alter ego \u201cFreydal\u201d, the Emperor jousted to prove his love for a noble lady. The story ends with the lady agreeing to marry him\u2014she is no other than Mary of Burgundy, whom Maximilian wed in 1477 at Ghent.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Hardcover\u00a0</p><p>Pages:\u00a0 448</p><p>Product Dimensions:\u00a0 14.2 in. x 14.2 in.\u00a0</p><p>Item Weight:\u00a0 12.20 lbs\u00a0</p>",
