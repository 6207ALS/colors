    "description": "<p>Auguste Rodin\u2019s powerfully expressive figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve, flanking a sculptured bronze portal commissioned by the French government for the Mus\u00e9e de Arts D\u00e9coratifs, Paris. For this monumental undertaking, which he entitled <em>The Gates of Hell</em>, Rodin turned to past Italian masters. Michelangelo\u2019s <em>Creation of Adam</em> fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508\u201312) inspired the pose of Rodin\u2019s subject. Rodin rotated Michelangelo\u2019s reclining Adam and transferred the frescoed figure\u2019s gesture of receiving life from God to the sculpture\u2019s right arm. The exaggerated turn of Adam\u2019s left arm comes from Michelangelo\u2019s sculpture of the dead Christ in his <em>Piet\u00e0</em> (1548\u201355; Museo del Duomo, Florence). Rodin chose the portal\u2019s theme from Dante\u2019s fourteenth-century epic poem <em>Inferno</em>; here Adam\u2019s agonized body strikingly conveys the sufferings caused by original sin. Although the museum building was never constructed and the portal was not completed as originally conceived, Rodin explored the expressive potential of the human body as few artists before him had dared. As independent statues, Adam and Eve are among the commission\u2019s numerous progeny. Not until 1938 was the gate cast in bronze and placed at the entrance to the grounds of the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, Paris.</p>\n",
