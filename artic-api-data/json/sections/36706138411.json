Harrison Collection, 1933.895\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet created Caricature of a Man with a Large Nose with soft graphite on a slightly textured, greenish-brown wove paper, utilizing most of the sheet. From the layout of the composition, it appears that he worked out the figure with light, quick strokes of graphite, followed by darker, broader lines to more fully establish the form. The side of the graphite was used to carefully model the man\u2019s face and create broad passages of tone in his hat and hair. Shadows were established in the figure\u2019s body using dark, thick strokes of graphite.\n\nGreenish-brown, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nUniform with a few fiber inclusions.\n\nEven.\n\nThe edges are all trimmed irregularly. The bottom edge has several paper slivers from when cuts were started and then stopped.\n\n248 \u00d7 152 mm\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence overall on the paper surface that is characteristic of a light gelatin surface sizing.\n\nThe composition was drawn using the dull tip of a soft graphite pencil to establish the outline and the form of the figure. The artist first quickly sketched in the forms with light graphite lines, and then he selectively reinforced them with darker, thicker strokes. Tonal effects in the face were created utilizing the side of the graphite with light pressure to fill in the broad areas of shading and modeling. There is a slight indentation in the paper support where the artist applied more pressure with his stroke to define the outline of the hat and the tip of the nose. The tonal effects of the body and shadow cast by the body were created with diagonal lines drawn with the side of the graphite in a back-and-forth motion. Monet further detailed the caricature by adding a pattern to the pants with simple perpendicular lines.\n\nThe composition was drawn directly onto the paper support. There is minor reworking of the figure\u2019s head at the nose and near the proper right eye (fig. 8.1). The artist changed the location of the proper right eye and angled the forehead back to make the head slightly smaller. With magnification there is no evidence of erasure or rubbing in the area of alteration. The artist\u2019s initial sketch was so faint that it did not affect the final rendering.\n\nThe bridge of the sitter\u2019s nose was slightly elevated and exaggerated. The initial outline can be seen below this area of shading. The revision may have occurred late in the drawing stage because the line is dark, which suggests that the artist had been content with the initial sketch, causing him to reinforce the newer line with a longer darker stroke (fig. 8.2). Monet may have applied more shading than initially intended in order to hide the dark line of his preliminary sketch.\n\nNo fixatives or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing is in very good condition. There is light surface soiling and discoloration overall. There are stray graphite markings along the top edge and at the lower right corner. Discoloration from light exposure is visible throughout except along the very edges of the sheet, where it was protected from the light by a former window mat. A faint brown mat burn line is visible along the right and lower edges. There are several brown foxing spots throughout the sheet on the recto and verso. With UV-induced visible fluorescence, hundreds of foxing spots that are not visible in normal conditions fluoresce yellow. There is a vertical, incised line 70 mm long running through the figure\u2019s jacket and legs. The lower left and right corners have strong diagonal creases. The edges are all trimmed irregularly. The bottom edge has several paper slivers. On the verso, at the center left edge, the paper tone is lighter, with paper abrasion and thinning.\n\nThe drawing was treated in 2005 to reduce the appearance of the foxing spots on the recto.  \nDawn Jaros\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Alfred Dussueil (1878\u20131927), Paris.\n\nSold by Henri Cottereau, Paris, to Carter H.

D492 (ill.) vol. 5, and p. 144, cat. D490 (ill.). Also according to the Durand-Ruel Archives, \u201cAlfred Dussueil (174 boulevard Pereire) deposited at Durand-Ruel Paris seven 7 [sic] drawings \u2018Portraits charge\u2019 on 2nd February 1927, which were returned to him on 14th March 1927. However, we have no further information (no image, no dimensions); thus no possibility of identifying these drawings.\u201d See Flavie Durand-Ruel, Durand-Ruel Archives, to the Art Institute of Chicago, Apr. 9, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. In short, of the ten caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, it is impossible to determine which seven were previously owned by Dussueil.\n\nNevertheless, scholar G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre has confirmed that Alfred Dussueil was the second son of Le Havre collector Georges Dussueil (1848\u20131926). See G\u00e9raldine Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Feb. 3, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Georges was a collector of modern art and a supporter of the Mus\u00e9e Malraux in Le Havre. In addition, Lefebvre reviewed the documents for the estate of Alfred Dussueil dated 1929 and found no mention of works of art, thereby supporting Wildenstein\u2019s assertion. See Lefebvre to the Art Institute of Chicago, Mar. 31, 2014, curatorial object file, Art Institute of Chicago. Finally, the Caricature of Mario Uchard (cat. 5 [D499]) has a mostly illegible graphite inscription on the verso in the lower right, which might be \u201cAl Dussueil\u201d (see cat. 5; Inscriptions and Distinguishing Marks). It is therefore possible that, like a number of other caricatures in the Art Institute\u2019s collection, this drawing was once owned by Georges Dussueil, passed to his son upon his death in 1926, and was sold to Henri Cottereau at some point between March 14 and November 3, 1927. The number preceded by a D refers to drawings in the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Wildenstein, Claude Monet, vol. 5.\n\nAccording to Carter H.
