    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: If you have an impulse to move the blue curtain further to one side, please resist it, it's actually a painting of a silk curtain by Dutch artist, Franz van Mieris.  Realistically executed in a style known in French as trompe l'oeil or fool the eye.  The curtain if it had been real would have been used in the 17th Century to protect the painting from dust and soot.  Another subtler trick is the choice of flowers painted by a second artist Adriaen von de Velde.  Here's Larry Fineberg.</p>\n<p>LARRY FINEBERG: To some degree this painting is an example of conspicuous consumption, it's a complete fantasy because it combines flowers not only from various places but also flowers that did not bloom at the same time of year.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Because of Holland's lucrative maritime trade, the wealthier Dutch could acquire flowers from the East.  Look at the red and white tulip in the lower right hand corner.  Although this flower is closely associated with Holland today, tulips were originally imported from Persia.</p>\n",
