    "copy": " A bold, theoretical look at an emerging generation of architects, this volume is devoted to five contemporary practices\u2014Bureau Spectacular, Erin Besler, Fake Industries Architectural Agonism, Formlessfinder, and John Szot Studio\u2014and the diverse methods and approaches that drive their work. Chatter , whose title refers to the disjointed bits of conversation typified by texting and Twitter, examines how contemporary modes of communication have influenced the construction of ideas in the development, production, and presentation of architecture.   Karen Kice surveys the evolution of architecture and illuminates how these architects have developed their work in conversation with historical theories and projects. Using a range of representational methods and formats to explore ideas\u2014from hand- and robot-made drawings, to graphic novels, to digital simulations\u2014these practitioners embrace contemporary technologies while they engage with history. Kice\u2019s essay, accompanied by portfolios of works from each studio, deftly elucidates how these practitioners talk back to the past while conceiving and communicating their unique designs.
