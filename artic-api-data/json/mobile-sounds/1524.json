    "transcript": "<p>BRANDON RUDE:  This was not only the first sculpture Frederic Remington ever made, but it was also the first heroic cowboy sculpture of its kind.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Brandon Rude, Curator in the American Art Department.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE:  Frederic Remington was best known during his lifetime as a painter and an illustrator. In 1892 he published a pen and ink drawing of a cowboy on a rearing horse, and this drawing served as the basis for the later Bronco Buster sculpture that you see here. In 1895 on the eve of producing Bronco Buster, Remington crowed, &quot;Did I tell you that I was about to become a great sculptor? If not, well damn my modesty, it is so.&quot;</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Remington was certainly a show-off, but he had good reason.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE:  This is a complicate piece to produce, especially for somebody's first effort. Notice for example how the horse stands only on its two hind legs, and thus supports the very top-heavy cowboy and the front of the horse as it curves over.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  It's important to keep in mind that this sculpture was made in the late 1800s.</p>\n<p>BRANDON RUDE: Remington worked at a time, and produced this piece, when America was becoming increasingly<br>nostalgic over the West. So what Remington is serving up is a romanticized, nostalgic view of the American cowboy and the American West.</p>\n",
