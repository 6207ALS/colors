Seated cross-legged in a rocking chair, the model turns her head toward the viewer, her nonchalant gaze cast down. The description of her features is cursory, their reiterated contours inexact despite the use of pencil around the eye sockets, lids, and collar. The treatment of the woman\u2019s body, meanwhile, is spare. Drawn in charcoal, its profile is distinct, but the modeling of the dress is minimal. The sitter\u2019s right arm, bent at the elbow to rest across her stomach, fades into the barest suggestion of a hand. The soft, remaining marks give the impression that the medium was somehow transferred onto the page rather than applied directly. Aside from an area of shading to the right of the woman's face, and a few strokes that extend parallel to the nape of her neck, the background is empty, providing little sense of context.\n\nThe model is dressed in contemporary clothing, which indicates that the work was produced before Renoir changed his style\u2014and, to a degree, his values\u2014in the mid-1880s. One of the first pictures he had shown with the Impressionist group in 1874, The Parisienne (fig. 18.1 [Daulte 102; Dauberville 299]), delights in the sitter\u2019s elaborate costume, and he produced several other images of modern women in the following years. Although the clothes are not described in detail in the present image, they do place the sitter in a metropolitan environment. From the middle of the decade onward, Renoir tended to avoid details that were specifically contemporary, possibly in reaction to female emancipation.\n\nThe artist seems to have taken as much pleasure in describing the chair as he did its occupant. Arabesques form its sides, curling up at either end in satisfying curves. A searching line on the level of the rockers suggests a shadow below, conveying a sense of movement, as if prompted by the blurred (and so presumably agitated) feet.\n\nTechnical examination of the sheet by Art Institute paper conservator Kimberly Nichols revealed another Renoir drawing on its verso (see Technical Report). Akin to the Buste de danseuse of around 1883\u201385 (fig. 18.2 [Dauberville 1446]), this second image shows the torso of a seated female figure, seen from behind, in a state of partial undress (fig. 18.3), quite unlike the Woman Seated in a Chair. Renoir seems to have drawn the model\u2019s profil perdu with a single gesture, and the twisted knot of her hair and gentle slope of the shoulders are described in clear, delicate lines. This image may relate to the series of bather drawings that the artist made in the mid-1880s, but, despite its visual appeal, he did not complete the work. Perhaps the suggestion of clothing tied the figure too closely to contemporary life at a moment when Renoir more often sought to create figures that harked back to antiquity.  \nNancy Ireson\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir executed Woman Seated in a Chair primarily in charcoal on ivory, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper. Soft charcoal lines and broad areas of shading loosely define the figure\u2019s body and the rocking chair. The slight texture of the paper surface is revealed in the broadly drawn passages. The figure\u2019s hair is the most modeled part of the composition; here Renoir used both charcoal and graphite with touches of stumping or erasure to achieve further tonal variation (fig. 18.4). In contrast, the figure\u2019s face and neck sash are carefully defined with hard graphite lines. Erasure may also have been used to further emphasize the placement of the figure\u2019s hands in her lap. The seated woman fills the center area of the paper support, and there is little development of the background: only a faint shaded area to the right of the face and a straight horizontal line across the lower area of the sheet suggest a sense of space.\n\nOn the verso, a faint unfinished graphite sketch depicts the upper half of a woman, viewed from behind, with her hair in a bun and a towel or shawl draped loosely around her back (fig. 18.5). The image is most clearly seen with the aid of infrared reflectography (fig. 18.6).\n\nStamp: Renoir. (lower right, in brown-black ink) (fig. 18.7).\n\nIvory, moderately thick, slightly textured wove paper.\n\nJ. Whatman, Turkey Mill, 1881 (complete, horizontal orientation across top of sheet) (fig. 18.8).\n\nUniform, without visible inclusions or colored fibers.\n\nEven.\n\nA deckle edge is preserved along the top of the sheet. The side edges appear to be edge-torn, exhibiting slight irregularities, and the bottom edge is trimmed straight.\n\n362 \u00d7 310 mm.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions or under magnification. Under UV illumination, there is a pale-yellow visible-light fluorescence that is characteristic of a light gelatin sizing.\n\nThe work is drawn in charcoal, with selective use of graphite to define the upper portion of the figure, including the hair, face, and clothing around the neck. There appear to be touches of stumping or erasure, which create tonal variation in the figure\u2019s hair. Erasure may also have been used to selectively highlight the figure\u2019s hands, crossed in her lap.\n\nOn the verso, a faint graphite drawing depicts the upper half of a woman, viewed from behind, with her hair in a bun and a towel or shawl draped loosely around her back.\n\nNo revisions or changes are visible in the composition in normal conditions or under magnification.\n\nNo artistic surface alterations or coatings are visible in normal conditions, under UV illumination, or under magnification.\n\nThe drawing support exhibits soft undulations around the perimeter of the sheet. There is small tear at the center top edge. Traces of adhesive residue and staining are faintly visible along the left edge. The charcoal medium appears sunk in and lightly smudged in some areas. The verso of the drawing exhibits small thinned areas, most concentrated on the lower right, and small spots of brown material that suggest former removal of the drawing from a mount.\n\nUnder UV illumination, the drawing support reveals several large, irregularly ringed areas of bright-yellow visible-light fluorescence adjacent to slightly UV-absorbing areas in the upper third of the drawing support. It is likely that these areas correspond to former contact with moisture or liquid that caused movement of components in the paper, including the gelatin sizing. It is likely that staining developed in these areas but was formerly reduced through conservation treatment; under normal conditions traces of the staining are currently visible only in the upper right area of the sheet.  \nKimberly Nichols\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Estate of the artist, from 1919.\n\nSold by the artist\u2019s estate to Andr\u00e9 Schoeller: Paris.\n\nAndr\u00e9 Schoeller, probably to at least July 27, 1939.\n\nSold by Justin K.
