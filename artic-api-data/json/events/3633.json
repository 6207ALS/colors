    "description": "<p>Henry Taylor (born 1958) is a Los Angeles\u2013based artist whose work explores the intersection of race and urban life through vibrant palettes, playful compositions, and intimate portraiture. While he is most known for his acrylic paintings, his work often questions the accessibility of the medium itself, and thus expands into a sculptural realm, using found objects such as milk cartons and cigarettes. Recently, Taylor\u2019s narrative paintings on family history, the cotton industry, and modern police brutality were featured at the 2017 Whitney Biennial.</p><p>Presented by the <a href=\"/join-and-give/affiliate-groups/society-contemporary-art\">Society for Contemporary Art</a></p>",
