In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 54.1, fig. 54.2, and fig. 54.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the yellow walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa Suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in circa 1894 by his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices (see fig. 54.4) for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin (see cat. 54.1, cat. 54.2, and cat. 54.3) and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. The analysis that follows of what the print depicts relies on a 1921 impression (cat. 54.4), which conveys all of the information that Gauguin inscribed and carved into the wood block. Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance.\u201d\n\nTo understand the Tahitians\u2019 ancient religion, which had been virtually eradicated by nearly a century of Christian missionary work, Gauguin depended on historical publications. He was especially indebted to Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout\u2019s 1837 Voyage aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an, selecting passages of this text that he would copy into various manuscripts. Unlike the first three Noa Noa plates (cat. 51, cat. 52, and cat. 53), which derive from the Tahitian paintings and sculptures in Gauguin\u2019s Paris studio, the source for the fourth print in the Noa Noa Suite, L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created), is found in one of his manuscripts, Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion) (see figs. 54.11, 54.14, 54.17), executed in Tahiti in 1892/93.\n\nThe print\u2019s title derives from the last line of the so-called Tahitian Chant of Creation, included in Moerenhout\u2019s account of his voyages to Polynesia: \u201cLes cieux tournent; les cieux se sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s; la mer remplit ses profondeurs; l\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9\u201d (The skies turn; the skies are raised; the sea fills its depths; the universe is created). Gauguin based his illustration of the creation myth on Moerenhout as well. The composition and iconographic program of this print derive from individual watercolors in Ancien culte mahorie\u2014each corresponding to Polynesian myths related by the Belgian explorer-ethnographer\u2014that Gauguin amalgamated into a single image.\n\nThe composition of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9e divides into three areas, designating the realm of gods and spirits, the earth, and the sea. The first of these, at the right, is the heart-shaped oyster shell (see fig. 54.5) from which the Tahitians believed the universe originated and which is the attribute of Ta\u2019aroa (see fig. 54.6 [Gray 89]), the creator god of the Polynesian universe and supreme deity. Within the shell is the god\u2019s masklike head, accompanied by spirits, or ti\u2019ii, in the form of fish-like creatures, his sons from a tryst with Hina, goddess of the moon. While the forms Gauguin created for the ti\u2019ii; can be related to water-dwelling creatures\u2014possibly a curling, eel-like shape (see fig. 54.7) in the shell\u2019s upper-right section; a large, skeletal, fish-like head to the left of Ta\u2019aroa (see fig. 54.8); and a fish with three dark fins (see fig. 54.9) below the creator god\u2014they are mysterious, even monstrous in appearance. While it is impossible to determine his sources, they could range from images he saw in the illustrated press or in natural history museums to forays through neighborhood fish markets or even an uneaten fish head on his dinner plate. Fronds of kelp (see fig. 54.10) emerge at the upper left of the shell and near one of the ti\u2019ii. This section is a direct quote from the watercolor in Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 54.11), below which Gauguin transcribed a text from Moerenhout on Polynesian spirits. A variation on this scene is found in another watercolor, in Gauguin\u2019s bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 54.12). Finally, the motif appears at the right of a watercolor on silk entitled Musique barbare (Barbaric Music) (fig. 54.13 [Rewald 83, Pickvance XVI]).\n\nA line undulating across the composition indicates a coastline. To the left of the shell, cresting waves roll to shore. In the upper-left corner, three people, depicted from the waist up, seem to flounder as if struggling not to be subsumed by water. In the left foreground two figures watch the roiling sea from a safe place on land. They can be related to an episode from the legend of Roua hatou, a minor divinity, which Gauguin interpreted here somewhat loosely. Raoua hatou, whom Moerenhout likened to Neptune, was asleep at the bottom of the sea when the hook from a fisherman\u2019s line became entangled in his hair and woke him. Much angered, he decided to unleash a flood that would destroy humankind. However, he allowed the fisherman and his family to survive the flood on a high mountain; thus saved, they went on to repopulate the earth. The two figures are identical to a pair depicted in another watercolor in Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 54.14), although reversed by the printing process, where Gauguin included the story as told by Moerenhaut. The artist reprised the theme on another page of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 54.15).\n\nThe left foreground of the earthly realm contains the title of the print; Gauguin\u2019s monogram, PGO, appears on the opposite side. The unfinished, wispy appearance of its surround suggests that the artist might have considered developing a design idea for it that he then abandoned. In the center foreground, Gauguin depicted rather freely the striking threadfin butterflyfish, found in Polynesian waters (see fig. 54.16). A lotus flower and stem appears to issue from its mouth. Behind the fish strides a small figure, in profile and extending one arm forward. This image replicates another watercolor in Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 54.17) that includes a text about lesser deities in the Polynesian pantheon entitled Atouas (inf\u00e9rieurs) (Minor Gods).\n\nThe walking figure and fish with a lotus blossom in its mouth are found in Egyptian art. Prototypes of the former are visible in photographs that Gauguin took with him to Tahiti of frescoes from the tomb of Nebamun at Thebes in the British Museum, London (see fig. 54.18). While he never actually saw the brilliantly colored fresco in London, he could easily have viewed similarly hued ones on visits to the vast Egyptian collections at the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris.\n\nThe fish-and-lotus motif\u2014which for Egyptians symbolized fertility and rebirth, a fact that Gauguin may have known, although this is not documented\u2014is often found in the wall decorations of ancient Egyptian tombs. Gauguin\u2019s version is very similar to one such relief in the Glyptotek, Copenhagen (see fig. 54.19), although he substituted a Polynesian fish for the Nile tilapia depicted by the Egyptians. The motif is not found among the photographs of Egyptian art that Gauguin had in Tahiti, but he could have encountered it in museums or in reproduction.\n\nGauguin greatly appreciated the patterns and beauty of exotic fish. Among the surviving works by him in which they feature (albeit not the same type of fish as in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9) are a carved polychrome relief decorating a circa 1892 wood umete\u2014a dish for cooked and pounded breadfruit (popoi) (fig. 54.20 [Gray 103])\u2014and the front end-sheet of the 1893 manuscript Cahier pour Aline (Notebook for Aline) (fig. 54.21). Identical in design but different because of the media in which they were executed, both decorations feature the dwarf/lemonpeel angelfish (see fig. 54.22 and fig. 54.23), along with a mustache triggerfish (see fig. 54.24 and fig. 54.25). The verso of an undated sheet features an angelfish (fig. 54.26).\n\nThe fish with a lotus branch and striding companion appear on the suede front cover of Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti (fig. 54.27). While it is hard to decipher, given the compromised condition of the leather, that the motif graced the front of a manuscript in which Gauguin was so deeply invested signals its importance to him.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">The title of this print, inscribed along the lower edge of the plate, is a quotation from the account of the Polynesian cosmogenesis given by Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout in his 1837 Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an. It is the only title in the Noa Noa Suite that is in French rather than in Tahitian and means literally \u201cThe universe is created.\u201d Moerenhout provided a transcription of the original \u201cchant,\u201d a literal translation of the verses, and a running, freer translation, which Gauguin preferred in this case. He could have used Moerenhout\u2019s Tahitian version, \u00e9pau f\u00e9noua no hoa\u00efi, or the literal translation, est achev\u00e9e la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019univers (\u201cthe creation of the universe is completed\u201d), which would have clarified the stage of creation concerned. As it is, the title can also be understood as meaning \u201cThe universe is being created,\u201d that is, as referring to an ongoing process, and the choice of French over Tahitian suggests that Gauguin wanted his public to have direct access to the theme of his work.\n\nWhile in Tahiti, Gauguin copied the passages of Moerenhout\u2019s book pertaining to religion and mythology into his illustrated 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion). The story of the creation of the world is followed there by an image of the creator god Ta\u2019aroa sitting on top of a sphere (presumably the Earth), surrounded by dots representing the stars, with an air of concentration and an erect penis (fig. 54.28). Although L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 derives from Ancien culte mahorie, rather than from paintings or sculptures like the other plates of the Noa Noa Suite, it does not incorporate this image of Ta\u2019aroa \u201cturning himself into the universe.\u201d Instead, it combines illustrations made by Gauguin for three other passages from Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an, two about the creation of the gods, specifically the lower categories of the \u201cinferior atuas\u201d (fig. 54.29) and the ti\u2019ii (fig. 54.30), and the third one about a legend that Moerenhout compared to the biblical deluge (fig. 54.31).\n\nThe relation of these three episodes to the cosmogenesis and to one another is not clear, so that their interpretation\u2014unless one assumes a more or less haphazard reuse and combination of motifs on Gauguin\u2019s part\u2014requires a close look at their formal treatment and their integration into the print. A common denominator of the three illustrations is their connection with the sea, and their motifs are assembled in the print against the background of a landscape with water above and land below, separated by a convex shore. The sea is obviously of crucial importance for the practical and imaginary life of people living on islands in the Pacific, but L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 is the only plate of the Noa Noa Suite, together with Auti te pape (Women at the River) (fig. 54.32 [cat. 59]), in which it plays a major role. Peter Zegers interprets the heart-shaped area on the right as referring to an oyster shell and to the universe as \u201cTa\u2019aroa\u2019s shell\u201d (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works). This is plausible, although it is blue in Ancien culte mahorie and rather looks like a vignette excerpting a portion of the sea. Another comparison could be made with the nut called a coco-de-mer (sea coconut), a specimen of which Gauguin later decorated with surface carving (fig. 54.33). Besides a human head, which Zegers identifies as that of Ta\u2019aroa himself, the ti\u2019ii are represented by two fish heads and a zigzagging line that he thinks could be an eel. Even more striking is the representation of the \u201cinferior atuas\u201d by a tropical fish, since the only marine allusions in the list of these deities are the \u201catua maho (shark gods), patron of the navigators\u201d and the \u201cMatatini (Patron of the makers of nets).\u201d\n\nExcept for the Egyptian origin of the fish motif in the center (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), the elements composing the image appear to derive\u2014directly or, by way of Ancien culte mahorie, indirectly\u2014from studies after nature, which were also very important for Gauguin. In fact, they attest to the artist\u2019s tendency to consider natural forms as a secret writing to be deciphered. He expressed this belief in a passage of Noa Noa in which he described the dried leaves of the pandanus tree as spelling out the name of God (see cat. 51, Commentary). The strange, inchoate forms appearing in the upper-right corner may have been inspired by the observation of a mother-of-pearl shell, a suggestive and ambiguous material that inspired other artists such as the Russian Mikhail Vrubel, who would later depict fantastic female inhabitants in his Pearl Oyster (fig. 54.34). But they may also be based on imprints left by the sea on the sand, as suggested in the watercolor of Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 54.30), in which the color of this area is gray-ocher and the first line of the text speaks of the \u201cti\u2019is of the sands and shores or shifting lands.\u201d This cryptographic relation to the world could have been encouraged by the Oceanic context, in which natural phenomena also served divination: Robert Louis Stevenson reported in 1896 that \u201can unknown fish was thrown upon the coast, an ominous word written on its scales.\u201d Gauguin may also have selected the threadfin butterfly fish (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works) for the one at the bottom because of the false \u201ceye\u201d that it displays at the back: it is an example of the \u201cprotective coloring\u201d of animals that the American artist Abbot H. Thayer and members of his family were studying at the same moment (see fig. 54.35), and it adds another grotesque profile to L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, not unlike those just above it.\n\nBut Gauguin\u2019s imaginative perception of nature also continued a trend that he had cultivated in Brittany, where his friend and follower Armand S\u00e9guin recalled that nature had \u201cspoken\u201d to them: \u201cThe pollarded oak recalls strange animals, the rock under the continuous sculpting of the wave takes on the form of unknown monsters that it perhaps once sheltered, the rim of a wave forms a white arabesque on the blue of the sea.\u201d In L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, the three foam crests of the breaking waves were carved deepest into the wood block and thus appear most luminous, from the first state of the print (cat. 54.1) onward. They can evoke clouds and the phosphorescence of marine microorganisms, often described with enthusiasm by travelers and naturalists. They also probably connote the fecundity of the sea, celebrated by Jules Michelet in his 1861 book La mer (The Sea), and which Gauguin\u2019s print connects to the woman\u2019s body displayed on the shore. The eroticism of this body, which the artist emphasized by adding red color to it in several impressions (see cat. 54.3), is shared by many of his nudes seen from the back, including in Auti te pape (fig. 54.32) and in Vahine no te miti (fig. 54.36 [W 465]), where the intimate connection to the sea and the surf is expressed both visually and verbally in the title, which translates as \u201cWoman of the Sea.\u201d\n\nThe reference to the deluge legend, which ends with the couple seen at left being saved and repopulating the earth, makes it clear that the universe of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 was not created once and for all but at least twice. This corresponds to Gauguin\u2019s conception of artistic creation and to his way of recycling the work of others and his own, not least in the iterative art of printmaking. Natural creation and artistic creation were connected for him; in 1889 he had written that \u201cthe artist himself is one of nature\u2019s means,\u201d hailing Odilon Redon as \u201cone of those she [nature] has elected for this continuation of creation.\u201d Five years earlier, Redon had published a lithographic album entitled Les origines (The Origins), in which the beginnings of the world were visualized as a slow process enacted in the dark by embryonic and hybrid creatures (see fig. 54.37). The writer and art critic Joris-Karl Huysmans had proposed to consider Redon as an heir to the medieval creators of monsters, to which Gauguin had replied that Redon\u2019s creatures were not monstrous but part of nature\u2019s \u201cmysterious infinites, and imaginative power.\u201d\n\nIn L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, Gauguin contributed to this \u201cimaginative power,\u201d and this may be the reason why he devoted his Creation plate, rather than to the higher atuas, to the inferior ones and the ti\u2019ii, whose enumeration in Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an suggests a continuing proliferation. Gauguin was also taken by Moerenhout\u2019s interpretation of the ti\u2019ii as \u201cserving as an intermediary and a demarcation line between organic and inorganic beings, whose respective rights, powers, and prerogatives they indicated and maintained against any usurpation.\u201d The shoreline in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 is a strong embodiment of such a \u201cdemarcation line,\u201d but everything else transgresses the boundaries: the threadfin butterfly fish is situated on the ground, and the tiny human figure walking behind it appears to give it feet; the lotus flower growing out of the fish\u2019s mouth flows into the woman\u2019s leg, and her head and left hand break the border between earth and sea. Gauguin even came back to the middle foam crest after the first state and extended it so that it enters the heart-shaped area or emerges from it.\n\nRedon\u2019s depiction of \u201cthe origins\u201d of life (fig. 54.37) was influenced by evolutionary theory; in the 1901 edition of Noa Noa, Charles Morice would interpret Hina and Tefatu\u2019s dialogue on \u201cThe Eternity of Matter\u201d (see cat. 53, Commentary) as expressing an awareness that death leads to \u201ca new \u2018state\u2019 of the infinite evolution of life.\u201d L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 itself gives a dynamic image of creation, suggesting an amorphous start with the extraordinary impression of its first state (cat. 54.1). It is equally informed by evolution, of which the butterfly fish walking onto the shore could be a comical illustration, symbolizing the moment when sea creatures cross the threshold of terra firma and start breathing. The overall composition, however, is very different from Ernst Haeckel\u2019s genealogical tree (fig. 54.38) or from an illustration in Camille Flammarion\u2019s Le monde avant la cr\u00e9ation de l\u2019homme (The World before the Creation of Man) (fig. 54.39). Both of these images describe the evolution of life as progressive, but ascending and crowned by man\u2014in such a way, with Flammarion, that a gap between the primates and man enables the biblical Adam and Eve to retain their dominion above a Creation hailed by the rising sun. Not so with L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9, in which no clear hierarchy organizes the cohabitation of inferior gods, ineffective guardians, and human survivors, and where the \u201cgreat chain of being\u201d meanders from fish to man and plunges back into the sea.\n\nThe sea, for Michelet, was precisely the milieu in which the \u201cline between organic and inorganic beings\u201d could be crossed, and an expression of life understood as \u201ceternal metamorphosis\u201d and \u201cfluid existence.\u201d The whimsical succession that leads from one upper corner of the print to the other and from spirits to animals to humans and possibly to spirits again seems closer to the premodern logic of the grotteschi, which corresponded to an understanding of nature as continuous, as it is to nineteenth-century scientific illustration, but it may nonetheless owe to both. In his 1902 L\u2019esprit moderne et le catholicisme (Catholicism and the Modern Mind), Gauguin would return to the question of the Creation and criticize the Polynesian together with the biblical genesis as postulating a beginning and a creator god, useless once his creation was completed. He again quoted Moerenhout\u2019s account but changed the last sentence of the cosmogenesis to a simple \u201cL\u2019Univers est\u201d (\u201cThe universe is\u201d), which confirms that in its 1893\u201394 incarnation, the title \u201cL\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9\u201d referred to natura naturans, nature as a continuous process, rather than natura naturata, nature as a product.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Among the group of impressions of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) examined in the Art Institute\u2019s collection and elsewhere, a previously undocumented state between the first and second was discovered in the collection of the Princeton Art Museum.

A contemporary description of Gauguin\u2019s studio:\n\nAu fond, \u00e9tait un hangar vitr\u00e9, comportant un rez-de-chaus\u00e9e et deux \u00e9tages. En haut de l\u2019escalier, \u00e0 la hauteur de second, un balcon desservait trois ateliers. Le troisi\u00e8me et dernier de ceux-ci, au bout de balcon, \u00e9tait celui de Gauguin. . . . Au bout de l\u2019antichambre se trouvait l\u2019atelier. . . . Cette assez vaste pi\u00e8ce, enti\u00e8rement peinte en jaune de chrome clair\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014donnait la sensation imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019\u00e9trange et de l\u2019impr\u00e9vue. Sur les murs, balafr\u00e9s de toile barbares. (At the back was a kind of windowed shed with a ground floor and two upper stories. At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . . An entrance space led to the studio. . . . This rather vast room, painted entirely in bright chrome yellow\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014created an immediate impression of strangeness and unpredictability. On the walls, smeared with barbaric canvases.)\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin, 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), pp. 123\u201324. Colta Ives identified the man at the lower-left corner of the photo as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson hat he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat (1893/94; Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed by Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten woodblock prints. Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Auckland City Art Gallery, 1995), pp. 23\u201324. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the woodcuts do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.

See also Mary Lynn Zink, \u201cGauguin\u2019s Po\u00e8mes barbares and the Tahitian Chant of Creation,\u201d Art Journal 38, no. 1 (Fall 1978), pp. 18\u201321.\n\nJacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, pp. 209\u201315. Gauguin\u2019s transcription, which he entitled \u201cQui cr\u00e9\u00e9 le ciel et la terre? Morenhout [sic] et Tehura me respondent,\u201d is on pp. 134\u201336 (fols. 71V\u201372R) of the bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris, given by Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, 1927, RF 7259.\n\nJacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand ocean (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, pp. 458\u201359.\n\nThe watercolor also features, from left to right, Ta\u2019aroa, a grinning tupapau playing a keyboard-like instrument, and purau (beach hibiscus) or milo (Pacific rosewood) leaves, which are very similar. For the image of a tupapau playing \u201cbarbarian\u201d music, see Ziva Amishai-Maisels, Gauguin\u2019s Religious Themes (Garland, 1985), p. 378. By giving the hand over the keyboard the same skin color as Hina, the image implies that the goddess is playing the instrument. The ambiguity of this detail may have been deliberate on the part of the artist or simply a mistake. There seems to be no Polynesian equivalent for the instrument seen here. On traditional Polynesian instruments, see Mervyn McLean, Weavers of Song: Polynesian Music and Dance (Auckland University Press, 1990).\n\nHowever, the text on the page does not relate to the image; the legend of Roua hatou is found on page 193 (folio 101R). Because Gauguin made the images and then wrote text around them, the two elements were not always synchronized. For Moerenhout\u2019s narrative, see Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand ocean (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, pp. 573\u201374. Gauguin not only copied the explorer-ethnographer\u2019s version of the legend in Ancient culte mahorie but later included it on pages 24\u201325 of the 1893 draft of Noa Noa in the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.\n\nThe Tahitian word for threadfin butterflyfish (Chaetodon auriga) is paraharaha.\n\nThe photographs Gauguin owned were published in 1872 by W. A. Mansell &amp; Company, London, and were available in Paris through the photography agency Adolphe Giraudon. For the Egyptian images that Gauguin owned, see \u201cEgyptian Series. Painting.

Thompson, introduction by Charles Harrison, 1st ser. (W. A. Mansell, [1872]), nos. 223\u201334. Gauguin appropriated the oxen and zebus featured in photograph number 229 for his 1894 painting Nuit de No\u00ebl (Christmas Night) (Indianapolis Museum of Art [W 519]); and in two 1888/89 wood-block prints: Wayside Shrine (Kornfeld 50); and The Ox Cart\u2014Souvenir of Brittany (Kornfeld 51).\n\nThe drawings he made during visits to the Egyptian collection and other parts of the Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris, are contained in the 1888\u201389 Album Walter, R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux, RF 30569/64. Some of pages from this sketchbook are published, along with photographs of the objects Gauguin drew, in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat.

The images of angelfish and triggerfish were executed at some point during his first Polynesian visit.\n\nDwarf angelfish (Centropyge argi), lemonpeel angelfish (Centropyge flavissima), and moustache triggerfish (Balistoides viridescens).\n\nThe recto of this sheet features a brush and gouache drawing related to Te nave nave fenua (see fig. 56.23). The sheet was part of a portfolio whose tapa cover is in the Art Institute of Chicago (cat. 43). The verso with the fish contains the following inscription:\n\nL\u2019aquarelle qui se trouve au verso a \u00e9t\u00e9 achet\u00e9e par M. Pietri magistrat, \u00e0 la vente des oeuvres de [indecipherable] Paul Gauguin, artiste peintre d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 aux \u00eeles Marquises. Cette aquarelle de Gauguin \u00e9tait dans un album dont il ne restait que trois feuillets et qui portait pour titre: \u201cChez les Maories\u2014Sauvageries\u201d\u2014\n\nLa vente a \u00e9t\u00e9 faite par moi sousign\u00e9 [indecipherable] d\u2019enregistrement \u00e0 Papeete, le . . . .\u201d (The watercolor on the back was purchased by M. Pietri, a judge, at the sale of the works of [indecipherable] Paul Gauguin. The artist painter died in the Marquesas Islands. This watercolor by Gauguin was in an album with only three pages left in it that carried the title: \u201cChez les Maories\u2014Sauvageries\u2014\u201d This sale was made by me, the undersigned, [indecipherable, perhaps \u201cofficial\u201d] of records in Papeete, on this day. . . ).\n\nJacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, p. 423, copied by Gauguin in Ancien culte mahorie, ed. Ren\u00e9 Huygue, facsimile ed. (1951; Hermann, 2001), p. 10. Gauguin\u2019s transcription in Ancien culte mahorie and on the print includes a misspelling, cr\u00e9e instead of cr\u00e9\u00e9. Misspellings are not unusual with Gauguin, but it is intriguing that he should have repeated the mistake when carving, and one may note that cr\u00e9e is the third person of the verb cr\u00e9er (\u201cto create\u201d) in the present tense. The fact that Gauguin, contrary to Moerenhout, capitalized the word univers, both in Ancien culte mahorie and in the print, emphasizes the importance and totality of this creative act.\n\nSee Ren\u00e9 Huygue, \u201cLa clef de Noa Noa,\u201d in Paul Gauguin, Ancien culte mahorie, ed. R. Huygue, facsimile ed. (1951; Hermann, 2001), pp. 1\u201331.\n\nJacques-Antoine Moerenhout, Voyages aux \u00eeles du grand oc\u00e9an (A. Bertrand, 1837), vol. 1, pp. 451\u201354, 458\u201359, 573\u201374; Paul Gauguin, Ancien culte mahorie, ed. Ren\u00e9 Huygue, facsimile ed. (1951; Hermann, 2001), pp. 18, 21, 36\u201337.\n\nOn page 37 of Ancien culte mahorie (fig. 54.31), the convex shape represents the Toa marama (pirogue, island, mountain, or arch) on or in which the humans took refuge, but in L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 it suggests a shoreline, the curvature adding a cosmic dimension that can be compared with the earth on which Ta\u2019aroa sits on page 10 (54.28).\n\nOther identifications have been proposed, such as atua maho (shark gods, that is, inferior atuas rather than ti\u2019ii) by Calvin Brown (Alastair Wright and Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat., [Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010], p. 119, cat. 22), and t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2019us by Stephen F. Eisenman, \u201cThe Creation of the World,\u201d in Paul Gauguin: Artist of Myth and Dream, ed. Stephen F. Eisenman, exh. cat. [Skira, 2007], p. 306, cat. 84). Bronwen Nicholson spoke similarly of the \u201cghosts\u2019 heads of the tiis\u201d (\u201cLa suite de gravures sur bois de Noa Noa,\u201d in Paul Gauguin, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit, commentary by Bronwen Nicholson [J. J. Pauvert, 1988]), p. 138. If Gauguin followed Moerenhout\u2019s and his own text closely, the fish heads could refer to the \u201cTii du dehors ou de la mer\u2014gardiens de tout ce qui est dans la mer\u201d (ti\u2019ii of the outside or the sea\u2014guardians of all that is in the sea) and the human head to the \u201cTii de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur, surveillant des animaux et des plantes etc.\u201d (ti\u2019iI of the interior, overseer of the animals, the plants, etc.).

In the Getty draft of Noa Noa, Gauguin placed the deluge legend in the middle of an episode of tunny fishing during which the fish reveals to the narrator (by being caught by the lower jaw) that he is being cuckolded by his vahine and thereby \u201cspeaks\u201d; Nicholas Wadley, ed., Noa Noa: Gauguin\u2019s Tahiti, trans. Jonathan Griffin [Phaidon, 1985], chap. 9, pp. 66\u201367. It may be worth noting that the lower jaws of the two fish heads in the heart-shaped area of L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 are well indicated.\n\n\u201cLe ch\u00eane \u00e9mond\u00e9 rappelle d\u2019\u00e9tranges animaux, le roc sous la sculpture continuelle de la vague garde la forme de monstres inconnus qu\u2019il a peut-\u00eatre abrit\u00e9s, l\u2019ourlet d\u2019une lame donne l\u2019arabesque blanche sur le bleu de la mer.\u201d Armand S\u00e9guin, \u201cPaul Gauguin,\u201d L\u2019occident 16 (Apr. 1903), p. 166.
