    "copy": " Every frame has its own history that walks in step with prevailing aesthetic tastes of the time, whether those of the artist, collector, or patron. The frame also serves as a link between the art a frame surrounds, the architecture in which it is situated, and the viewer. Frame conservation works to ensure that the visual appearance and structural integrity of the frames in the museum\u2019s collection are preserved and protected. We assist the museum\u2019s curatorial team to provide frames that are both aesthetically and historically harmonious with the work of art. Along with the conservation of period frames, the department also fabricates new frames created in period styles. A significant portion of our work is preventative. To ensure that the artwork and frames are safe for display and travel, we also create special housings and supports, glazing, and microclimates.   Featured Projects ",
