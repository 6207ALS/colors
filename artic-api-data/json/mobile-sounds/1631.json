    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Beneath the wide sky, whose misty clouds hint at the changeable weather of Venice, business is carried out as usual on the Grand Canal.  Citizens visit the Baroque church of Santa Maria della Salute on the right.  This splendid church was designed in thanks for the deliverance of the Venetian people from an outbreak of the plague in 1630.  Beyond the church you can see a little tower topped by a ball.  This is the city's customs house.  Its presence on the Grand Canal reminds us that Venice owed much of its historical wealth and power to its great trading prowess.  Black gondolas carrying passengers and commercial barges ply their trade on the water, and to the left is the large pink-colored palace of the doges, or rulers of Venice.  The scene is by Francesco Guardi.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: Guardi was one of the foremost &quot;vedute&quot;, or view, painters of Venice in the 18th century.  He depicted many scenes in an exquisite painterly manner, using broad brushstrokes to create a vibrancy of mood and light that captures this everyday scene in Venice.  These pictures were prized in particular in the 18th century by British travelers who wanted a memory to bring back with them once they returned to England from their grand tours around Europe.</p>\n",
