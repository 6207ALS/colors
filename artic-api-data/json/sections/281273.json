Way\u2019s catalogue of 1896, he described this lithograph as \u201ca group of friends round a tea-table in the garden of Mr. Whistler\u2019s house in Cheyne Walk.\u201d In his revised catalogue of 1905, he added the identities of the individuals. From left to right, they are Mrs. Brandon Thomas, Walter Sickert (standing), Sidney Starr, Brandon Thomas, Beatrix Whistler, and Ethel Birnie Philip. Sidney Starr recorded an especially vivid description of the site and the occasion: \u201cOn Cheyne Walk, not many doors from the house in which Rossetti secluded himself, was in the latter years of his life that of Whistler, with its old-world garden, where beyond the lawn and the mulberry-tree were the flower beds and the summer-house; on Sunday afternoons in summer here stood the tea-table, and the master and his wife were at home. Sometimes Whistler would make a lithograph of his guests sitting about the table, not talking as he worked, dressed in a blue serge suit, the \u2018pilot-coat\u2019 buttoned, the ends of his black ribbon tie floating over the lapels, his narrow-brimmed straw hat, with black ribbon band, a-tilt over his nose.\u201d In its casual, even intimate, atmosphere and the varied handling of the crayon, The Garden is a direct forerunner to lithographs that Whistler would draw three years later in the garden of his home on the rue du Bac, Paris (see cat. 88, cat. 89, cat. 90, cat. 100, and cat. 101).\n\nThe lithograph was most likely drawn in late June 1891, after the artist\u2019s return from a trip to Paris, and was probably one of two drawings transferred and proved by the Ways on 27 June 1891 (app. II.3 and app. II.4). On July 23 Whistler sold an impression (listed as Gray\u2019s Inn Garden) to Howard Mansfield, which suggests that the artist was satisfied with the image. Nevertheless, The Garden was never printed in any significant numbers and no impressions remained in Whistler\u2019s possession at the time of his death. Although he originally included the print in his list of lithographs to be shown at the Fine Art Society exhibition of 1895\u201396 (app. I.1), it was not among those finally chosen.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (320 \u00d7 203 mm), signed; MWC, cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 199 mm). Glasgow: HAG (2), cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 201 mm); cream Japanese paper (276 \u00d7 202 mm). London: BM, cream Japanese paper (276 \u00d7 214 mm). Washington: FGA, cream laid paper (318 \u00d7 204 mm); NGA (2), cream wove paper (316 \u00d7 200 mm), signed; cream Japanese paper (309 \u00d7 213 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other impressions are found in New York, MMA and NYPL; and San Francisco, AFGA.  \nNesta R.

Way had listed, but crossed out, these names in a proof copy of the 1896 catalogue; Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., Pennell Collection.\n\nSidney Starr, \u201cPersonal Recollections of Whistler,\u201d The Atlantic Monthly 101, no. 4 (April 1908), p. 535. This description, and Rosalind Birnie Philip\u2019s use of the title The Tea Party, Chelsea, clearly place the site in Chelsea. Nevertheless, there has been some confusion over the identity of the garden because Whistler himself used the inexplicable titles Gray\u2019s Inn Gardens and Lincoln\u2019s Inn in conjunction with this lithograph; see app. I.1 and GUL NB1/30, 75. These two locations are close together in the City. Although Whistler made a number of etchings in the park of Gray\u2019s Inn during the late 1880s, it seems unlikely that he would have confused the locations.\n\nGUL NB1/75.\n\nGUL LB6; transcribed in MacDonald (1988), p. 40.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 40, only state.
