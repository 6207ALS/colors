    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Dating to between 650 and 800 AD, these small figures are roughly contemporary to the life size seated figure behind you.  These figures have been found in the Yucatan Peninsula and nearby areas of present day Mexico in the heartlands of ancient Maya civilization.  They are astounding achievements in working with clay on a small almost jewel like scale.  They are partly made from molds then further modeled, fired and painted.  Notice the anatomical features of the bodies and the expressions of the faces, they're absolutely convincing portrayals of human form and character.  In terms of what they're for, they were tomb figures, many are warriors such as this tall standing man meant to acknowledge the fighting spirit of the deceased.  The exceptionally charming standing male figure, the red one holding his round belly up is a rattle in the form of a mythological figure and that belly no doubt has pellets in it that rattle to invoke a supernatural spirit accompanied by musical chance.  Notice the way the foreground figure is being pulled forward by his belly, his shoulders are dropped, the pose is amazing, he looks so lifelike like the Maya people we see living in the Yucatan today.  He, like other figures nearby is certainly not a mythological creature, they portray the people living in a particular time and place, they have human character.  When you walk by, if you spend just a second you will be transfixed by them, they truly provide one of the most magical moments in the museum.</p>\n",
