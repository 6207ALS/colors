But I\u2019m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God\u2019s will. And He\u2019s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I\u2019ve looked over and I\u2019ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the Promise Land. And I\u2019m happy tonight. I\u2019m not worried about anything. I\u2019m not fearing any man. My eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\n\nThe next day, he was assassinated on this balcony outside room 306.\n\nFrom the series, On This Site: Landscape In Memoriam",
