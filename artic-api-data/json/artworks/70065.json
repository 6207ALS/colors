    "description": "<p>Norwegian-born artist Jonas Lie received great acclaim for his luminous renderings of New York City. His unique merging of Impressionism with a bold, painterly realism was admired for its potency and vigor, which was seen as a healthy antidote to the more delicate styles of many American Impressionists. <em>Afterglow</em> also intrigued contemporary critics for its depiction of the city. Many reviewers questioned whether Lie's gleaming view of lower Manhattan\u2014especially the monumental buildings of the financial district\u2014was intended as an allegory or as a commentary on American economic power and aspirations. In these readings, the glowing buildings suggest a wondrous city of gold, yet one that remains tantalizingly in the distance.</p>\n",
