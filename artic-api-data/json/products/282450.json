    "description": "<p>The scope of the book is deliberately broad, with a thematic first section that describes the skyscraper's historical evolution from antecedents rooted in the very human desire for a commanding height, and then a geographical second section. Conceptual chapters introduce advancements in engineering and materials that permitted the first \"tall\" buildings to rise at the end of the 19th century and explore the skyscraper's role in fueling our imaginations through different modes of cultural expression.</p><p>Paperback, 256 pages.</p>",
