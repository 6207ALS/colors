    "description": "<p>During the late nineteenth century, Parisian caf\u00e9s were the gathering places of artists and writers and were ideal locations for observing the urban scene. Many Impressionist paintings depict the Caf\u00e9 Nouvelle-Ath\u00e8nes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for \u00c9douard Manet and his circle\u2014a group that included the painters Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and the writers Charles Baudelaire and \u00c9mile Zola.</p>\n<p>At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite caf\u00e9: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet's paintings and the caf\u00e9 a re-creation in his studio.</p>\n<p><em>Woman Reading</em> is one of the most Impressionist of Manet\u2019s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.</p>\n",
