    "description": "<p>Reynolds created this binding based on Duchamp's windows, Fresh Widow (1920) and Brawl at Austerlitz (1921). In 1936 Duchamp revisited his windows and had the Brawl printed on paper and celluloid for Andr\u00e9 Breton's Au Lavoir noir (Paris: Editions GLM, 1936). It was enclosed loose in each of the seventy copies. Presumably, Reynolds revisited this concept with him with this inspired fen\u00eatre binding as a result.</p>\n<p>Duchamp created his windows with opaque panes that could not be seen through: functional objects that did not function, another of his plastic puns. Unlike Fresh Widow, the window panes on this binding are not completely darkened, but dotted with uneven holes, inviting the viewer to look in, but allowing only a glimpse of the contents.</p>\n<p>&quot;Pataphysics,&quot; a concept Jarry (1873\u20131907) introduced in this book, is the study of a realm additional to metaphysics, a science of imaginary solutions. Pataphysics welcomes all scientific explanations for the universe, suspending all values moral, aesthetic, and otherwise. Jarry regarded reality as a cosmic joke.</p>\n",
