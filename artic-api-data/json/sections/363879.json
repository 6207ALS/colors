It is a copy of Mother and Child, No. 1 (cat. 51), an image left untransferred after it was drawn on fine-grained transfer paper in 1891. In his memoir of 1912, T. R. Way recalled Whistler\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for several old subjects that he came across while making revisions to some of his lithographs in late 1895. Way explained that \u201cwhilst revising his many drawings upon the stones, he looked up other drawings, not till then transferred, one a charming mother with a little naked child in her lap, drawn in 1890 [sic], which, for fear it should fail, he redrew first upon a second piece of transfer paper; both were laid down and the earlier drawing proved quite successful.\u201d\n\nWay described Mother and Child, No. 5 as a \u201crepetition\u201d in his 1905 catalogue. In fact, the major contours of this image correspond so closely to those of Mother and Child, No. 1 that it seems clear that Whistler created his second version of the subject by tracing the older drawing through a sheet of transparent transfer paper. However, a few departures from the basic configuration of the earlier image are visible: in Mother and Child, No. 5, the outline of the mother\u2019s head is slightly reduced; the long expanse of the sofa is abbreviated; the lines of drapery in the background, the folds in the model\u2019s gown and in the fabric falling over the couch, and the hatched lines throughout the image are drawn freehand, rather than traced; and the butterfly monogram is shifted slightly to the right.\n\nWhen the two images were transferred to stone and printed in 1895, the earlier drawing proved more successful than the copy. Whistler made some minor revisions on the stone for Mother and Child, No. 1 and, eventually, had the printers pull a sizeable number of impressions. He was less satisfied with Mother and Child, No. 5, as a result, very few proofs were pulled of the image and the stone was erased by 1896. Although Way (1905) recorded a printing of four impressions, only one has been located to date, an impression acquired by Howard Mansfield in or before 1908. Another impression was mentioned in the correspondence between T. R. Way\u2019s widow and the Chicago collector Bryan Lathrop, but its present location is unknown.\n\nChicago: MWC, ivory wove proofing paper (287 \u00d7 222 mm), signed.  \nNesta R. Spink, Harriet K.

On 13 April 1913, two months after her husband\u2019s death, Mrs. T. R. Way offered a proof of Mother and Child, No. 5 to Lathrop, who was trying to complete his collection of Whistler lithographs. A few days later, Mrs. Way wrote again to say that three of the images she had offered him, including Mother and Child, No. 5, were no longer available.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 138, only state.
