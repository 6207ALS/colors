In doing so, it contextualizes local expressions and appreciations of what the makers and audiences of the varied works on view consider aesthetically pleasing or disagreeable, and invites us to reevaluate the arts of the African continent from the perspectives of the communities and individuals who created and used it.</p><p>Simply show your member card or digital member card to enter.</p><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"/events?audience=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more member programs</a>.</p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
