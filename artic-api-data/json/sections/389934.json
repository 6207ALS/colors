R. Way recalled Whistler\u2019s remarks when asked about the location of the shopfront depicted in this lithograph. The artist identified the site as part of a group of old Queen Anne houses on Cleveland Street. Way could not remember any such buildings and, when he went to seek them out, found the subject instead to be \u201ca sort of superior industrial dwelling of quite recent date.\u201d Way, a serious antiquarian who recorded many old London buildings in his own lithographs, was clearly amused by Whistler\u2019s mistake. He concluded his remarks about the matter by saying that the artist was \u201calways attracted by the picturesqueness of old buildings, yet, from sundry remarks, I am pretty sure that his antiquarian knowledge was very slight.\u201d In any event, Way\u2019s perseverance provides us with a locale on Cleveland Street, close to the studio Whistler had taken at 8 Fitzroy Street.\n\nThe Butcher\u2019s Dog was transferred and proved along with the drawing for St. Giles-in-the-Fields (cat. 167) on 13 April 1896 (app. II.4). Whistler then made successive revisions to the stone. In the second edition (1905) of his catalogue, T. R. Way maintained that there were four states of The Butcher\u2019s Dog, adding that \u201calthough the modifications made to each are clear, when they are laid side by side, they are not easy to describe.\u201d There was considerable variation in the inking of the stone. Some impressions (such as the first-state impression in the collection of the British Museum, London; fig. 166a) were so lightly inked that Whistler\u2019s alterations are difficult to discern, while others were inked so heavily that it may seem as though more tonal work was added to the stone.\n\nThere is some fine scraping visible on the two figures in the butcher\u2019s shop, on the dog\u2019s legs and chest, and on the dark leg of the child sitting in front of the doorway at left. T. R. Way (1905) called attention, in the first state, to a black spot in the doorway, which \u201cone can notice gradually disappearing through succeeding states.\u201d\n\nGlasgow: HAG (2), ivory laid paper (301 \u00d7 181 mm), signed, and signed and inscribed verso, in Whistler\u2019s hand, \u201cThe Butcher\u2019s Dog\u201d / 1st State; ivory laid paper (292 \u00d7 208 mm). London: BM, cream wove proofing paper (282 \u00d7 202 mm). Washington: NGA, cream wove proofing paper (223 \u00d7 179 mm), inscribed, in an unknown hand, 1st state.\n\nRemarks: Another first-state impression is found in Cleveland, CMA.\n\nRevisions have been made directly on the stone. The dark spot in the doorway has been reduced slightly by scraping. Additional lines above the capitals extend the piers between the second-story windows, and new shading darkens those windows further. Shading has also been added to the shopfront window, to the leg of beef hanging in the window, and to the extended leg of one of the figures within the shop.\n\nChicago: MWC, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 201 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG (4), ivory laid paper (301 \u00d7 183 mm); ivory laid paper (302 \u00d7 216 mm); ivory laid paper (302 \u00d7 220 mm); ivory laid paper (301 \u00d7 181 mm). London: BM, ivory wove proofing paper (277 \u00d7 207 mm). Washington: NGA, cream laid paper (284 \u00d7 201 mm), signed.\n\nRemarks: Other second-state impressions are found in Brooklyn, TBM; and New York, MMA (2).\n\nThe spot in the doorway has been diminished further in a unique impression found in the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow.\n\nGlasgow: HAG, ivory laid paper (302 \u00d7 215 mm).\n\nThe spot in the doorway has been made almost indiscernible with additional scraping. The leg of beef has been lightened further. The piers extending above the capitals that were added in the second state have been removed, and the shading in the second-story windows has again been modified to soften the shadows. As a result the second-story structure does not bear down so heavily on the rest of the composition as in the previous state.\n\nChicago: AIC, ivory laid paper (298 \u00d7 211 mm), signed. Glasgow: HAG, cream laid paper (295 \u00d7 210 mm).
