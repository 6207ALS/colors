    "description": "<p>New and longtime fans of Joseph Cornell are invited to drop in to Gallery 396 for a rare and special opportunity to see three of Cornell\u2019s boxes up close, out from behind the protective cases that typically keep them separated from viewers. Inspired by the fact that the artist\u2019s enchanting box compositions were often intended to be interacted with as objects and activated by their beholders, museum staff will show off several boxes from multiple angles and demonstrate their interactive components, while sharing stories of the creative life and legacy of this singular artist.</p><p><em>This program is made possible by the generous support of the Joseph and Robert Cornell Memorial Foundation.</em></p><p>If you have any questions about programming, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:museum-programs@artic.edu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">museum-programs@artic.edu</a>.
