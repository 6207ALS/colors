This exhibition is the first dedicated to Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s formative early years in Paris and the first to focus exclusively on his cartes postales , precise prints on inexpensive yet lush postcard stock. It brings together over 100 rare carte postale prints from collections across Europe and North America to offer insight into the period in which Kert\u00e9sz produced some of his iconic images and charted a new path for modern photography. Printed at an intimate scale, Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s photographs suited his needs as both an immigrant and an ambitious amateur: he could carry his prints throughout Paris, share them with artist friends and potential patrons at the caf\u00e9 table, or mail them to faraway family members as evidence of his increasing skill and professional success. The exhibition pays careful attention to the works as both images and objects, emphasizing their experimental composition and daringly cropped formats. Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s early images\u2014of artist friends, Parisian scenes, and avant-garde still lives\u2014also communicate the possibilities of the French capital as a meeting ground for international artists\u2014a city where the lessons of avant-garde painters, sculptors, and poets could resonate for a photographer finding his way. \u201cAlthough Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz is one of the key figures of 20 th -century photography, most people don\u2019t know the depth of his work from this period,\u201d said Elizabeth Siegel, the exhibition\u2019s curator. \u201cI\u2019m thrilled to offer the public the chance to view these rare prints together.\u201d Due to the limited opportunities in his native Hungary, Kert\u00e9sz moved to Paris in the fall of 1925, arriving with little more than his cameras and some savings. By the end of 1928, he was contributing regularly to magazines and exhibiting his work internationally alongside well-known artists like Man Ray and Berenice Abbott. The three years between his arrival in Paris and his emergence as a major figure in modern art photography marked a period of dedicated experimentation and exploration for Kert\u00e9sz. During this time he carved out a photographic practice that allowed him to move between the realms of amateur and professional, photojournalist and avant-garde artist, diarist and documentarian. And for those three years only, Kert\u00e9sz produced most of his prints on carte postale paper, turning this popular format toward artistic ends, rigorously composing new images in the darkroom and making a new kind of photographic object. During this period, he also produced some of the images that would come to define his career, including Chez Mondrian (1926), an exquisitely composed scene of Piet Mondrian\u2019s studio emphasizing the painter\u2019s restrained geometry; Satiric Dancer (1927), uniting photography with dance and sculpture by fellow Hungarians in Paris; and Fork (1928), declaring that photography could transform into art even the most humble of objects. Vintage carte postale prints of all three are included in the exhibition. Postcards from Paris is curated by Elizabeth Siegel, Curator of Photography and Media at the Art Institute of Chicago. After Chicago, the show will travel to the High Museum of Art in Atlanta in 2022.
