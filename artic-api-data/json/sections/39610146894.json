Are You Jealous?)  \n1894  \nWatercolor monotype from a glass matrix, with brush and white gouache, reddish-brown and black water color, on cream wove paper (an imitation Japanese vellum); 195 \u00d7 232 mm  \nThe Art Institute of Chicago, gift of Edward McCormick Blair, 2002.236  \nField 1973 10, Druick/Zegers 27  \nFor the verso, see fig. 65.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">The monotype Aha oe feii? (What! Are You Jealous?) is based on a painting of the same figures, which Gauguin completed two years earlier, in 1892, during his first Tahitian trip (fig. 65.2 [W 461]). At the time he created the painting, he described the composition in a letter to his friend Georges-Daniel de Monfreid: \u201cI recently did a nude without using a model, two women at the edge of the sea, I think that it is still my best thing to date.\u201d In the various media in which he repeated or modified the scene\u2014including a plate for his 1893/94 Noa Noa Suite (fig. 65.3 [cat. 59]) and a second monotype (fig. 65.4 [Field 1973 10])\u2014it transformed and took on new meanings that are ever more personal and dreamlike.\n\nIn both the painting and the Art Institute\u2019s monotype, two nude Tahitian women rest on a red pareu along a shoreline. The seated female, who wears a wreath of white flowers, appears in four of Gauguin\u2019s later paintings and is modeled after a relief of a crouching silenus in a frieze from the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, of which Gauguin owned a photograph (see cat. 59, fig. 59.8). The landscape that surrounds the women is quite abstract\u2014rendered in nebulous patches of brilliant color\u2014and the figure in repose appears to dematerialize into the water. It is difficult to discern land from sea, but a curved tree trunk, nestled in small tufts of grass at the upper left, offers some differentiation.\n\nThe title Gauguin gave the painting, Aha oe feii?, was translated into French as \u201cEh quoi! Tu es jalouse?\u201d (What! Are you jealous?) for the 1893 exhibition of works he completed during his first trip to Tahiti at the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris. The painting, along with most of the others on view, failed to find a buyer. Perhaps in light of this commercial failure, Gauguin began work on his manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, in order to provide a French audience with a context in which to understand his unfamiliar Tahitian scenes. He wrote the following description of the painting, which is more detailed than the actual composition:\n\nFar off in the distance the ocean is dimly lit by sluggish canoes steered by youngsters with paddles, or more so by their bodies\u2019 motion, with their blue and white sarongs and sun-kissed chests glowing amidst the luminous air and their teeth glistening through bursts of laughter. On the shore, two sisters lie sensuously, their vulnerability exposed as they talk about past loves and future romances. A memory causes a rift between them: \u201cSo what? Are you jealous?,\u201d says one to the other.\n\nThe medium of the monotype lends another level of abstraction to the beach scene described in the text, further obscuring the distinction between land and sea. The unpredictable aspect of the transfer process can produce watery areas of color and faint outlines. While the spatial relationship between the two women is ambiguous in the painting\u2014the figures appear disconnected and certainly not as intimate as in the description provided by Gauguin\u2014in the monotype, the pale tranferred outline of the recumbent women, in contrast to the strong, penned outline of her seated companion, places the two in decidedly separate realms. The elusive character of the painting and the monotype relates to Gauguin\u2019s desire to distance his depictions of landscape from the act of observation. In a letter to his friend and fellow painter \u00c9mile Schuffenecker dated August 14, 1888, he wrote, \u201cA hint\u2014don\u2019t paint too much direct from nature. Art is an abstraction! Study nature then brood on it and treasure the creation which will result, which is the only way to ascend towards God\u2014to create like our Divine Master.\u201d\n\nIn Gauguin\u2019s wood-block print of the subject, the recumbent figure almost entirely disappears from the composition (fig. 65.3). This could have resulted from an error that the artist made when carving into the wood matrix. If his incising tool slipped, Gauguin may have eliminated the figure to obscure the mistake. However, as Peter Zegers discovered, the rocklike mound to the left of the seated figure is the same shape as the recumbent female\u2019s head. The transformation of this female into the earth could well have been intentional. Gauguin was fascinated by shorelines, areas of direct contact between land and water. Of continuous relationships in nature, he wrote, \u201cI have gazed at the horizons, seeking the harmony between human life and plant and animal life in compositions in which I reserved an important role for the great voice of the earth.\u201d Thus the recumbent woman has not disappeared, but rather has been reconstituted into an element of nature.\n\nIt is likely that Gauguin transferred the scene directly onto the wood block from the monotype matrix. While Gauguin\u2019s methods for making monotypes cannot be established for certain, it appears that he traced the figures (on this process, see below) from the painting Aha oe feii? for the monotype (and the Noa Noa wood-block print) because, when an image of the painting is reduced, reversed (to account for the printing process), and layered over the monotype, there is a striking correspondence between the two figures (see fig. 65.5). In 2002 Zegers established that Gauguin used a plate of glass to create monotypes, citing the writer Julien Leclercq, who, in an article from 1898, described the process: \u201cGauguin painted with watercolor on a sheet of glass and pulled impressions on dampened paper.\u201d To create a monotype like the Art Institute\u2019s Aha oe feii?, Gauguin would likely have placed a dampened piece of paper on top of a glass plate covered with drawn and painted media, and applied pressure to transfer the drawing to the paper.\n\nIf indeed Gauguin used the painting Aha oe feii? for the monotype figures, he could have created the glass matrix by securing the glass to a mount in front of the painting. He could then have traced the figures from the painting onto the transparent glass surface by moving the mount in and out based on his physical distance from the painting, thus reproducing the image on a smaller scale. This would also explain the reversal of the composition, from painting to monotype, since pulling the dampened paper from the glass flips the image. Gauguin could then have shifted the image onto the glass matrix in order to manipulate the position of a hand or the size of a limb, while the relative position of the figures and curve of individual lines remained the same.\n\nIn the course of his involvement with wood-block printing and monotypes while in Paris, Gauguin experimented with combining the two techniques. Zegers discovered that, when the wood-block print Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59) and the Art Institute\u2019s monotype Aha oe feii? are superimposed, the seated figure in both compositions is nearly identical in size and form (see fig. 65.5). It is likely that Gauguin transferred the scene directly onto the wood block from the monotype matrix.\n\nIf Gauguin did not hold up a glass plate to trace the figures directly from his painting, perhaps he used a photograph of the work to translate the image onto the glass. He could have positioned the photograph, reduced in size from that of the original painting, on a flat surface and placed a layer of glass on top of it. He could have created a new matrix on the glass by tracing the photograph underneath (the glass would act as a piece of tracing paper). In fact, Gauguin referred to photographs throughout his career to inform his compositions. Not only did he consult photographs he collected of Buddhist reliefs from Java, Egyptian art, Classical sculpture, scenes of the rural life of Tahiti, and works by artists he admired, but he owned a camera at three different times in his career, beginning in the 1890s. A September 1893 description of his studio in Paris on the rue Vercing\u00e9torix notes that \u201cin a corner there is a large camera, 18 \u00d7 26 format, mounted on a stand.\u201d He pasted photographs of his own paintings and drawings into his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, which indicates that he had access to photographs of his own work (which he could then trace and reproduce) (see fig. 65.6).\n\nThe reproductive process used in the Art Institute\u2019s monotype Aha oe feii? sheds light on yet another of Gauguin\u2019s complex printmaking processes, in which he borrowed imagery from his own oeuvre. Yet, in this example, he created an image whose narrative can be read as distinct from the related canvas. The monotype tells a story of transformation, highlighting the ephemeral nature of bodies and their symbiotic relationship with the earth.  \nMel Becker Solomon\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">From the artist to Roderic O\u2019Conor (1860\u20131940), Paris and Nueil-sur-Layon, France.\n\nBy descent to his wife, Ren\u00e9e Honta (1894\u20131955), Nueil-sur-Layon, France, until 1955.\n\nH\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, by 1956.\n\nMr. O.

Thus they were probably pulled independently from a monotype matrix and are not the results of two consecutive pulls, as was previously thought.\n\nGauguin may have also used the verso of a photographic glass-plate negative of the painting directly to create the monotype matrix. I am grateful to Sylvie Penichon, conservator in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s Department of Photography, for her collaboration on this idea.\n\nFor more on Gauguin\u2019s photograph collection, see Bernard Dorival, \u201cSources of the Art of Gauguin from Java, Egypt and Ancient Greece,\u201d Burlington Magazine 93, no. 577 (Apr. 1951), pp. 118\u201322.
