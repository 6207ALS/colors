    "transcript": "<p>Valentina:  We are currently looking at the Totonac chair, which was a design that Clara Porset made inspired by the sculpture that\u2019s right next to it on the photograph.</p>\n<p>Like the rest of the practitioners in the exhibition, Clara Porset was inspired generally by looking at techniques and traditions and different ways of making both ancient and modern in Mexico.</p>\n<p>Andrew Hamilton: What\u2019s amazing about Clara Porset\u2019s 1952 design for the Totonac chair is how it channels the form of the original figurine that inspired it. Throughout ancient Mesoamerica, figurines played an important role in culture, and were often included in burials. Some of the most famous were created by the Mayas. A lot of these objects were actually made from clay, and that\u2019s important because you can see in this photograph how the maker actually had to roll the clay out into sausages and that causes it to taper toward the ends and swell towards the center. Now look back at Porset\u2019s chair, and see how she captured that same swelling within the wood. It\u2019s incredibly sensitive, because the wood had to be carved rather than rolled like the ancient clay.</p>\n<p>Valentina: It certainly built into the philosophy of \u201cour own kind of furniture\u201d as she was incorporating the aesthetic values that were already there and preexisting in a society.</p>\n",
