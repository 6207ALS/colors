    "description": "<p>An 1868 treaty, signed at gunpoint, allowed the Navajo back onto ancestral lands in Arizona after 20 years of raids and slaughter capped by the genocidal \u201cLong Walk\u201d east to captivity in New Mexico.</p>\n<p>This richly hued picture shows labor clearly\u2014drying ears of corn and a double loom are in brilliant focus\u2014while the laborers appear blurred and idle. But these four Navajo men still seem stubbornly present. The one half-hidden at the back, and the one who turns his face away, may be actively resisting portrayal. Such presence and tacit resistance both run counter to romanticized images of the Navajo as actively dangerous or disappearing\u2014images that already were fast becoming clich\u00e9s.</p>\n<p>See also: Robin Kelsey, Archive Style (2007); James C. Faris, Navajo and Photography (1996)</p>\n",
