    "description": "<p>In 1964, a year in which race riots and the Beatles both exploded across the United States, Garry Winogrand received a Guggenheim fellowship and embarked on a cross-country trip that led him to take almost 20,000 images. Some of his most memorable photographs that year, however, were made in his native New York. Using a small 35mm camera, Winogrand redefined street photography, nimbly capturing chance juxtapositions and unconsciously repeated gestures. He photographed incessantly and swiftly, claiming, &quot;I photograph to find out what something will look like photographed.&quot; This image was selected by John Szarkowski, then curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of <em>Women Are Beautiful</em>, a 1975 portfolio of 85 images of women taken by Winogrand over a number of years.</p>\n",
