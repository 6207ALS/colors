Whistler painted this portrait of his brother William in London, where both of them then lived; the artist had established a studio there in 1859. Having served as a medical officer for the Confederate Army, Dr. William McNeill Whistler moved to the city after the Civil War and was a respected physician. Whistler modeled his brother\u2019s face with some degree of detail, yet also employed broad brushstrokes of thinly applied paint to merely suggest the sitter\u2019s dress, which blends into a background of flat color.</p>\n",
