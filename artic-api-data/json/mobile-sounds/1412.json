    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: The arched panels on this splendid thirteenth century tile are more than decoration. They\u2019re an essential element of Islamic religion, the mihrab. The mihrab is the niche in a mosque, shrine, or mausoleum that indicates the direction of Mecca, the city in present day Saudi Arabia, towards which observant Muslims pray five times daily. This tile, which probably came from a tomb, is unique because it has two niches instead of the usual one. The decoration is made up almost entirely of raised calligraphy. Although this tile was made and used in Iran where people spoke Persian, the inscriptions are written in Arabic. There from chapters called surahs of the Islamic holy book the Koran. Islam accords great significance to the Arabic language because it was in Arabic that God, through the angel Gabriel, conveyed his holy message to the prophet Mohammed in the seventh century C.E.  That message was written down as Koran. Calligraphy is highly respected in Islamic society as a form of high art. Calligraphy appears in numerous mediums from architecture to manuscripts and carpets. Tile work with Koranic verses similar to this example could be found throughout the Islamic world from Spain to Central Asia. The inscription above the niches is from Surah 55. It reads, \u201cEveryone must pass away and there will endure forever the countenance of your Lord.\u201d</p>\n",
