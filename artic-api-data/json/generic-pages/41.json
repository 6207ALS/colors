    "copy": " The World\u2019s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago is recognized today as one of the defining moments of American cultural history. Whether it marked \u201cthe first expression of American thought as unity,\u201d as Henry Adams believed, or, as Louis Sullivan later remonstrated, \u201cThe damage wrought by the World\u2019s Fair will last for half a century from its date,\u201d the Exposition had a profound impact on American architecture and urban planning. The defining style of the Exposition, a modern interpretation of classical Greek and Roman forms, was an outgrowth of the influential Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, one of the few sources of formal architectural education in the 19th century. The Beaux-Arts, or \"City Beautiful,\" style proved to be nearly as long-lasting as Sullivan had warned and through the work of prominent architects such as Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett in Chicago it became especially popular in the design of major civic buildings and in the master planning of urban centers in the United States and abroad. In addition, the important role of architects in world's fairs was repeated forty years later in the 1933\u201334 Century of Progress Exhibition in Chicago, when Burnham's sons were closely involved in its planning and design, although in this instance, in a forward-looking international Moderne idiom.

William Peirce Anderson Collection, 1886\u20131915 1.5 linear feet [P] Anderson was one of the most important Beaux-Arts-trained architects in Daniel Burnham's office. He largely shaped the office's plan for the cities of Manila and Baguio in the Philippines, and directed the design work for Marshall Field's flagship store in Chicago and Union Station in Washington, DC. After Burnham's death in 1912, he became a partner in the successor firm of Graham, Anderson, Probst, & White. This collection primarily consists of his Ecole des Beaux-Arts student work, including assignments, class notes, essays, and drawings. It also includes exquisite travel sketches and watercolors, correspondence, and photographs. Related material can also be found in the Department of Architecture . Finding Aid View selected images from this collection   Edward H. Bennett Collection, 1901-2015 (bulk 1905-1950) 18 linear feet [P] Bennett (1874\u20131954) was one of the first young architects with a Beaux-Arts education hired to work in Daniel Burnham's Chicago office. With Burnham he co-authored the Report on a Plan for San Francisco (1905) and the influential Plan of Chicago (1909). Bennett maintained a national practice from his Chicago office for nearly four decades after the publication of Plan of Chicago. From the Chicago model Bennett developed comparable City Beautiful plans for numerous cities, including Minneapolis, Detroit, Portland, Oregon, and Ottawa, Canada. With the onset of the Depression, Bennett's most important professional activity was the chairmanship of the Board of Architects. The Board was responsible for the development of the Federal Triangle in Washington, DC, a large complex of government buildings housing the Departments of Labor, Commerce, and Justice, the Post Office, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Archives. The collection contains correspondence, project files, published and unpublished speeches and articles, photographs, architectural drawings, and reports.

Burnham Collection, 1836-2019 (bulk 1880-1925) 40 linear feet [P] Although he was never formally educated in architecture, Burnham (1846\u20131912) established a successful Chicago practice with John Wellborn Root, producing such significant buildings as the Rookery and the first building for the Art Institute of Chicago. As Director of Works for the World's Columbian Exposition (1893) he supervised the design and construction process for all buildings on the fair grounds. During the next twenty years his firm became internationally known for commercial skyscrapers, department stores, and railroad stations primarily designed in the classical Beaux-Arts style. Burnham's vision of the City Beautiful ideals, tentatively explored in the planning of the world's fair, was realized in his report Plan of Chicago (1909). The plan has long served as the most important of City Beautiful documents and continues to be the benchmark for planning decisions in Chicago. The Art Institute holds the largest body of documents on Burnham's life and works, including business and personal correspondence, diaries, project files, photographs, drawings, memorabilia, published and unpublished manuscripts for speeches, articles, and reports.

Burnham, Jr. and Hubert Burnham Papers, 1890\u20131978 (bulk 1912\u20131943) 25 linear feet [P] Daniel H. Burnham's sons continued to work in his successor firm for a few years after their father's death in 1912, then established their joint practice in Chicago. The collection documents many commercial and civic buildings in Chicago and northern Illinois designed by the brothers. Both men played important roles in the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago (1933\u20131934): Daniel Jr. was secretary and director of works, and Hubert served as a member of the Architectural Commission. The collection reflects their roles with extensive holdings of business and design papers generated by some of the commercial ventures at the fair, particularly the Foreign Village Corporation. The collection includes business diaries, scrapbooks, photographs (including construction views), correspondence, and several thousand architectural drawings representing projects from the brothers' various partnerships, including the Carbon and Carbide Building in Chicago.

Document types include correspondence, meeting minutes, planning and project documentation (proposals, drafts, reports, and evaluations), educational and promotional materials (produced both by the Committee and its Program Partners), visual materials (posters, banners, still and moving images) as well as some three-dimensional objects. Finding Aid   Century of Progress Collection, about 1920s\u20131980 (bulk 1931\u20131934) 7 linear feet [P] The Century of Progress, Chicago's world's fair of 1933\u20131934, brought international modernism to the country's heartland. The foreign government buildings and the progressive designs for contemporary residences and corporate exhibits introduced many Americans to the new style.
