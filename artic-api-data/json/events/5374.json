    "description": "<p>Join Jonathan Tavares, curator of Applied Arts of Europe, in conversation with Lisa Ackerman, associate conservator of objects, as they share insights into the two-year conservation project to restore Grinling Gibbons's intricately detailed, carved limewood overmantel, originally made for the house at Cassiobury Park.</p><p>Sometimes called the \u201cMichelangelo of wood carving,\u201d&nbsp;Gibbons was prolific in late 17th- and early 18th-century England. His works could be found in country houses, palaces, churches, and cathedrals across the country. In 1926, the Art Institute acquired Gibbons's overmantel, and over 300 years after its creation undertook the exciting challenge of&nbsp;restoring it.</p><p>With the overmantel fragmented into over 160 pieces, it took a team of scholars, donors, conservators, and curators to return his masterwork to its original composition. Through use of historic photographs, scientific analysis, tooling, and sculptural clues, the team was able to reverse its extensive damage.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event</strong> <strong>that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
