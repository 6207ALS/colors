Cast (or perhaps sagged), tooled, wheel-cut, and polished. Exterior rounded by grinding. The vessel wall tapers with twenty-eight thick, vertical ribs toward a thin-walled, slightly kicked base. Irregular horizontal tool marks on the upper outer edge and the tops of some flattened ribs, a wheel-cut groove on the interior below the rim, and two smaller wheel-cut grooves on the interior two-thirds down the vessel wall. For a zoomable image, see fig. 75.1.\n\nThere are patches of weathering product, iridescent areas, and some slight pitting. A large crack in the rim runs down to a repair or loss covered entirely by unrelated iridescence.\n\nThere may be a very slight twist to the rib pattern compared to cat. 77. In discussing a related bowl, Clasina Isings classified this as form 3b by its more hemispherical form; like cat. 77, it is found on many sites and in dozens of museum and private collections.\n\nPerhaps the closest in profile and color is in the Princeton University Art Museum. Also quite close in profile are one of transparent blue-green glass in the same collection and a colorless bowl with a gray tinge and amethyst streaks in the Corning Museum of Glass; others are in the Toledo Museum of Art, one of pale greenish yellow and the other of blue; a yellowish-brown example in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem; a smaller bowl of yellow-brown with similar profile but fewer and heavier ribs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; and a bowl of the same color formerly in the Ernesto Wolf collection, Stuttgart.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Isings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, pp. 17\u201320, form 3b.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 56, no. 21, acc. no. y1966-117.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 57, no. 22, acc. no. y1967-27.\n\nGoldstein, Pre-Roman and Early Roman Glass, p. 155, no. 332, acc. no. 52.1.79.\n\nGrose, Early Ancient Glass, pp. 266\u201367, nos. 239 and 241, acc. nos. 23.669 and 23.509.\n\nIsraeli, Ancient Glass in the Israel Museum, p. 80, no. 68, acc. no. 85.72.105.\n\nLate 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D., acc. no. 15.43.212.\n\nStern and Schlick-Nolte, Early Glass of the Ancient World, pp. 294\u201395, no. 84.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 75 Bowl, late 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.\n\nfig. 75.1 Bowl (late 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D.).
