    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Before the American Revolution, a clock in an American home was likely to be an impressive piece of cabinetry. And a tall one, because of the long hanging weights and pendulum that moved the gears behind the face. By the beginning of the 1800s new technology eliminated the need for weights, allowing for a smaller case, and helping to bring about a unique style of American clock-making. Because of its unusual shape, this type of clock is commonly called a &quot;Banjo Clock.&quot; But its original name was, &quot;The Improved Timepiece.&quot; The inventor, Simon Willard of Massachusetts, registered the design in 1801. This example was made in 1803, by Elnathan Taber. He had started as an apprentice at the age of 16 with the Willard family, and went on to become a notable clockmaker himself. Let's look more closely at his timepiece. It's in remarkably untouched condition, from the American eagle on top, to the bracket shelf underneath. The cabinet is made of wood, with applied ornamentation skillfully made from gesso and gilt. The scenes on the neck and base are made of glass panels painted from behind, an economical and durable alternative to enamel or porcelain. Also, notice the numbers on the clock's face, they're a departure from traditional Roman numerals that you can see on the tall clocks in these galleries.</p>\n",
