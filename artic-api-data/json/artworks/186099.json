The inscription below her left arm, which translates to \u201cWith passionate heart, your human arrow,\u201d was often used by Kokoschka in his letters to Kallin. <em>Malina</em> (raspberry) was Kokoschka\u2019s pet name for her and appears at the top left of the drawing. While the artist had written of her \u201cstern and beautiful\u201d eyes in a letter to her, this rendering captures the uncertainty brought on by their long distance relationship.</p>\n",
