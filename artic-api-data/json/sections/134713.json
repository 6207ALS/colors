This enormous drawing remained in private hands until it was acquired by the Art Institute of Chicago in 2006. Thus, despite its importance, until recently it has been largely unknown. Many critics and curators who published exhaustive studies of Ensor\u2019s life and work ignored the drawing until 1987, when the late Ensor scholar Robert Hoozee called attention to it in an important publication on Ensor\u2019s etchings and drawings written with Sabine Taevernier and Jan Frederik Heijbroek. As another Ensor specialist, it is my privilege to convey the importance of The Temptation as a demonstration of the artist\u2019s genius and in the development of modernism, while underscoring the significant role Antwerp played in Ensor\u2019s life and critical fortunes.\n\nIn addition to being privately owned, The Temptation was rarely exhibited. It was shown with the Brussels artists\u2019 collective Les XX (Les Vingt; 1883\u201393) in 1888 and 1889, and is listed in the respective catalogues, but it went unsold until 1922, when it was bought by Antwerp connoisseur Maurice Speth, with the proviso that it remain in Ensor\u2019s studio for up to ten years (see Director\u2019s Statement). Its next public outing was in 1929, in a large Ensor retrospective, staged to inaugurate the Palace of Fine Arts in Brussels. It was shown in 1951, probably for the last time, in the retrospective organized shortly after Ensor\u2019s death at the Royal Museum of Fine Arts in Antwerp.\n\nA previous director of the Antwerp museum (1904\u201319), poet and critic Pol de Mont, elicited from Ensor a pivotal letter that explains the intellectual motivation behind the artist\u2019s work. Written in late 1894 and rediscovered only in 1972, it reveals Ensor\u2019s aversion to the classical art theory advanced by professors at the European art academies until the end of the nineteenth century. He argued that art should instead be as grand and compelling as Richard Wagner\u2019s music and professed that he did not believe in searching for carefully considered forms that approach an ideal of beauty because \u201ca correct line cannot inspire lofty feelings, it cannot express passion, anxiety, struggle, sorrow, enthusiasm, poetry . . . those beautiful and grand feelings. . . . Wagner aroused my enthusiasm . . . I glimpsed an enormous and magnificent world.\u201d\n\nHere and in his numerous other writings, Ensor constantly asserted that there was no greater wrongdoing than to create something banal. According to the artist, the main means to fight banality was to explore a variety of mani\u00e8res, by which he apparently meant subjects, techniques, genres, and conceptual approaches. Ensor employed this term for the first time in the letter to Pol de Mont, in which he discussed various kinds of work he was creating, including \u201ccompositions\u201d\u2014the standard academic term for depictions not made from life. Within this category, speaking of \u201ccurious compositions\u201d (compositions singuli\u00e8res), Ensor cited the drawing now in the Art Institute:\n\nIn The Temptation of Saint Anthony some scenes are truly demonic. Savage or grotesque devils are swarming through the air. They use any means by which to seduce or bewilder the Holy One. Terrifying tribulations assault him: young, beautiful, seemingly sensitive women function as merciless executioners. They slaughter, beat, and burn. Undoubtedly, the artist doesn\u2019t like women because he is always abusing them in his compositions. Other scenes are particularly comical. Eccentricity prevails everywhere, the most confusing details abound, and characters move around by the hundreds. Up above, with a halo, appears the sorrowful face of Christ.\n\nCritics and scholars have repeatedly drawn attention to the exceptional diversity of Ensor\u2019s oeuvre and its astonishing contemporaneity. But it is in Ensor\u2019s writings themselves that we find the justification to analyze his creative activities as a visual artist, writer, and musician as a collection of diverse experiments or projects in which he explores the varying possibilities of first one, then another, medium; or of any number of stylistic, iconographic, and technical ideas. The Temptation, assembled from fifty-one separate pages, can itself be seen as an amalgam of experiments: diverse experiments of the kind that constitute Ensor\u2019s Wagnerian struggle against banality and attest to his belief that art can give humans a glimpse of the unattainable bliss that, for him, represented the ultimate aim of life itself.\n\nA better knowledge of Ensor\u2019s social and artistic perspectives makes it clear that, to whatever extent the perplexing Temptation may be the result of his constant experimentation, the artist only occasionally ventured into modernist territory. After World War II, however, art historians lost sight of the extent to which the \u201cimaginative\u201d or grotesque part of Ensor\u2019s oeuvre borrowed from archaic genres and iconographic patterns. They placed much more emphasis on the modernist character of the design and the subversive and subjective character of the iconography, obscuring the humorous aspects of the artist\u2019s work.\n\nEnsor called Antwerp \u201cthe most hospitable of all mothers!\u201d In 1905 the Antwerp exhibition society Kunst van Heden/L\u2019Art Contemporain organized the first large retrospective of his work and, from that time on, some of the artist\u2019s most active and enthusiastic supporters could be found in that city. In 1921, on the occasion of the second large Ensor retrospective, Kunst van Heden (which had also organized several traveling exhibits of the artist\u2019s work) hosted a banquet at which he sang the praises of the city and thanked individual collectors, including Maurice Speth, as \u201cgenerous of heart and feeling.\u201d That today Antwerp has the best and most extensive collection of Ensor\u2019s paintings and drawings is due primarily to the extraordinary generosity of the members of the group, including Speth, the prescient first owner of The Temptation of Saint Anthony, which has now found a place of honor in Chicago.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Robert Hoozee, Sabine Bown-Taevernier, and Jan Frederik Heijbroek, James Ensor: Dessins et estampes (Fonds Mercator, 1987), pp. 128\u201329, especially. the large images in color on pp. 83\u201393.\n\nSee Susan M.

Apparently Pol de Mont had initially written Ensor in Flemish. In his reply, Ensor explained that, although he did speak his mother\u2019s language, he had difficulty reading it, and he asked Pol de Mont to henceforth write him in French. See Uwe M.

Parmi ces oeuvres, il y en a sans doute que vous ne connaissez pas. Je crois bien faire en indiquant sommairement le sujet. Dans La Tentation de Saint Antoine quelques sc\u00e8nes sont vraiment d\u00e9moniaques. Des d\u00e9mons f\u00e9roces ou grotesques pullulent. Ils emploient tous les moyens pour s\u00e9duire ou \u00e9pouvanter le Saint. D\u2019horribles supplices y sont inflig\u00e9s: des femmes jeunes et belles paraissant sensibles font l\u2019office de Bourreaux sans piti\u00e9. Elles \u00e9gorgent, assomment, br\u00fblent. L\u2019artiste n\u2019aime pas la femme sans doute car il la maltraite toujours dans ses compositions. D\u2019autres sc\u00e8nes sont extracomiques. Partout la bizarrerie domine, les d\u00e9tails les plus d\u00e9routants abondent, les per sonnages s\u2019y meuvent par centaines. Au-dessus aur\u00e9ol\u00e9e, la figure souffrante du Christ appara\u00eet.\u201d The passage continues by dating the work to 1887 and mentioning \u201cune composition \u00e9galement singuli\u00e8re: Les diables Dzitts et Hihahox command\u00e9s par Crazon, montant un chat furieux, conduisent le Christ aux Enfers.\u201d Ensor to Pol de Mont, Dec. 5, 1894, Kunstmuseum an Zee, published in James Ensor: Lettres, ed.

Ingrid Pfeiffer and Max Hollein (Hatje Cantz, 2005), p. 9: \u201cWhat is it that makes Ensor\u2019s work so invigorating and fresh, so new and so exciting? It probably has something to do with some tendencies in contemporary art: the pluralism of styles, the return to the figurative and narrative, the simultaneity of painting and drawing, ornamental tendencies . . . meaningful content and humor.\u201d\n\nHerwig Todts, \"James Ensor, occasioneel modernist: Een onderzoek naar James Ensors artistieke en maatschappelijke opvattingen en de interpretatie van zijn kunst\" (Ph.D. diss., University of Ghent, 2013); available at \u201cEnsor: Occasional Modernist,\u201d James Ensor: An Online Museum, http://jamesensor.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/en/research/webpublications/ensor-occasional-modernist.
