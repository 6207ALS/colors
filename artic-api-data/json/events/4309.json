    "description": "<p>From the grotesque to the political, the mundane to the playful, performance art has evolved to encompass a wide range of creative approaches and attitudes. This four-part lecture series invites you to consider key moments in the history of performance art and explore the work of artists who are continuing to blur boundaries and redefine artistic practice. This series coincides with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Iterations</em>, an initiative presenting newly commissioned works by a range of artists over the next three years.</p><p>In the second lecture of the series, assistant curator Jordan Carter highlights key players and moments of this highly influential group known as Fluxus that blurred the boundaries between artistic media, performer and audience, artwork and event.</p><p>Please join us for the other lectures in this series:</p><p><a href=\"/events/4307/lecture-an-introduction-to-performance-art-in-four-partshistories\" target=\"_blank\">Histories</a><br>Friday, March 15 at 3:00</p><p><a href=\"/events/4310/lecture-an-introduction-to-performance-art-in-four-partscontemporary-approaches\" target=\"_blank\">Contemporary Approaches</a><br>Friday, April 12 at 3:00</p><p><a href=\"/events/4311/lecture-an-introduction-to-performance-art-in-four-partsa-conversation-with-michael-portnoy\" target=\"_blank\">A Conversation with Michael Portnoy</a> <br>Thursday, April 18 at 6:00</p><p>Persons with disabilities who would like to request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program are encouraged to send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.&nbsp;</p>",
