Under Minerva\u2019s protection, Telemachus has accomplished the feat granted to no mortal of descending to the underworld by entering the sulfurous cavern near the southern Italian city of Acherontia. In Hades, spirits of the dead and creatures of the night surround him. In search of his father Ulysses\u2019s spirit, Telemachus will discover that he is still alive.</p>\n",
