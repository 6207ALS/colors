    "transcript": "<p>Julie Simek: When I first look at the painting, my eyes are immediately drawn to the three performers in the lower right corner. My name is Julie Simek and I'm a conservator of paintings. But then, almost immediately, other aspects of the painting draw your eye up and around the composition. And there's so many things to look at that your eye is constantly moving.</p>\n<p>Annelise Madsen: This is Sargent's painting entitled &quot; Rehearsal of the Pas de Loup Orchestra at the Cirque d'Hiver&quot; painting around 1879 in Paris. I'm Annelise Madsen, a curator of American art. Concerts of popular music were held in the amphitheater known as the Cirque d'Hiver. It had become a part of Parisian life beginning in the 1860s when the conductor Pas de Loup worked to bring classical music to a wider audience. So in that spirit, he opened up the Cirque d'Hiver during rehearsals and Sargent went there with fellow artists and listened to the music. Sargent was a accomplished piano player and had a keen ear for music. Sargent is very swift and notational in the way that he lays down the paint on the canvas and gives us a sense of the scene, the instruments, the musicians, almost note-like strokes of paint. It's much more abstract, but yet, when you look at the whole painting, it really portrays the sort of cacophony of sounds and activity that would have been experienced if you were sitting in the audience during this rehearsal.</p>\n",
