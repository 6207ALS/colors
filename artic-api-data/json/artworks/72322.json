    "description": "<p>In 1967, Westermann was invited to spend a week as an artist-in-residence at the Kansas City Art Institute, which had organized an exhibition of his work.  His visit was organized by the sculpture faculty and Jack Lemon, who had trained as a printer-fellow at Tamarind and was teaching and operating the print shop at the Institute.  During his stay, Westermann completed his first four lithographs in collaboration with Lemon.  Two of the resulting prints are exhibited here. Their raw energy attests to the artist's inexperience with the process as well as his cultivated drawing style.</p>\n",
