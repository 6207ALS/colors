    "description": "Georges Seurat (French, 1859\u20131891) A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884, 1884\u20131886 Sunday in the shadows of the park, enigmatic and still. In A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884, Georges Seurat captured the Parisian bourgeoisie at leisure, complete with a monkey on a leash and a fashionable woman fishing the Seine. With formal structure and a decidedly motionless quality, his influential painting stepped away from Impressionism\u2019s fleeting imagery and broke ground for Neo-Impressionism.
