    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This early bronze age marble sculpture portrays a female figure entirely through geometric shapes and incised lines. Thousands of similar figures have been discovered dating to the third millennium B.C. Here\u2019s Karen Manchester, the museum\u2019s curator of ancient art.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER: They appear abstract to us today because they are missing the decoration they once had. They were once brightly painted with faces, sometimes necklaces, hair.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Scholars called these Cycladic figures after the islands where they were found southeast of Greece, a circular archipelago in the Aegean Sea known as the Cyclades. Most Cycladic figures are female nudes like this one suggesting a symbolic link to fertility.</p>\n<p>KAREN MANCHESTER:  We don\u2019t know their original function. Very few of them have been found in an original context except for a group that was reportedly found in a hoard on the island of Keros where they were broken and buried. We do know that many of them were painted and we do find evidence on some of them of repainting. So we do think that on the basis of the repainting that they probably did have a function during the owner\u2019s lifetime. But what it was we just simply don\u2019t know.</p>\n",
