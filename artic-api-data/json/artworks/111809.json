The figure at the center is depicted with the portrait head of an emperor from the Julio-Claudian dynasty (27 BCE\u201368 CE) and the idealized, partially nude body of the supreme deity Jupiter (the Greek god Zeus). He holds the god\u2019s scepter and thunderbolt while an eagle, Jupiter\u2019s companion animal, perches at his feet. Created for circulation among members of the imperial court, the cameo boldly equated the ruler\u2019s power over the Roman Empire to that of Jupiter over the entire cosmos.</p>\n",
