    "description": "<p>A native of Ohio, George Wesley Bellows studied early on with Robert Henri, a proponent of urban realism. Encouraged by Henri, Bellows sought out subjects that represented the vitality of the everyday lives of New Yorkers. His first studio was located across the street from Sharkey\u2019s Athletic Club, where he became an avid boxing fan. A number of dramatic paintings, such as his 1909 <em>Stag at Sharkey\u2019s</em> (now in the Cleveland Museum of Art), established his reputation as the preeminent painter of this quintessential urban subject.</p>\n<p>In 1913 <em>American Magazine</em> commissioned Bellows to produce four drawings to accompany an article by L. C. Mo\u00edse recounting the fight between former lightweight champion Jimmy Nolan and his nemesis, Tornado Black. <em>Counted Out</em> is one of the four. When the fight started, the two men could hardly contain their hatred for one another, and the energy inside the ring fueled the frenetic audience. Just before the third round, Nolan realized he had \u201clost his punch,\u201d and did everything possible to fend off Black\u2019s fierce attacks. When he finally mustered his \u201clast ounce,\u201d he prevailed, and the \u201cTornado dropped senseless to the floor.\u201d The four drawings together illustrate the entire event; the Art Institute\u2019s sheet depicts Nolan\u2019s moment of triumph. We don\u2019t know whether Bellows actually attended the fight, but he faithfully adhered to many visual details in Mo\u00edse\u2019s article, such as the long scar on Black\u2019s face and Nolan\u2019s disfigured ear, overly pronounced jaw, and dramatic pose.</p>\n<p>For this drawing, Bellows used lithographic crayon, a medium he preferred for its ability to create rich gradations of black. He emphasized the theatricality of the scene by placing the viewer inside the ropes, using dramatic lighting that heightens certain faces in the crowd while obscuring others, and by exaggerating gesture, such as the referee\u2019s wildly splayed arms and Black\u2019s crucified pose. Finally, Bellows constructed the composition around a strong pyramidal shape formed by the three protagonists, which draws us into the action and directs our focus.</p>\n",
