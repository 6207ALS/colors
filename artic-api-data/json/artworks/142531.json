    "description": "<p>These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This \u201cfunerary couch\u201d was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet.  Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.</p>\n<p>The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain.  Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges.  The left and right stones\u2014one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings\u2014may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch.  The two stones between them\u2014depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)\u2014together may have formed the back of this structure.  As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward.  Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.</p>\n<p>Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones.  The figures\u2019 proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings.  Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small \u201cofficial\u201d caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women.  Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns.  These figures are grouped in stagelike settings\u2014hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands\u2014which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.</p>\n",
