II.3, II.4, III.2, V.1  \nSelected Literature: Pennell (1897), p. 286; Way and Dennis (1903), p. 85  \nLifetime Exhibitions: London 1895\u201396 (no. 46, as Shops, Chelsea); Chicago 1900b (nos. 16 and 17)\n\nThis view of shopfronts in Chelsea is closely related to several etchings, watercolors, and small oils Whistler created in the 1880s and 1890s. Especially close in both vantage point and attention to architectural elements of the old buildings are Chelsea Shops (YMSM 246), Chelsea Houses (YMSM 290), and Carlyle\u2019s Sweetstuff Shop (YMSM 375), all oils on panel of the 1880s. By 1888, when this transfer drawing was made, frontal views of shops and houses had become frequent subjects in Whistler\u2019s work.\n\nThe drawing appears to have been executed rapidly, with a light touch, and when first proved it looked very much like a chalk or pencil sketch. After a few impressions had been pulled, Whistler removed most of the hatched shadow above the central doorway, thereby emphasizing the simplicity of the forms. The subject is one of the five drawings (cat. 23, cat. 24, cat. 25, cat. 26, and cat. 27) listed in Way\u2019s invoice as having been transferred and proved on 8 June 1888 (app. II.3 and app. II.4).\n\nWay (1905) recorded only one state of Chelsea Shops, and listed a total of seventeen impressions pulled from the stone, a number that seems to encompass both of the states identified here. However, nineteen impressions can be documented in the correspondence between Whistler and Way (see letter 24, letter 25, letter 34, and letter 86). A further discrepancy exists in the 1903 inventory of Whistler\u2019s estate, where Rosalind Birnie Philip listed five signed and twenty unsigned impressions.\n\nShading above the central doorway has not yet been removed.\n\nCHICAGO: MWC, grayish ivory chine (126 \u00d7 203 mm) mounted on off-white plate paper (278 \u00d7 383 mm). LONDON: BM, grayish white chine (125 \u00d7 203 mm) mounted on white plate paper (265 \u00d7 362 mm).
