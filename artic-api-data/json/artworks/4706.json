While the surface was still damp, fresh stucco was applied and modeled into decorative motifs and figures, which were left white to contrast with the painted background. This relief panel and its partner (1922.4428) likely came from the same building. In this panel, a winged female figure is flanked by two deer and standing on a delicate tendril motif.</p>\n",
