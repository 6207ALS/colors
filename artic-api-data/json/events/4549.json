    "description": "<p>Art Insights provides a historical and enlightening art-enrichment experience for older members of the community who may be unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's Museums at Home series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based Art Insights conversations on a national scale. To participate in this program, a telephone or a computer with internet access is required.</p><p>This discussion is devoted to the later life and works of \u00c9douard Manet, whose still-life paintings and portraits of Parisian women unapologetically embrace beauty and visual pleasure. Manet continued to challenge conservative art critics until the end of his life, demonstrating a responsiveness to the moment and a dedication to the continual flowering of his artistry.</p><p>This virtual presentation is presented by Art Insights volunteer lecturer Dave Williams and hosted by Well Connected, a nonprofit community of adults 60+ who come together via phone- or computer-based conversations, lectures, classes, games, and much more.</p><p>For more information or to register, please call (877) 797-7299, email <a href=\"mailto:coviaconnections@covia.org\">coviaconnections@covia.org</a>, or visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://covia.org/services/well-connected/\" target=\"_blank\">https://covia.org/services/well-connected/</a>.</p><p>This program is available via telephone or computer only and is not offered on-site. Persons with disabilities who would like to visit the museum and experience an on-site program may request an accessibility accommodation by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> two weeks in advance of the program.</p>",
