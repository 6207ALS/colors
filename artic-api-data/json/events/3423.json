    "description": "<p>>Antropofag\u00eda, a process central to Tarsila do Amaral\u2019s art, was a term coined in 1928 by poet Oswald de Andrade, Tarsila\u2019s then husband and a father of Brazilian modernism. His \"Manifesto antrop\u00f3fago\" (Cannibal Manifesto) argued that Brazil has a history of \"cannibalizing\" other cultures, digesting them and producing something entirely new. He encouraged this form of cultural synthesis as a way for Brazil to assert itself against European post-colonial cultural domination. As a founder of the Antropofag\u00eda art movement, Tarsila combined the visual language of European modernism with the subjects and palette of her homeland to produce a uniquely Brazilian modern art. Quiles and Lindsay will discuss antropofag\u00eda in Tarsila\u2019s art in the context of the 1920s, and explore contemporary extensions and perspectives. </p><p> class=\"standard-sand\"><strong>About the Speakers</strong></p><p>><strong>Daniel Quiles</strong> has been the Associate Professor, Art History, Theory &amp; Criticism at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago since 2009.
