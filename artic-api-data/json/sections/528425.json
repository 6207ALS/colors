Ryerson, 1922.4886\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">The clasped hands of the imperial couple and the cry of \u201cconcord\u201d belie the mutual hatred attested by Caracalla and his beautiful young wife, Fulvia Plautilla. Her father, Plautianus, was the Praetorian Prefect, and staggeringly rich; Caracalla\u2019s father, Septimius Severus, wanted to invest in that potential for family enrichment and arranged the marriage when both were barely teens. The coinage of Plautilla presents an astonishing number of portrait types, eleven in just two and a half years, and all quite lovely and with variations in hairstyle. This hairdo, similar to the \u201cearly\u201d style of her mother-in-law, Julia Domna (see cat. 59, Aureus (Coin) Portraying Empress Julia Domna), suggests a date closer to 202, when the marriage took place, than to 205. The fineness and abundance of the portraits make one wonder if the mint, under direction from Severus, wanted to muster up support for the desperately unhappy girl. The obverse and reverse inscriptions are both in the dative case, so that this coin can be read as \u201cto Plautilla Augusta\u201d and is dedicated \u201cto eternal concord [of the couple].\u201d Caracalla, who was recognized as Augustus by age ten and was impatient for the throne, saw Plautianus as a rival, and in A.D. 205 got his father to destroy the Prefect, confiscate his wealth, and exile Plautilla to the Lipari Islands off the north coast of Sicily. As soon as Severus died in 211, Caracalla had her executed.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Nodelman, \u201cPortrait of the Empress Plautilla,\u201d p. 105.\n\nHiesinger, \u201cJulia Domna,\u201d pp. 40\u201341.
