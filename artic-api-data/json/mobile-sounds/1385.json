    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Like jewelry worn to adorn a beautiful face, this porcelain pouring vessel called a kendi sits within silver mounts fashioned in England.  Blue and white porcelain have been imported from China since the 15th Century.  After this piece arrived in England around 1600, a silversmith added the metal armature to make the ewer more European in design.  The silver mounts protect and enhance the simpler form of the porcelain vessel by adding a scrolled handle, a longer spout, a round base and a hinged lid.  Without the silver handle, it would have been necessary to hold the porcelain kendi by the neck as the Chinese did.  The blue and white kendi was made in China in a period before the Europeans understood how to make porcelain themselves.  The kind of clay used to make such luminous and watertight forms seemed destined to remain a Chinese and later Japanese secret.  But in the early 18th Century, deposits of the white burning clay called kaolin that the Chinese had used were discovered in Germany near the city of Meissen.  Europeans finally had the crucial ingredient to create their own precious porcelain.  Before then, Chinese imports were adapted like this one to suit Western expectations, they could remain beautiful and still serve a practical purpose for the European who wanted to use it.</p>\n",
