    "description": "<p>A pioneer of the California Light and Space movement of the 1960s, Turrell builds environments that invite viewers to experience \u201cthe material of light through the medium of perception.\u201d <em>Rayna</em> is from James Turrell\u2019s early series of <em>Space-Division</em> constructions, which he began in 1976. In these works, a pivotal but initially elusive aperture divides a single room into two separate components\u2014an outer viewing room and an inner \u201csensing\u201d space. Viewers enter the dimly lit outer room through a dark corridor, seeing first what appears to be a flat, rectangular panel hanging on the far wall. As one approaches, the rectangle grows increasingly pronounced until, up close, it reveals itself to open onto a space beyond that seems filled by an almost tangible mist of light. The rectangular opening can be perceived by the viewer in two ways:  as a wafer thin plane of light suspended in space and as infinite space.  Both perceptual phenomena are based on the reception of light on the retina, to which Turrell attaches a mystical or, at least, otherworldly interpretation. He once referred to the resulting effect as \u201clooking-at-the-space-looking-at-you.\u201d</p>\n",
