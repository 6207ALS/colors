He is identifiable by his falcon head (once crowned with a sun disk inserted into the hole at the top of his head) and the golden hieroglyphs at the center of his belt, which read, \u201cRe-Horakhty, Chief of the Gods.\u201d Re-Horakhty was worshipped throughout Egypt but was particularly revered in Iunu, an ancient city located near modern Cairo that the Greeks called Heliopolis (\u201ccity of the sun\u201d) in his honor. Statuettes of deities such as this one were set up in temples and shrines to receive offerings or presented to the gods as gifts that were later ceremonially buried.</p>\n",
