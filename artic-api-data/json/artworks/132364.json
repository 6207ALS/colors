    "description": "<p>Executed in the \u201cneo-grec\u201d style, this suite of silver was commissioned by the United States government and presented to Viscount d\u2019Itajub\u00e1 of Brazil in gratitude for his role in arbitrating grievances between the United States and Great Britain after the American Civil War. It was the first of three identical suites made by Tiffany and Company, as indicated on each piece by the \u201cNo. 1\u201d stamped on the underside. Figures and symbols decorating these objects represent ancient Greek themes. The handles on the punch bowl portray Dionysus, the god of wine, and the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144349/pair-of-wine-coolers\">wine coolers</a> (1996.15.1-2) depict facemasks of Silenus, a woodland god and Dionysus\u2019s constant companion. The full-figure, chased plaques on the wine coolers represent Agriculture and Commerce and were meant to symbolize the continued stability and prosperity of the United States after the Civil War.</p>\n",
