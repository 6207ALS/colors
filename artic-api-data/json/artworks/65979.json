    "description": "<p>By the time Marin painted this dramatic image of a schooner riding the currents from Stonington to Boston, he had become known for his keen sensitivity to the unique properties of Maine, especially the life of the sea. His passion for boats was celebrated and, along with his forceful and emotional handling of paint, this subject became an icon of his persona. Here Marin used his wide three-centimeter brush, working the watercolor so vigorously that bristles became lodged on the work\u2019s surface. The distinctive silver shadow-box frame\u2014designed by Stieglitz\u2014sets the watercolor back in space and reflects the artist\u2019s interest in balancing oppositional visual forces.</p>\n",
