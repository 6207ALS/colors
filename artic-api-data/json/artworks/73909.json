    "description": "<p>In 1952, Roy DeCarava became the first African American photographer to receive a Guggenheim Fellowship. In his application, the chronicler of Harlem stated, \u201cI want to show the strength, the wisdom, the dignity of the Negro people. Not the famous and the well known, but the unknown and the unnamed, thus revealing the roots from which springs the greatness of all human beings.\u201d In pursuit of this goal, DeCarava frequently photographed people during their commute in New York City\u2019s subway stations. Here, however, he presented an ambiguous moment: a man rests on the subway steps, suggesting vagrancy, a fall, or some other unknown circumstance. DeCarava increased the illegibility of the image by shooting from an odd vantage point and\u2014as was his preference\u2014by using only the limited available light, lending the scene an eerie, shadowy cast.</p>\n",
