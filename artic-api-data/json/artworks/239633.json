    "description": "<p>Jutta Koether engages and challenges canonical male artists through a distinctive perspective that is at once decidedly irreverent, self-reflective, allegorical, and gendered. Always attentive to questions of staging and display, she has hung paintings from the ceiling or on floating glass panels, and she frequently experiments with lighting conditions. Her <em>A Bar at . . . #</em> reimagines \u00c9douard Manet\u2019s renowned <em>Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re</em> (1882; Courtauld Gallery, London), in which a server stands behind a marble countertop, a long mirror in the background. She looks straight ahead; a man, possibly the subject of her pensive gaze, appears as a reflection behind her. In Koether\u2019s reworking of this iconic painting, the subject is now naked, and the confrontation is directly with the viewer. The artist holds a mirror up to us\u2014spectators implicated in the work\u2019s content through our own act of looking.</p>\n",
