    "description": "<p>A photojournalist known for his images of Asia, Marc Riboud was a member of Magnum, the photography agency founded by Henri Cartier-Bresson and others to maintain artistic control of their images. In his work, he maintained a sympathy for the laborer and the gesture of the everyday, arguing, \u201cPhotography cannot change the world, but it can show the world, especially when it is changing.\u201d This photograph of a Mexican fisherman taking a siesta with his chicken was one of more than 20 of Riboud\u2019s photographs that Hugh Edwards acquired during his tenure. In 1964 he organized a one-person show of Riboud\u2019s work, noting in the press release that the photographer \u201cshows us humanity as anonymous beings to whom all of us are related.\u201d</p>\n",
