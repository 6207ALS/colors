In 1899, as part of his endeavor to publish a monthly periodical, he used the back of the block to carve this and another headpiece for Le sourire (The Smile): Fox, Busts of Two Women, and a Rabbit (cat. 120). The block was carved so that the vignettes face each other; they abut along their bottom edges. The commercially available wood-block was manufactured with a series of four screws to hold smaller segments of boxwood together. The voids left by the apertures from this assemblage were appropriated by the artist to add his initials and to inscribe numbers. The block is extant and in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (fig. 111.3.2). This impression was printed and published posthumously by Pola Gauguin in 1921.\n\nThe impression is richly printed in black ink. The combination of meticulous inking, careful wiping, and use of a smooth, absorbent China paper conducive to lifting the ink from the block\u2019s surface resulted in a crisp, highly detailed impression. Given that the block was manufactured with screws, it appears that care was taken to tighten and realign the three segments so that, when printed, the joins were properly aligned.\n\nThe signature at lower left is prominently represented in the posthumous impression. Additional stray marks appear at bottom center where the block was most heavily inked; they are not readily apparent in Gauguin\u2019s impressions, although some evidence of them does appear in the November 1899 issue (cat. 109) of Le sourire.\n\nThis posthumous impression was printed on a smooth ivory China paper, the paper favored for printing all of the prints in the posthumous edition.\n\n103 \u00d7 184 mm (image); 268 \u00d7 425 mm (sheet)\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
