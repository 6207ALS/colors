The region had featured in many of the artist\u2019s works from earlier decades, including The Beach at Sainte-Adresse from 1867 (cat. 13 [W92]) and Cliff Walk at Pourville from 1882 (cat. 19 [W758]), during the period in which Monet was most engaged with the portrayal of breathtaking views of Normandy\u2019s coast, sea, and sky.\n\nThe decade before Monet painted The Customs House at Varengeville was a significant turning point in Monet\u2019s personal and artistic life, leading numerous scholars to argue that the 1880s could be considered the most important of the artist\u2019s career. The death of his first wife, Camille, in 1879, left Monet a widower with two young children. Alice Hosch\u00e9de, matriarch of the family with whom the Monets had been cohabiting since 1878 and who would marry the artist in 1892 after her husband\u2019s death, was \u201cessential in enabling Monet to avoid . . . pathological mourning and creative paralysis.\u201d Furthermore, the nature of their relationship, as well as the relative financial security he began to enjoy in this period, allowed him the freedom to travel extensively in the 1880s. The remote Belle-\u00cele off the coast of Brittany in 1886 and the Creuse Valley in central France in 1889, among other locations, exposed Monet to topographical extremes, and the work he created there reveals his increased preoccupation with producing paintings in series.\n\nMonet\u2019s travels in the 1880s occurred amid the splintering of the group of artists who made up the Impressionist core. A trip to Italy in 1881 shifted Pierre-Auguste Renoir\u2019s attention to the techniques of the Old Masters, especially the frescoes of Raphael, and away from the movement\u2019s preoccupation with depicting scenes of modern life. By 1886, Camille Pissarro had adopted and propagated the pointillism of Georges Seurat; the demand by Pissarro that Seurat be included in the eighth (and final) Impressionist exhibition that year\u2014where he presented his masterpiece A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884 (fig. 35.2)\u2014led Monet, Renoir, and Alfred Sisley, founding members of the movement, to boycott the event. Artistically Monet responded to the challenge posed by Seurat and Neo-Impressionism by honing the Impressionist agenda. Moreover, he was motivated to stake his claim as the leader of contemporary French art, which he did by striving \u201cto prove Impressionism\u2019s superior capacity to exploit color, describe particular climatic conditions, use paint in novel ways, and reveal fundamental truths about art and the world.\u201d Nature was to serve as a particularly effective means for expressing this agenda.\n\nIn Monet\u2019s series paintings of the 1890s, the overall effects of light and atmosphere became one of his principal concerns. John House describes the \u201cever-changing enveloppe of coloured air\u201d that accompanied his pictures, subordinating while invigorating the physical objects depicted. In addition to painting multiple versions of new subjects like the facade of Rouen Cathedral, Monet began to revisit and reconsider motifs that he had painted previously. The Customs House at Varengeville provides an example of both these trends.\n\nDuring a painting campaign in Normandy in 1882, Monet executed four versions of the customs house located in Varengeville (fig. 35.3 [W735], fig. 35.4 [W736], fig. 35.5 [W737], and fig. 35.6 [W738]). The works reveal his preoccupation with issues similar to those he addressed in the Art Institute\u2019s Cliff Walk at Pourville (cat. 19 [W758]), painted the same year, also on the Channel coast. These include his experimentation with dramatic viewpoints and the manipulation of the horizon line to emphasize the expanse of the sea\u2014a challenge to the conventional construction of space in nineteenth-century landscape painting. Using juxtaposed planes of relatively flat patches of color to divide the canvas into distinct zones of earth, sea, and sky, Monet collapsed the traditional sense of recession into space. This strategy, in addition to the unconventional diagonal cropping of the cliff at bottom left, suggests the influence of Japanese prints. But despite the rather static quality of these seascapes, Monet enlivened his surfaces\u2014in true Impressionist style\u2014by adding bold, flickering brushwork to animate the pictorial elements.\n\nMonet returned to this location fifteen years later and painted another four pictures, compositionally very similar, of the same subject; the Art Institute\u2019s picture is one of this latter group. When Monet arrived at Pourville, just up the coast from the customs house, in late February 1896, the paintings from his 1882 trip to Normandy were at the front of his mind (fig. 35.7). Writing to his art dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, the artist described the comfort he felt upon revisiting the sites he had previously painted: \u201cI set myself up here several days ago, I needed to see the sea again and am enchanted to see once more so many things that I did here fifteen years ago.\u201d Monet, then in his mid-fifties, may well have felt nostalgia for the coast of Normandy, having spent his childhood in the region and having chosen sites around Sainte-Adresse as the subjects for a number of painting campaigns as a younger man (see cat. 13). Indeed, during these two trips to Normandy in February\u2013April 1896 and January\u2013April 1897 he returned to the exact motifs\u2014including the customs house\u2014that he had painted the previous decade.\n\nThe Art Institute\u2019s Customs House at Varengeville and the three other, nearly identical, views from 1897 (fig. 35.8 [W1456], fig. 35.9 [W1457], and fig. 35.10 [W1458]) share striking similarities with those he painted in 1882. In all eight paintings, the customs house is viewed from a similar angle. The well-trodden path around the house suggests that the local fishermen were still using the building for shelter and storage. As Monet had during his earlier campaign, he even included the same irregularities of the land on which the structure stands.\n\nDespite the compositional similarities between these paintings, there are significant differences. Noticeably, the abundance of vegetation in the left foreground of the 1882 pictures has been eliminated in the 1897 versions. Although this likely reflects the fact that Monet executed the 1882 works at different times of the year, the removal of this screen of foliage in 1897 allows the viewer to be immersed in the scene. Monet accentuated this by zooming in on the customs house, allowing it to occupy more of the canvas, and by using canvases larger than those employed in the 1882 works.\n\nThe 1882 customs house paintings, in addition to being smaller, also vary in size (only two are exactly the same). All four from the 1897 campaign have nearly the same dimensions; three of the four canvases are, in fact, the same standard size (no. 30 paysage) that Monet was using frequently\u2014although not exclusively\u2014in other series paintings, such as the Stacks of Wheat that he had produced just a few years earlier (see cats. 28\u201333). It is notable that Customs House at Varengeville has a warp-thread match with the Art Institute\u2019s Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281]) and another series painting, Charing Cross Bridge, London (cat. 40 [W1527]), suggesting these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric (Technical Report/Weave).\n\nPerhaps the most significant difference between the canvases from 1882 and those from 1897 is the way in which Monet conceived the relationship between sea and sky and focused on evoking, above all, the enveloppe, that \u201ctangibly, unifying atmosphere,\u201d which harmonized his pictures and helped him to achieve what he considered \u201cmore serious qualities\u201d in his art. With the exception of The Coastguard House (Rose Effect) (fig. 35.9 [W1457]), the strong horizon line that featured in the 1882 pictures has been obscured in the 1897 pictures. Furthermore, Customs House at Varengeville appears more dreamlike than his 1882 canvases, as if Monet had utilized soft brushes and blended strokes to produce a uniform, hazy cast across the entire surface of the picture. Close inspection of Customs House at Varengeville, however, reveals that this was not the case. As in his earlier pictures, Monet incorporated lively brushwork to create a textured surface throughout the canvas. The customs house itself, for example, is composed of a network of dappled brushstrokes so dense that it creates a tapestry-like effect (fig. 35.11); he also used a very active brush to build up the water and sky (fig. 35.12). Technical analysis suggests that, by and large, Monet\u2019s palette had changed very little from his earlier pictures; what is different in this painting is that the artist has narrowed his tonal range by increasing the amount of white in his paints, thereby reducing the intensity of each color. By pulling the hues closer to each other in value, Monet was able to achieve more nuanced and subdued atmospheric effects, while still utilizing vigorous brushwork.\n\nPaul Tucker has commented on the sense of introspection created by this softer palette. Rather than replicating a landscape, these pictures give the impression of being \u201cinformed as much by memory as by experience,\u201d in which the more mature Monet is \u201creflecting on his past as much as observing and transcribing specific lighting conditions.\u201d This nostalgia is on display in Customs House at Varengeville. Monet certainly began this painting out of doors sur la motif. At upper left there is at least one fiber\u2014probably plant material\u2014embedded in the paint (fig. 35.13). Monet complained of the \u201cbloody winds\u201d he experienced during his 1897 campaign, which likely led to this chance inclusion. While direct experience of the subject matter remained a critical component of Monet\u2019s practice, it is significant that areas of the final composition were executed wet-over-dry, which suggests that the artist did some reworking of the canvas in the studio, the place where Monet\u2019s memories would trump what he actually experienced on site.\n\nAlthough very few major compositional changes were made to the painting, Monet did make small adjustments to the customs house itself: he enlarged the structure by slightly extending the roof and widening the chimney. But even more significantly, he experimented with techniques that animated the painting\u2019s surface. In small areas, Monet scraped or wiped away paint to enhance its texture and expose underlying colors (see Technical Report). Microscopic imaging also indicates that this painting was initially much more vibrant in places. Portions of the water, for example, were originally laid in with bright green, and after this paint layer dried, Monet covered it with pale-gray paint to dramatically reduce the vibrancy of the initial color (fig. 35.14; see Technical Report). Monet embraced the glimpses of this underlayer that were exposed through breaks in the gray layer, however, and he further accentuated them by adding touches of a similar green color on top. In doing so, he subtly played with the three-dimensionality of the paint and showed the care with which he created perfectly harmonized surfaces that vibrate and flicker.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s The Customs House at Varengeville was painted on a pre-primed, no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size linen canvas. A photograph of the original stretcher back shows that the stretcher size was indicated by a stenciled \u201c30P.\u201d The ground is off-white and consists of a single layer. A warp-thread match was detected with two other paintings from the Art Institute\u2019s collection: Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155) and Charing Cross Bridge (cat. 40 [W1527], inv. 1933.1150), suggesting that the fabric for these paintings came from the same bolt of material. The painting was densely built up with a richly brush-marked surface. The artist appears to have locally worked back into the painting, either scraping or wiping the surface while the paint was still soft, to expose colors from the underlying layers in small areas. Flattening of the surface texture and small areas of interlayer cleavage appear to be associated with this surface treatment. To the right of the house, a fine, pointed tool was used to incise a series of vertical lines into the area of the fence. There are no major alterations to the composition, only slight adjustments along the edges of the building and the fence line. At least one fiber, possibly plant material, is embedded in the paint layer near the top left edge. This may be evidence of the execution of the work en plein air.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 35.15).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 97 (lower left, in orangish-red paint) (fig. 35.16). The underlying paint layers were dry when the painting was signed (fig. 35.17).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 65 \u00d7 92 cm. This corresponds to a no. 30 landscape (paysage) standard-size stretcher.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.4V (0.6) \u00d7 20.5H (0.7) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. A warp-thread match was found with Stack of Wheat (Snow Effect, Overcast Day) (cat. 30 [W1281], inv. 1933.1155) and Charing Cross Bridge (cat. 40, inv. 1933.1150).\n\nThere is mild, relatively even cusping along the top and bottom edges and more pronounced cusping on the left and especially the right edge.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1974 lining (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced 6\u20138 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Tack holes spaced 6\u20138 cm apart. The cusping appears to correspond to the placement of the original tack holes. A few additional holes that do not correspond to the cusping pattern were probably added later to reinforce the edges.\n\nCurrent stretcher: ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.8 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher was probably the original stretcher (fig. 35.18). An examination report in the conservation file describes the stretcher as five membered with keyable, mortise and tenon joints. The report gives the following dimensions: overall, 65.5 \u00d7 92.2 cm; outside depth, 2 cm; inside depth, 2.5 cm; stretcher-bar width, 7 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 7 cm.\n\nA photograph of the pre-1974-treatment stretcher shows a stamp on the back: 30P (fig. 35.19). This probably refers to no. 30 paysage, the standard size of the stretcher.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of the top, bottom, and left tacking margins but stops short of the right edge, leaving approximately 1 cm of unprimed canvas (fig. 35.20). This suggests that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of fabric on three of its sides. The right edge probably corresponds to the outer edge of the larger canvas that was attached to the priming frame. The canvas was probably commercially primed. Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of a single layer (fig. 35.21). Several tiny bubble holes were observed in the ground layer.\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark particles visible under magnification (fig. 35.22).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white and calcium carbonate (chalk) with traces of iron oxide, alumina, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting has a richly brush-marked surface that was built up using a network of superimposed strokes of thick, textural paint and low impasto (fig. 35.23). Where visible through breaks in the upper brushwork, the earliest paint layers, used to lay in the general undertone of the house and garden, consist of light shades of dull pinkish-brown and gray (fig. 35.24, fig. 35.25). These initial paint layers were thinly applied and where they are exposed at the surface, the texture of the canvas weave remains prominent (fig. 35.26). The sky and especially the water, on the other hand, were more densely built up, as evidenced by the relative radio-opacity of these areas in the X-ray (fig. 35.27). The density of the paint in these areas makes it more difficult to see how the sky and the water were laid in. The upper layers of the water consist of thick wet-in-wet applications of paint (fig. 35.28). The sky was built up in shades of pale blue and gray. Much of the surface texture comes from underlying strokes that were allowed to surface dry before being painted over. This includes several short, diagonal dabs of the brush where the paint was pulled up in low peaks, creating a distinct pattern in the left half of the sky (fig. 35.29).\n\nIn several localized areas throughout the water, it appears that the artist scraped the upper paint surface, exposing small areas of underlying colors. This can be seen in the area underneath the fence on the left side of the house, where some of the deep-gray underlayer is visible at the surface (fig. 35.30). Associated interlayer cleavage\u2014where tiny islands of paint have separated from the paint layer underneath\u2014suggests that the lower paint layer was at least surface dry when the pale-green paint was applied on top, resulting in poor adhesion between the layers (fig. 35.31). The cleavage seems to have occurred while Monet was still working on the painting, since subsequent brushstrokes, which were applied wet-over-dry and appear to be original, can be seen to pass over the losses (fig. 35.32). In the water and in the pale-gray areas closest to the foreground, bright-green paint is exposed from underneath (fig. 35.33). The bright green was mostly covered by the thick, pale gray strokes worked on top and then revealed in small areas through scraping. Similar scraping and flattening of the texture of the soft paint layers was also observed in the stonework of the house. No tool marks were evident in these areas, making it difficult to know precisely how Monet achieved this effect; however, in the area of the fence directly right of the house (fig. 35.34), a fine, pointed implement was used to incise a series of parallel, vertical lines through the wet paint layers of the water (fig. 35.35). The strokes of purple paint in this area were later drawn lightly across the dry surface, mostly skipping over the troughs of the vertical incisions (fig. 35.36).\n\nNo major alterations were made to the composition. Some small adjustments were made to the edges of the house and the landscape as the painting was built up. For example, the dimensions of the house appear to have initially been slightly smaller (fig. 35.37). This can be seen along the front left and back right diagonal slopes of the roof, where the water was painted in underneath the edges of the roof; the roof was then extended in both places over the water when that paint was already dry (fig. 35.38). The overhanging eave on the far left side of the building was originally longer. The artist then touched out the very end of it using a pale-green paint, which has a slightly different tone than the adjacent water (fig. 35.39, fig. 35.40). The chimney was also expanded around the edges by adding strokes of paint over the already-dry pale-green strokes from the water (fig. 35.41). The upper edge of the diagonal part of the fence and border of foliage on the right side was also modified slightly (fig. 35.42). The purplish-gray strokes of grass that extend over the water near the back-right corner of the garden were added later when the paint of the water was dry (fig. 35.43), unlike the grass along the adjacent horizontal portion of the fence, which was applied wet-in-wet with the water (fig. 35.44).\n\nThere is at least one fiber, possibly plant material, embedded in the paint layer at the upper-left edge (fig. 35.45). This was incorporated while the artist was working on the painting, as it is partially covered by original paint. A few short black fibers were also observed around the signature (fig. 35.46), possibly from material having been pressed against the paint surface when it was still wet. A light, intermittent impression or disturbance in the wet paint is visible along the top edge. It is approximately 48 cm long and centered at approximately 2.5 cm from the top edge (fig. 35.47). A similar impression was also observed along the bottom edge, in roughly the same centered position. Subsequent brushwork passes over the areas of disturbed paint, indicating that they occurred at some point during the execution of the work. The marks could have been caused by an easel cleat or transport case. Some flattened paint around the edges of the composition appears to be the result of framing while the paint was still soft.\n\nBrushes including 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet. PLM analysis also indicates the possible presence of bone black. The presence of a bright orangish-pink fluorescence under UV suggests that the artist used red lake throughout the building and the landscape. There are large white agglomerates in some of the paint mixtures.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting was cleaned in 2010 and left unvarnished (see Conservation History). The painting has a soft, variable surface depending on the qualities of the paint application.\n\nIn 1960, the back of the painting was vacuumed and the stretcher keys were fixed with masking tape. Metal strip molding was attached around the edges, and a fiberboard backing was applied. The paint surface was cleaned with a wax emulsion.\n\nIn 1974, the varnish was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched onto an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Minimal inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 2010, the synthetic varnish layers were removed and the painting was left unvarnished.\n\nThe painting is in good condition overall. It is wax-resin lined and stretched taut and in plane on an ICA spring stretcher. The dimensions are slightly larger than those of the original stretcher, resulting in the incorporation of unpainted ground around the edges of the composition. There is minor wear and abrasion of the ground layer on the tacking margins and some light abrasion of paint near the original foldovers. There are some light scratches and impressions in the paint layer in the upper left corner, as well as several embedded brush hairs and plant fibers, all of which occurred while the paint was still wet or soft. Translucent protrusions were observed microscopically throughout the paint surface (fig. 35.48). There are a few small, isolated areas of paint loss and interlayer cleavage in the sky. These areas are secure. In other areas of the painting, interlayer cleavage appears to be related to scraping or rubbing of the paint surface as part of the artist\u2019s working method (see Application/Technique). Mechanical cracking is minimal and very fine. There are light stretcher-bar cracks in the area of the original vertical stretcher members and crossbar. Localized drying cracks were observed in some of the yellow brushstrokes, which may be related to the pigments used (fig. 35.49). The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 1995): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an American, mid-twentieth-century, wedge-profile, molding frame with beaded outer edge and white cove sight edge and an independent linen-faced liner with a gilded sight. The frame is both water and oil gilded over red bole on gesso; the sight cove is exposed gesso. The gilding is heavily toned with a gray overwash and gray and dark flecking. The basswood molding is mitered and nailed. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is flat sides with a beveled return; fillet with centered cast beading; hollow; wedge face; fillet; cove; and an independent linen-covered fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 35.50).\n\nPrevious frame (original to the picture and removed in 1995; currently the frame is on Monet, Stack of Wheat [Snow Effect, Overcast Day] cat. 30): This frame was original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), late-nineteenth-century, Durand-Ruel R\u00e9gence Revival, ogee frame with cast foliate and center cartouches and fillet liner. The frame is both water and oil gilded. Red-brown bole was used on the perimeter, cast foliate ornament on the face and sight molding, and the liner. Red bole was used for the scotia sides. The gilding was applied directly to the plaster on the ogee face in the crosshatched areas between the ornament. The quadrillage face has been rubbed to bring out the white of the plaster. The frame has an overall bronze tone with casein or gouache raw umber and gray washes. The frame has a glued pine substrate with a cast plaster face. At a later date the original back of the frame was planed flat, removing all construction history and provenance. A back frame was then glued to the back. All back and interior surfaces have been overpainted. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is fillet with stylized cast dovetail-pierced egg-and-flower molding; scotia side; ogee face with a cast quadrillage bed and center and corner foliate and floral cartouches with cabochon centers on a double-lined diamond bed with punched centers; fillet; sanded front frieze; fillet; ogee with stylized leaf-tip-and-shell sight molding; and independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 35.51).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Galerie Allard et Noel, Feb. 1899, for 6,000 francs.\n\nAcquired by Maurice Masson, Paris, by Feb. 27, 1911.\n\nSold at the Maurice Masson, Paris, sale, H\u00f4tel Drouot, Paris, June 22, 1911, lot 23, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, for 9,020 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, July 21, 1913 or Aug. 6, 1913.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (normal light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains vermilion, viridian, and cobalt blue; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Customs\\_33\\_1149\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 16, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1149\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers. Small discrepancies between the current dimensions and standard sizes may be a result of this approximation, as well as other factors such as restretching of the painting on a new stretcher after lining.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, The Customs House at Varengeville (W1455/1933.1149),\u201d Nov. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that these canvases were cut from the same bolt of fabric. See Don H. Johnson, \u201cWeave Match Report: Claude Monet, W1281, W1455, W1527,\u201d Apr. 2011. For further discussion, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H.

The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1149\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1149\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_Results,\" Nov. 20, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Customs\\_33\\_1149\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 16, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThese strokes occur in two roughly parallel, horizontal lines in the left half of the sky. It is possible that they were used as a way of delineating the horizon or the different color bands of the sea. Similar strokes occur along the left edge of the roof, where they appear to be related to short diagonal strokes in the water that were brought just to the edge of the roof.\n\nIn addition, the edges of the losses often appear soft, suggesting that the paint was still somewhat fluid when the losses occurred.\n\nThis perhaps provides tangible evidence of Monet having worked on the painting outdoors. Additional fibers may be present but completely embedded in the paint. Similar fibers were observed in Monet\u2019s Stacks of Wheat (Sunset, Snow Effect) (cat. 29 [W1278], inv. 1922.431) and Poppy Field (cat. 26 [W1253], inv. 1922.4465). The numbers preceded by a W refer to the Monet catalogue raisonn\u00e9; see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet: Catalogue raisonn\u00e9/Werkverzeichnis, vols. 1\u20134 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996).\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, cobalt violet (PLM, XRF); chrome yellow, red lake, ultramarine blue, possible bone black (PLM). PLM analysis highlighted the presence of pale-red and deeper-red particles of red lake, suggesting that two different types may be present. Paint scrapings taken in 1974 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1149\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d June 9, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1933\\_1149\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_Results,\" Nov. 20, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Customs\\_33\\_1149\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 16, 2010, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed. Elisabeth West FitzHugh, vol. 3 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1997), pp. 124\u201326. See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
