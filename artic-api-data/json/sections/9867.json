Over half the firm\u2019s 303 entries in the exposition were from this line, whose name refers to its hand-hammered finish and derives from the French verb marteler (to hammer). This visual evidence of the silversmith\u2019s hand, along with Art Nouveau\u2019s curvaceous, undulating forms and decorations, were enhanced by the company\u2019s use of .950 fine silver, which is more malleable than .925 sterling silver. Although William Christmas Codman, Gorham\u2019s chief designer since 1891, had begun to create work in the Art Nouveau style just a year after the 1893 Chicago World\u2019s Columbian Exposition, the first official piece of Martel\u00e9 was a three-handled loving cup that appeared in late 1896 and was entered into the Makers and Finished Weights Ledger on November 21 of that year.\n\nMartel\u00e9 was difficult and painstaking to produce, requiring that designers possess the dexterity to adapt two-dimensional drawings to three-dimensional realizations, a feat often requiring an insightful reading of sketchy renderings. To facilitate this demanding process, Codman formed a special training school for Gorham silversmiths working on this line; they were able to produce a quantity of Martel\u00e9 substantial enough to show first at the 1897 Boston Arts and Crafts Exhibition and again that same year at the Waldorf Hotel in New York. A review in Jewelers\u2019 Circular underscores the challenge of translating the design into physical form: \u201cWhile the designs are generally from one man, W. C. Codman . . . the articles themselves were wrought under his direction by different skilled silver workers, and show to a considerable extent the individuality of the makers.\u201d Three years later, Gorham chose the 1900 Paris Exposition as the venue for the official international launch of Martel\u00e9, achieving sweeping success. The centerpiece of the debut was a solid silver dressing table and stool wrought from 78 pounds of silver over the course of 2,300 hundred hours of labor. Gorham\u2019s showing in Paris, consisting of around 154 gold and silver items comprising about 300 individual objects, garnered great success, winning the grand prize for metalwork as well as gold and silver medals, while the company president Edward Holbrook was made a Chevalier of the French Legion of Honor.\n\nThe year 1900 also marked the twenty-fifth wedding anniversary of Charles Henry Aldrich (1850\u20131929) and Helen Urania Roberts Aldrich (1853\u20131921). Charles commissioned the service for Helen in honor of the occasion, as indicated by the engraved inscription 1875 / OCTOBER THIRTEENTH 1900. Hailing from a family that had lived in Rhode Island and Massachusetts since the seventeenth century, Charles Aldrich in 1886 established a law practice in Chicago, which he maintained until he was appointed U.S. solicitor general six years later. The service also bears the mark of Spaulding &amp; Co., one of Chicago\u2019s most prestigious jewelers at the time; indeed, Spaulding debuted the Martel\u00e9 line in the United States, and later in its Paris shop which opened in 1887.\n\nThe coffeepot, cream pitcher, and sugar bowl were special orders, nos. 556\u201358 in Gorham\u2019s costing ledger. This records a completion date of September 29, 1900; a net cost of $280; and the efforts of silversmith Herbert C. Lloyd, who spent 122 hours making the service and ninety-five hours chasing it. Although possessing the same honorific engraving as the coffeepot, sugar, and cream pitcher, the tray\u2019s date in the records is July 15, 1901. The tray, or waiter, was special order BBS, requiring twenty-five hours of fabricating and twenty-five hours of chasing by George W. Sauthof, who trained at Tiffany &amp; Co., only to be hired away by Gorham in 1884. Sauthof, who remained at the company until his death in 1927, became one of the most highly acclaimed Martel\u00e9 chasers in the ranks, praised as \u201cone of the greatest repouss\u00e9 artists in the craft.\u201d That he was also an accomplished gardener is evidenced by the adeptly rendered floral decorations that gracefully ornament the tray\u2019s softly undulating border.  \nElizabeth A.
