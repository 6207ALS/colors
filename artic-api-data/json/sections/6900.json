In 1848 founder Jabez Gorham left the business to his son John, who had joined the company in 1841 with ambitious plans for expansion and modernization. In 1850 the company changed its name to Gorham &amp; Thurber to reflect the addition of John\u2019s cousin, Gorham Thurber, which allowed John to focus on \u201cthe improvement of our machinery and tools, and especially [on] the introduction of Hollow Ware as Dinner &amp; Tea Services, etc.\u201d Gorham &amp; Thurber chose to debut its new creations at the Rhode Island State Fair in 1850, where, the Providence Journal observed, \u201cthe tea and coffee sets are superbly elegant, perfect in design and execution and reflect the highest credit upon the manufacturers.\u201d Recognizing the city\u2019s first specimens of locally produced hollowware, the reporter noted that the \u201cwealth of our city will see that it need not go abroad for the most luxurious ornaments for the table. Providence has long been distinguished by its manufacture of . . . silver ware; but hollow ware of silver has not, we believe, been before attempted here.\u201d\n\nBuilding upon its success, Gorham presented at the 1851 Rhode Island State Fair its most elaborate hollowware to date. The company\u2019s Chinese tea service received first place in the department of \u201cthe graceful arts\u201d and was given the fullest description in a Providence Journal article characterizing it as a \u201cnew and elegant model . . . fully chased, the body being surrounded by a succession of scenes peculiar to China, which are exquisitely rendered. The feet, spout, etc., are formed of the tea plant, bearing leaves, buds and blossoms . . . the effect of the whole is in the highest degree ornate and graceful (fig. 47.1).\u201d\n\nThe service was designed by a New York silversmith who created the drawings and fashioned the wax models for applied elements for the firm\u2019s craftsmen to execute in silver; according to John Gorham, the service took an unusually long time to complete. A drawing by Providence engravers Thompson &amp; Crosby accompanied the newspaper article and was subsequently used by Gorham in an 1852 advertisement (see fig. 47.2) illustrating part of the service, which was praised in the press for its \u201cextreme elegance of design and finished workmanship.\u201d\n\nThe characterization of the 1851 Chinese service evokes the effect of the naturalistic branches bearing the flowers and foliage of the tea plant that wind around the Art Institute service\u2019s cast crabstock handles and spouts, and malleably loop to form the feet of all the vessels. Provenance, along with the inscription on the kettle, dates the Art Institute\u2019s set to the year before, 1850, when it was made for Emily Mandeville Almy (1827\u20131923), as indicated by the EMA and Almy engraved on either side of the vessels. She married Benjamin Rathbone Almy (1810\u20131861) on November 15, 1849, and the couple initially resided in Providence.\n\nThe elaborately wrought repouss\u00e9 and chased scenes that cover the objects\u2019 hand-raised, melon-shaped bodies tend to suggest their likely contents. The milk pot and the cream pot feature a cow, a barn, and a woman carrying a milk pail on her head; the teapot and the waste bowl are adorned with chinoiserie imagery of a hatted Asian figure carrying a parasol; a similar figure seated in a boat sailing in a pool, indicated by deftly formed hammer marks; and banks lushly populated with palms and exotic plants. The sugar bowl depicts a man tending a field of sugarcane. These vignettes are framed by the overhanging branches of tall trees, which also form the organic cartouches enclosing the engraved monogram and surname.\n\nKnown as Rococo Revival, the service\u2019s style reflects America\u2019s interest in the historicized aesthetics of eighteenth-century French Rococo, which melds asymmetrical and sinuous undulations of form with abundant floral flourishes, as well as Chinese-influenced scenes of Asian figures and architectural elements. This style was adopted by silver firms nationwide as early as the 1830s, becoming widespread from 1840 to 1860 in cities such as New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and especially Baltimore. In addition to French chinoiserie, imported Asian porcelain, lacquer, wallpaper, and silver provided inspiration for these profusely decorated wares. The height of Chinese export silver spanned the 1840s to the 1870s, with most known examples found in New England, a result of these states\u2019 strong involvement with the China trade beginning in the late eighteenth century. Moving away from Western-influenced style that had been observed since the turn of the eighteenth century, Chinese export silver returned to the copiously ornamented examples made as early as the late seventeenth century with characteristic repouss\u00e9 compositional scenes and finials, handles, spouts, and feet cast as branches, vines, and dragons. It is therefore not surprising to see American silver that combines chinoiserie elements with motifs that glorify the natural wonders of the United States and celebrate the young country.  \nElizabeth A.
