The movements and poses of studio models had long captivated the artist, and his sketches of them punctuate his work as far back as the 1860s (see Draped Model, cat. 10; and, from the following decade, A Nude Figure, cat. 18). The works from this earlier period functioned primarily as studies for larger compositions or as creative stimuli tacked up around the studio for personal use. By the mid-1890s, however, Whistler viewed his newer meditations on this theme as completed works worthy of public recognition, and he exhibited and sold them accordingly.\n\nWhistler rendered this subject in chalk, pastel, watercolor, oil, and lithography, sometimes combining materials to achieve the desired effect. Green and Blue: The Dancer (cat. 31) and The Little Blue Cap (cat. 32) are both composed of transparent and opaque watercolor, overlaying restrained black outlines drawn in chalk or charcoal. Whistler approached them in much the same way as he did his pastels, applying the colors in thin but distinct layers while leaving portions of his favored brown paper visible beneath. The pictures show the artist in utter control of his medium, masterfully manipulating his watercolors to suggest the models\u2019 features and to create the illusion of gossamer fabric skimming lightly over the contours of their bodies. A comparison of cat. 31 and cat. 32 demonstrates how effectively the subtle tonal differences of the brown papers could be harnessed to alter the visual impact of a work. The lighter paper used for Green and Blue: The Dancer adds warmth to the wash of green and of blue, while the darker tint of The Little Blue Cap\u2019s support brings a coolness to the prevailing pinks of the robe, the model\u2019s skin, and the curtain behind her head. The brightly colored cap in each provides a colorful focus that contrasts with the dominant hue of each composition, augmenting the warming or cooling effect of the paper.\n\nIn both Green and Blue: The Dancer and The Little Blue Cap, Whistler depicted his models clothed in loose, diaphanous drapery with their hair tied up under brightly colored caps. These allusively classical garments recall Whistler\u2019s early interest in ancient Greek and Roman art, as well as his lifelong association with Albert Joseph Moore and other proponents of British Aestheticism. The static but graceful pose of the model in The Little Blue Cap is especially evocative of the ancient Greek Tanagra figurines that were enthusiastically collected in Europe in the second half of the nineteenth century (see, for comparison, a statuette acquired by the British Museum in 1875; fig. 31\u201332.1). Like many of his colleagues, Whistler greatly admired Tanagras, and he kept an album of photographs of those owned by his friend Alexander Ionides. He would have also been aware of examples of dancing terra-cotta figures, such as the well-known Danseuse Titeux in the Louvre\u2019s collection (fig. 31\u201332.2).\n\nThe watercolors\u2019 flat planes of vibrant color, their celebration of the decorative, and their use of props such as flowers and fans also link them to Whistler\u2019s long-standing regard for Japanese and Chinese art. Employing what was, by this point in his career, a characteristic visual strategy, the artist blended Eastern and Western sources in an effort to define his images in purely aesthetic terms. In this sense, these late images of studio models continue along the same trajectory as much of his previous work.\n\nTo these familiar motifs, Whistler added fresh emphases. Alongside the stationary postures shown in pictures from this period such as The Little Blue Cap are numerous examples of nimble bodies in motion comparable to Green and Blue: The Dancer. Whistler\u2019s interest in capturing the graceful movements of his models was likely sparked by the innovative photography of Eadweard Muybridge, whose groundbreaking images of humans and animals engaged in progressive actions presented dynamic physical activity in a static visual form (fig. 31\u201332.3). Indeed, Whistler\u2019s name was included on a list of subscribers to Muybridge\u2019s seminal Animal Locomotion (1887), published in a revised edition in 1891. Whistler was also inspired by the hypnotic dancing of Lo\u00efe Fuller, whose free-flowing style and billowing costumes garnered high praise in Europe following her theatrical debut in Paris in late 1892 (fig. 31\u201332.4). The artist saw Fuller perform, and reproduced her whirling gestures in an exuberant sketch (fig. 31\u201332.5; M 1346). Complemented by Whistler\u2019s bravura brushwork, this focus on dynamic form vitalizes the balletic stance of the model in Green and Blue: The Dancer as well as the more fixed, yet sinuous, pose of the model in The Little Blue Cap.\n\nWhistler\u2019s recent friendship with the Symbolist writer St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, who shared the artist\u2019s fascination with the poetic qualities of dance and the symbolic potential of the female form, also informed these works. Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s poem \u201cBillet \u00e0 Whistler\u201d (\u201cLetter to Whistler\u201d), written in 1890, even takes as its subject a dancer who wields her skirt like a fan before the artist. Like Mallarm\u00e9\u2019s subtle poetry, Green and Blue: The Dancer and The Little Blue Cap suggest a deeper meaning beyond the seemingly straightforward depictions of their female subjects. In Whistler\u2019s images, the empty space of the studio is transformed into a charged realm of pure artistic expression, with the individual qualities of the models subsumed by the aesthetic harmony produced in the blending of human form, color, and line. Set apart from the world and completely absorbed by their activity, the figures become idealized manifestations of the creative process itself. As Mallarm\u00e9 described it, Whistler\u2019s work, \u201cintuitive, eternal, renders the secret of beauty.\u201d The result was so compelling to Charles Lang Freer, one of Whistler\u2019s most discerning patrons, that when his friend Richard Canfield put his collection of works by the artist\u2013\u2013including Green and Blue: The Dancer\u2013\u2013up for sale, Freer expressed his hope that \u201cthe lovely little \u2018Dancer\u2019 in blue and green\u201d would fall into \u201csympathetic hands,\u201d for \u201c[s]he is altogether too entrancing to be cared for by the ordinary collector.\u201d\n\nTogether with the other pictures of studio models produced in the late 1880s and 1890s, Green and Blue: The Dancer and The Little Blue Cap in many ways represent a culmination of Whistler\u2019s artistic explorations up to this point in his career. Not only do the works synthesize old and new sources of inspiration, but they also imbue a favorite motif with deeper symbolic resonance. Modest in scale, they are nevertheless ambitious, demonstrating the artist\u2019s mastery of his materials. Evolving directly out of familiar practices, they communicate Whistler\u2019s commitment to innovation in his art making.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Green and Blue: The Dancer corresponds to Margaret F.

The original tone of each paper may therefore have affected the appearance of the compositions differently in Whistler\u2019s lifetime than they do now.\n\nFor more on the scope and history of Whistler\u2019s photograph collection, see Nigel Thorp, \u201cStudies in Black and White: Whistler\u2019s Photographs in Glasgow University Library,\u201d Studies in the History of Art 19, Symposium Papers VI: James McNeill Whistler: A Reexamination (1987): 85\u2013100.\n\nThe Danseuse Titeux terra-cotta figurine entered the Louvre\u2019s collection in 1891. It actually predates Tanagra figurines, and thus cannot accurately be termed a \u201cTanagra,\u201d but was believed to be one in the nineteenth century. Images and reproductions of the Danseuse Titeux were widely distributed in the second half of the nineteenth century. In his entry on the statuette for the catalogue of the Louvre\u2019s 2004 exhibition Tanagra: Mythe et arch\u00e9ologie, Edouard Papet designates the Danseuse Titeux \u201cla terre cuite grecque antique la plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bre en France au XIXe si\u00e8cle\u201d (the most famous Ancient Greek terra-cotta in France in the nineteenth century). Writing in 1900, Marcus Huish reported that \u201c[r]eproductions of it had been seen and published in almost every country.\u201d See Edouard Papet, \u201cVariations sur la Danseuse Titeux,\u201d in Tanagra: Mythe et arch\u00e9ologie, ed. Violaine Jeammet, exh. cat. (Paris: R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux; Montr\u00e9al: Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Montr\u00e9al, 2003), 54; Marcus B. Huish, Greek Terra-Cotta Statuettes: Their Origin, Evolution, and Uses (London: John Murray, 1900), 91. For more on the history of the Danseuse Titeux and its widespread popularity in the nineteenth century, see Jeammet, Tanagra: Mythe et arch\u00e9ologie, 37, 54\u201359, 146\u201347.

Stratis and Martha Tedeschi (Chicago: Art Institute of Chicago, 1998), 1:109 (Lochnan identifies the statuette by Huish\u2019s title, Veiled Dancer).\n\nAs noted by Martha Tedeschi, Whistler was listed as one of Animal Locomotion\u2019s subscribers in the 1891 prospectus for the publication. See Eadweard Muybridge, The Science of Animal Locomotion (Zoopraxography): An Electro-Photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements (1887; rev. ed., Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1891), 21; Martha Tedeschi, \u201cIn the Studio,\u201d \u201cSongs on Stone: James McNeill Whistler and the Art of Lithography,\u201d special issue, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 24, no. 1, (1998): 61. For more information on Muybridge and the publication of Animal Locomotion, see Robert Bartlett Haas, Muybridge: Man in Motion (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976), 153\u201358.\n\nLo\u00efe Fuller first performed in Europe at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in Paris on November 5, 1892. For more information on Fuller\u2019s debut in Paris, see Giovanni Lista, Lo\u00efe Fuller: Danseuse de la Belle \u00c9poque (Paris: \u00c9ditions Stock, 1994), 111\u201345.\n\nWhistler almost certainly attended one of Fuller\u2019s first performances, for in November or December 1892 the American art collector Isabella Stewart Gardner wrote to him, requesting that he show her \u201cthe whirling tracings of Loie Fuller that you pencilled,\u201d likely referring to a sheet now in the collection of the Hunterian Art Gallery, University of Glasgow. See Isabella Stewart Gardner to Whistler, repr. in The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler, 1855\u20131903, ed. Margaret F. MacDonald, Patricia de Montfort, and Nigel Thorp, online edition (Glasgow, UK: University of Glasgow, 2003\u201310), hereafter GUW, no. 01641; and, for the drawing, MacDonald (1995), 484\u201385 (cat. 1346).\n\nThe friendship between Whistler and Mallarm\u00e9 was kindled during a lunch arranged by the artist Claude Monet in 1888. However, the two had met at least once before, and were probably first introduced by the art critic Th\u00e9odore Duret. See Correspondance Mallarm\u00e9-Whistler: Histoire de la grande amiti\u00e9 de leurs derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, ed. Carl Paul Barbier (Paris: A. G. Nizet, 1964), 5\u20138.
