In the Art Institute's first-ever exhibition devoted to the Spanish Surrealist, we explore the pivotal period of the 1930s when the artist developed his unique persona and distinct brand of Surrealism, full of double visions, two-way imagery, and disappearing acts.</p><h2>About the Speaker</h2><p>We encourage you to <strong>visit the exhibition before the lecture, if possible</strong>.
