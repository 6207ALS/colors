    "description": "<p>Wu Tsang (born 1982) is a performance artist and award-winning filmmaker whose practice considers intersections, overlaps, and conflicts of identity and community. Working both independently and with frequent collaborators such as poet Fred Moten and performance artist boychild, Tsang intertwines documentary practice and narrative fiction into critical analyses of hegemonic structures and explorations of nonconformity within queer and transgender communities.</p><p>Presented by the <a href=\"/join-and-give/affiliate-groups/society-contemporary-art\">Society for Contemporary Art</a></p>",
