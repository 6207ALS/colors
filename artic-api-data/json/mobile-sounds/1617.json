    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This wonderfully spontaneous seeming circus scene featuring a ringmaster and female equestrian was painted by Toulouse-Lautrec onto the leather skin of a tambourine. It was undoubtedly created around the same time as his celebrated large scale painting of the same subject, also hanging in this gallery. Here the tambourine shape allows Toulouse-Lautrec to experiment with the truly radical composition, and as with his poster art, to work outside the fine arts tradition of oil painting on canvas. As we look through its circular outer edge it takes on the form of the hoop. It\u2019s as if the woman had just jumped and has landed again on the horse\u2019s back, her limbs and costume a blur of swiftly brushed lines. Although we don\u2019t know what prompted him to take on this instrument associated with Spanish dancers and bohemian life, the artist may have made this painting for the Caf\u00e9 Tambourin in Montmartre. The caf\u00e9\u2019s decor was entirely themed around the tambourine motif, with tables and chair shaped to resemble them, and real versions hung on the walls.</p>\n",
