    "description": "<p>Art Shay is one of Chicago\u2019s great photojournalists. With more than 25,000 published photographs\u2014including more than 1,000 magazine covers\u2014Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.</p>\n<p>Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs\u2014of an American military air disaster\u2014were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine <em>Look.</em> After the war, he joined <em>Time</em> and <em>Life</em> magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay\u2019s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.</p>\n<p>Of particular significance in Shay\u2019s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909\u20131981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city\u2019s down-and-out, and the photographer\u2019s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.<br>\u2014 Permanent collection label</p>\n<p>\u201cNelson Algren\u2019s addiction to poker, Chicago\u2019s greatest litterateur Herman Kogan and I agreed, cost three, perhaps as many as five unwritten novels. Early on, I\u2019d let Nelson enlist me in one of his poker games. I felt like a sheep about to be shorn by a posse of herders\u2014and I was. They were small stakes games. With Nelson and his friends I would stumble and grumble\u2014and usually drop 10 to 20 bucks\u2014while Algren averaged losses of $5 to $10. It was pleasure in the game itself that he got for his money. One night I was being dealt by Bill Hackett of Saint Louis\u2014the original Frankie Machine of Algren\u2019s The Man with the Golden Arm (immortalized by Frank Sinatra in Otto Preminger\u2019s film version of the novel). Hackett, Nelson explained, was both a card dealer and a drug dealer. \u201cHe plays and deals to support his habit.\u201d\u2019<br>\u2014Art Shay</p>\n",
