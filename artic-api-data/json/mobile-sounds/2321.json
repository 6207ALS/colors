    "transcript": "<p>GLORIA GROOM: So here we\u2019re looking at a vase of sorts but it\u2019s a vase that\u2019s very-- it\u2019s almost like a painting in the round. It\u2019s the myth of Leda and the Swan where Zeus transforms himself into a swan and seduces a young woman. Here the swan looks a little like a goose and that makes sense, given that Gauguin was already painting the Bretons and geese of the Brittany region. The swan\u2019s neck becomes the handle for the vessel. It\u2019s wonderfully articulate and, at the same time, very organic because you have-- you walk around, you see that it is a painting that moves with you. You can\u2019t really figure out where is the front and where is the back, because it\u2019s all part of the continuous motion.</p>\n<p>ALLISON PERELMAN: He wasn\u2019t just looking to contemporary sources for inspiration. Gaugin was looking at Brittany, he was looking at other exotic sources, but he was looking to classical mythology as well. He did not discriminate in terms of what inspired him. He was willing to take inspiration anywhere.</p>\n<p>GLORIA GROOM: And you see Leda. You see this young girl in a large preparatory drawing for a painting and then you see her again as the cover image for the album of zincographs that he did in 1889 on this bright canary yellow paper. So obviously this was a motif that meant something to Gauguin, and, as he did with the motifs that he valued, he repeated it with different materials, and of course, having different meanings.</p>\n",
