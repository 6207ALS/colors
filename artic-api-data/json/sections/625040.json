Pattern-molded, blown, trail decorated, and tooled. The rim, rounded by reheating, sits on a wide, long, straight-sided, inward-tapering neck. At the base of the neck, the vessel wall constricts slightly before spreading out into a convex shoulder and slightly swelling body. The sides of the vessel taper toward the flattened base that is kicked on the underside and retains what appears to be a very small pontil mark. The body is pattern molded with spiral ribs, the neck divided into roughly equal thirds by two applied horizontal trails. For a zoomable image, see fig. 128.1.\n\nThere is a small repair in the shoulder; some light-brown incrustation and patches of milky weathering product adhere to the surface, especially along a spiraling strain crack on the neck. There is a slight overall iridescence.\n\nThis is an excellent example of a large serving and storage vessel produced in the later eastern Roman Empire.\n\nSuch bottles were made at the fourth-century glass factory at Jalame in Israel. In the Franciscan Museum in Nazareth are close parallels, a pattern-molded body with trail decoration on the neck from Beit Ras and two more with tooled ribbing from Beit She\u2019an and Umm Keis. There are related but slightly later undecorated bottles found in the North Cemetery at Samaria, fourth or fifth century. An intact undecorated example of this slightly later form is in the Princeton University Art Museum.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">See Weinberg and Goldstein, \u201cGlass Vessels,\u201d pp. 70\u201372, nos. 272\u201383, for globular bottles with conical necks.\n\nBagatti, \u201cI vetri del Museo Francescano di Nazaret,\u201d p. 229, fig. 4, no. 103, from Beit Ras; fig. 3, no. 78, from Beit She\u2019an; no. 82, from Umm Keis; p. 227, fig. 2, no. 57, the body of a bottle with the same sloping shoulder and sharply tapering vessel wall, also from Beit She\u2019an.\n\nCrowfoot, Crowfoot, and Kenyon, Objects from Samaria, pp. 410\u201312, fig. 95, nos. 4 and 9.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 161, no. 228, of which the rim and neck suggest the later date of the fourth or fifth century A.D.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Cat. 128 Bottle, late 3rd/4th century A.D.\n\nfig. 128.1 Bottle (late 3rd/4th century A.D.).
