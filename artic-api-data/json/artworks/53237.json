    "description": "<p>Kay Sage depicted a large, two-pronged structure resembling drapery, which rises straight up into the air from a ramp or dock that recedes into the distance at right and is punctuated by geometric and curvilinear forms. The striking canvas suggests the mystifying environs of a dreamscape, reflecting Sage\u2019s fascination with the unconscious. In the mid-1930s, the artist lived in Paris and worked alongside French Surrealists, including Yves Tanguy, whom she married in 1940 after moving to New York at the outbreak of World War II. Painted in 1944, <em>In the Third Sleep</em> attests to her continued investigation of the otherworldly.</p>\n",
