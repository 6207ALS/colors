    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  This stone statue carved in the thirteenth or fourteenth century comes from Tomal Nadu in southern Indian. It depicts one of the most beloved deities in the pantheon of Hindu gods, one that is perhaps best known as the destroyer of the universe. Madhuvanti Ghose:</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: What we see here is the great god Shiva but in his aspect of Ardhanarishvara which means the lord who is half male half female. You see, for example, his matted locks, you see the almost ascetic garb that he wears and he\u2019s accompanied by this bull, Nandi. But what is curious about the sculpture is the fact that you see a breast protruding from the torso signifying the aspect of Shiva who is one with this consort Parvati. That is Parvti\u2019s breast that you\u2019re seeing. She holds a lotus flower in her raised hand.  While Shiva might have held a trident in his raised upper hand, you see that Shiva is wearing a short loin cloth, while Parvati is wearing a longer garment which comes just above her ankles.<br>Narrator:  By merging him harmoniously with Parvati who embodies fertility, this depiction expresses Shiva\u2019s multifaceted nature including destroyer, ascetic and great lover.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: When they come together they create the ideal union. And it\u2019s said that Parvati meditated for many, many, many years in order to win Shiva. And when you bless an Indian couple after they get married you always wish that they have a union as happy as that of Shiva and Parvati.</p>\n",
