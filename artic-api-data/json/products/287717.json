    "description": "A fascinating view of the career of Bridget Riley, one of the most significant living artists, through her personal archive of her own works on paper<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Devoted exclusively to the artist\u2019s works on paper, Bridget Riley Drawings: From the Artist\u2019s Studio explores the importance of these works not only as a means of visual experimentation but as works of art in their own right. Throughout her working life, Riley has preserved works of particular significance, creating an archive that records her constant artistic inquiry and development. The studies presented in the book are drawn entirely from this personal collection, with Riley\u2019s own input. They demonstrate the artist\u2019s progression from early figurative works, through the monochrome geometry of the 1960s, to the examination of color that has characterized the second half of her long career. The choice of work explores the themes that have absorbed Riley in different periods and highlights key influences: the importance of life drawing to her and the significance of artists such as Seurat and Mondrian. The book illustrates\u2014literally and figuratively\u2014the story of a productive and constantly experimental career, underpinned by drawing.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Edited by Jay A.
