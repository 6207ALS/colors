    "description": "<p>This smart and whimsical portrait of the inhabitants of a town reveals the joys of discovering what makes each person unique and extraordinary.\u00a0Nico lives in a small coastal town, a place like any other, with ordinary neighbors and friends. But are they really ordinary? As Nico meanders\u00a0through his town he introduces readers to his friends. There's Josean, who works on the docks and who could be an Olympic rower. Peru recites all\u00a0different kinds of poetry to his son. Nico's best friend, Telmo, is skateboarder with a wild imagination. Eva plays a mean jazz guitar and gives lessons so\u00a0she can pay her rent and go to school. There's Kieko, a potter; Dave, who is really tall; Sara, who owns a bookstore; Claud, a writer whose real passion is\u00a0astronomy. Each of these people, twenty-one in all, are depicted in charming, colorful drawings that celebrate quirkiness and individuality.\u00a0This book encourages young readers to get to know the people around them and discover how everyone is different in their own\u00a0wonderful way.\u00a0</p>",
