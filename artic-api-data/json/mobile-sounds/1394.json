    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: These animated and exotically garbed young men clearly captured the imagination of a Tang Dynasty ceramics artist. The youth in cream colored pantaloons may once have held the reins of a spirited horse. His more elaborately dressed companion in green seems to be dancing.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  \u00a0The figure\u2019s curly hair is another clue that these figures are not Chinese but where were they from? Here\u2019s associate curator of Chinese art, Elinor Pearlstein.</p>\n<p>ELINOR PEARLSTEIN:\u00a0 I think it\u2019s impossible to pin down exact nationalities because the artist was probably unaware of their origin. What is<br>clear, though, is that they exaggerated these exotic features with a really keen observation and style.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The artist was probably familiar with a wide variety of foreign types. Certainly the artisans working in the Tang capital city of Chang\u2019an were. The streets and compounds of this busy metropolis were alive with all of the travelers of the silk road, the merchants, pilgrims, performers and adventurers who traversed deserts and mountains to seek their fortune. The sculptures you see in this case were all made to be buried with someone. In the prevailing Chinese tradition, the afterlife in some ways resembled this world. And this world for the residents of Chang\u2019an was a very cosmopolitan place.
