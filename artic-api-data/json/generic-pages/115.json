Ryan Learning Center has been organized in many ways over the years in response to evolving museum priorities, community dynamics, and the professionalization of the museum education field.   Underpinning the evolution of the museum\u2019s educational work is a vital and consistent vision: to be a museum that actively opens access and spurs meaningful engagement with works of art by a wide range of people, while simultaneously, enacting our identity as a museum of Chicago, carrying out our work much beyond our walls by partnering with organizations, public agencies, and communities across the broad Chicago region. Hallmarks of the Art Institute\u2019s educational work include community engagement initiatives and partnerships, K\u201312 school programs, groundbreaking interpretive spaces, family programs and resources, and programs that foster youth leadership and creative development within the context of an encyclopedic museum. Learn more about the department\u2019s history from 1897\u20132003 in this issue of Museum Studies (2003). ",
