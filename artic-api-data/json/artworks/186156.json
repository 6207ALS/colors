Skinner was a psychologist who taught at Harvard\u2014at the heart of his book is a belief that scientific study and socially engineered rewards and punishments can change human behavior.\n\nBehaviorism, as this idea was termed, was doomed from the start at Twin Oaks. Only three of the original eight founders were truly dedicated to creating a behaviorist community. More importantly, the commune was founded at the height of the hippie era\u2014a moment in time far more given over to personal liberty and spontaneity than to behavioral control or the dominance of reason over emotion.\n\nMoreover, the benefactor who made his land available to the commune stipulated that Twin Oaks must have a continuously increasing population to be in compliance with the lease. This provision forced the commune to accept new members regardless of their interest in the founding principles.\n\nAfter abandoning elemental behaviorism, except for the \u201cplanner-manager\u201d decision-making model (a system of elected managers whose decisions may be overturned by a majority of the membership) and the labor-credit work system, Twin Oaks thrived and continues to do so today. Ninety adults and fifteen children (there is a quota for the number of children) live happily and well on the land, and their commitment to functioning as a model social system based on equality, income sharing and nonviolence remains unswerving.\n\nMembers work actively for peace, justice, ecology and fairness. Anthropologist Jon Wagner considers Twin Oaks to be \u201camong the most non-sexist social systems in human history.\u201d Each summer, the community hosts a women\u2019s gathering, as well as the communities conference that has helped many other communes to successfully form and develop. Twin Oaks grows forty to sixty percent of its own food and is in the process of becoming an ecovillage. At present their collective income is derived from making and selling hammocks\u2014Pier One Imports is the largest purchaser of them. They also manufacture and sell tofu and offer services in book indexing and web design.\n\nBuildings at Twin Oaks are named after the great communes of the past, including Oneida, Harmony, Llano and Kaweah. With its long-term success and unwavering commitment to principles, Twin Oaks has proved itself the equal\u2014 and more\u2014of its antecedents.\n\nFrom the portfolio, Sweet Earth: Experimental Utopias in America, 1982\u20132005",
