    "description": "<p>The <em>I Am the Black Woman</em> series (previously called <em>Negro Women</em>) is composed of 15 linocuts accompanied by explanatory titles and texts. The series celebrates the courage and determination of female heroines of African American history, as well as the valor, integrity, and resolve of ordinary women. The Art Institute\u2019s three prints from the series focus on the daily struggles of African American women. Aesthetically, the entire series is characterized by an emphasis on figural simplicity. A palpable sense of movement and a lack of excessive detail are visible throughout the series. This print, <em>And a Special Fear for My Loved Ones</em>, draws attention to the issue of lynching, an ever-present threat that plagued the African American community in the South.</p>\n",
