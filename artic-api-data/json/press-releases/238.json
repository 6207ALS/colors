    "copy": " Monday, November 27, 2017   The Art Institute of Chicago , the High Museum of Art (High) , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) , The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston (MFAH) , The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art (NAMA) , and new partner institution the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA) , are pleased to announce an additional five-year grant to continue The Andrew W. Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship Program . The fellowship provides specialized training in the curatorial field to students across the United States who exemplify historically underrepresented groups in the curatorial field and support the goal of promoting pluralistic museums. More information about the need for a diverse educational pipeline into the curatorial field is available in The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Art Museum Staff Demographic Survey. The $3.25 million grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation is a continuation of the initial grant awarded in 2013.   The Andrew W. Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship Program aims to make a critical impact on American art museums by developing gifted curators who are committed to engaging with the full spectrum of museum audiences. Fellows participate in the program throughout their undergraduate career, with the goal of continuing their education through graduate work. Of the 20 fellows who have completed the program, 13 are either enrolled in graduate art history programs or working in the arts.   In the continuation of the program, 36 students nationwide will be selected for two-year fellowships following Summer Academies at each museum over the course of the next five years. The Summer Academy is a one-week intensive program consisting of workshops, tours, field trips, and networking events with museum professionals. Mellon Summer Academies will be offered in summer 2018, 2019, and 2020 at each partner museum. This program is open to freshman and sophomore students enrolled in undergraduate programs located near the partner museums. Fellowships provide students with hands-on experience inside a museum setting, assisting curators and staff on exhibitions, collections, and programs. Fellows are matched with a curatorial mentor at each museum who works to enrich the academic experience and to increase exposure to the museum context while broadening their understanding of art and art history. Fellowships include regular engagement during the academic school year followed by full-time engagement over the summer.   \u201cSeeking out fresh perspectives and new voices is essential to creating a bright future for museums that feel innovative, relevant, and dynamic,\u201d said James Rondeau, President and Eloise W. Martin Director of the Art Institute of Chicago . \u201cWe\u2019re grateful that The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation is renewing its crucial support to help us continue to invest in the next generation of curatorial leaders. We\u2019re continually impressed and inspired by the profound impact that our new and current fellows have in shaping our museum and who we aspire to be.\u201d   \u201cWe are extremely grateful to The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for their steadfast support of this program,\u201d said Rand Suffolk, Nancy and Holcombe T. Green, Jr., Director of the High Museum of Art . \u201cThe fellowship plays an increasingly vital role in encouraging and developing a talented and diverse field. We\u2019re honored to work with these students and are proud of their success.\u201d   \u201cThe Andrew W. Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship Program has completed a successful pilot phase, and we are already encouraged by the fellows who have inspired new ways of thinking about the permanent collection and have increased collaboration across curatorial departments,\u201d said Michael Govan, LACMA CEO and Wallis Annenberg Director .   \u201cOur museum is grateful for the Mellon Foundation's extraordinary generosity in supporting the training of students from diverse backgrounds. We believe that these young people are the future leaders of the curatorial field, and museums, in this country. Since the program began, the fellows at our museum have brought creativity, intelligence, and lively perspectives to our work. We await, with great anticipation, their contributions to the field,\u201d said Gary Tinterow, director, Museum of Fine Arts, Houston .   \u201cWe are honored to participate in the cultivation of future leaders to lend exciting and diverse viewpoints in our field through The Andrew W. Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship,\u201d said Juli\u00e1n Zugazagoitia, Menefee D. and Mary Louise Blackwell CEO & Director of the Nelson-Atkins . \u201cThis is an exciting way for art institutions to represent the communities they serve while giving students valuable experience and a deeper understanding of the way museums operate.\u201d   Timothy Rub, The George D. Widener Director and CEO, Philadelphia Museum of Art , stated, \u201cThe Philadelphia Museum of Art is delighted to join our partner institutions as a new museum participant in The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation\u2019s Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship Program. This initiative is enormously important. It will provide opportunities for students to gain valuable insights into curatorial work as well as practical learning experiences at the outset of their academic careers. It will also help to diversify a field that needs to address this issue in a thoughtful and forward-looking way. Access and engagement are the keys to encouraging the development of a new generation of professionals who can effectively serve the field in the future.\u201d   MEDIA CONTACTS:   Art Institute of Chicago Amanda Hicks | Executive Director of Communications | 312 443-7297 | ahicks@artic.edu   High Museum of Art Marci Davis | Manager of Public Relations | 404 733-4585 | marci.davis@high.org   Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) Miranda Carroll | Senior Communications Director | 323 857-6543 | mcarroll@lacma.org   Erin Yokomizo | Communications Associate | 323 932-5825 | eyokomizo@lacma.org   The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) Mary Haus | Marketing and Communications Director | 713 639-7712 | mhaus@mfah.org   The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art Kathleen Leighton | Manager, Media Relations and Video Production | 816 751-1321 | kleighton@nelson-atkins.org   Philadelphia Museum of Art Norman Keyes | Director of Communications | nkeyes@philamuseum.org   Joy Deibert | Senior Press Officer | joy.deibert@philamuseum.org     NOTES TO EDITORS:   About the Art Institute of Chicago   The Art Institute of Chicago is a world-renowned art museum housing one of the largest permanent collections in the United States.
