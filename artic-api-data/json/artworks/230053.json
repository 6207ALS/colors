    "description": "<p>Julia Margaret Cameron\u2019s son Henry Herschel Hay Cameron was a photographer in his own right, and in 1893 he issued this album in an effort to revive his mother\u2019s reputation as well as promote his own work. Consisting of 26 photogravures made from original negatives of both artists, Lord Tennyson and His Friends was published in an edition of 400 copies. An essay by the writer Anne Thackeray Ritchie, a family friend, accompanied the images; in it, she compared Julia Margaret Cameron to Old Master painters. This copy is open to an 1865 portrait by Cameron of Tennyson. A fully digitized version of the volume can be seen on the touch screens nearby.</p>\n",
