Whistler, printed, lower left  \nOne state; image size: 204 \u00d7 143 mm  \nPrinter: unknown  \nStone: presumably erased\n\nThe Standard Bearer, Whistler\u2019s only lithograph executed in pen and lithographic tusche on stone, exists in a unique impression donated to the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., by Francis Blackwell Mayer\u2019s stepdaughter, Mrs. John Sylvester. It was probably given its present title by A. Hyatt Mayor in 1937. More confident than Whistler\u2019s crayon lithograph of the same period (cat. 1), it depicts a swashbuckling romantic figure similar to those found in pen-and-ink drawings in the Winans Scrapbook, an album of early Whistleriana now in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (see fig. 2a [M 167]). Similar handling is found in the small heads Whistler sketched on his well-known Coast Survey Plate (K 1), as well as in the first etchings he made in Europe (probably in 1857), Au Sixi\u00e8me (K 3) and The Dutchman Holding a Glass (K 4).\n\nWashington: LC, ivory wove paper (306 \u00d7 239 mm), inscribed verso, in F.
