In Rome, he would have been introduced to Fuseli (who lived there 1770\u201378) and the radical style he and his circle were developing.<br>This sketch\u2019s rapidly applied ink and wash, characterized by long, fluid strokes of the brush, functioned as a rehearsal for the actual physical marks Romney would employ in his paintings. <em>Figure of a Woman</em> was probably a study for <em>Elizabeth Warren as Hebe</em> (1776), the artist\u2019s first major portrait after returning from Italy.</p>\n",
