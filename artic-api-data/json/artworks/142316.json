    "description": "<p>Richard Neutra was responsible for designing many of Los Angeles\u2019s most recognizable modern houses, yet he also built a large number of residences outside of Southern California. These commissions accelerated in the 1950s and 1960s, after Neutra appeared on the cover of Time in 1949, accompanied by the anxious caption, \u201cWhat will the neighbors think?\u201d Despite the growing popularity of California culture and lifestyle, Neutra\u2019s starkly modern houses still stood well outside of the American mainstream. Although the Bizzarri House in Cincinnati, Ohio, lacks the dramatic siting of many of his best houses, Neutra adroitly adapted his signature cantilevered roof and oversize redwood beams to house a screened porch\u2014an important environmental feature.</p>\n",
