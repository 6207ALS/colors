The same year, Matisse began making paintings such as Lemons on a Pewter Plate and Pineapples in a Basket (1926; fig. 39.1) that took inspiration from C\u00e9zanne\u2019s use of constructive brushstrokes as he built up thick impastos of saturated, contrasting colors to evoke a flood of direct light. Both paintings typify Matisse\u2019s mid-1920s shift away from the more naturalistic style seen in Still Life with Apples on a Pink Tablecloth (1924; fig. 39.2) and toward the abstracted experimentations with depth, volume, and flatness presented in his monumental canvas Decorative Figure on an Ornamental Background (winter 1925\u201326; fig. 39.3). In Lemons on a Pewter Plate, the artist gradually built the textured composition with a palette knife until he achieved a pictorial balance between color, light, material, surface, and depth.\n\nThe thickly layered, frosting-like texture of Lemons on a Pewter Plate reflects the lasting impact of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s brightly colored, densely constructed compositions, which also appears in works from the previous decade, including Apples (1916; cat. 24). In 1925, just a year before finishing Lemons on a Pewter Plate, Matisse described the older artist\u2019s significance to his early practice in an interview with the writer and critic Jacques Guenne. He reminisced, \u201cIn moments of doubt . . . I thought: \u2018If C\u00e9zanne is right, I am right\u2019 . . . There are, you see, constructional laws in the work of C\u00e9zanne which are useful to a young painter. He had, among his great virtues, the merit of wanting the tones to be forces in a painting.\u201d By 1926, Matisse owned several of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s works, including Three Bathers (1879\u201382) and Fruits and Foliage (c. 1890; fig. 39.4), which he purchased in 1899 and 1911, respectively. Both paintings exemplify his use of richly worked material surfaces and vivid colors to balance the effects of volume and surface in his compressed compositions. Matisse looked to such works as he built up the forms in Lemons on a Pewter Plate by spreading thick layers of paint on the canvas with a palette knife. The artist rendered elements such as the pattern of the decorative textile by using the knife to scrape layers of increasingly bright, contrasting tones of material into the heavy red-orange and white arabesques that give visual structure to the canvas.\n\nWhile Lemons on a Pewter Plate reflects Matisse\u2019s engagement with C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work, it also demonstrates his interest in the intense Mediterranean sunlight that transformed his painting during the Nice period. In 1926 Matisse moved from the third floor to the top floor apartment at 1, place Charles-F\u00e9lix, which had floor-to-ceiling windows facing the Baie des Anges. In this large, sun-filled workspace, the artist fully experienced the effects of light on color and form that he would later depict in luminous, washed-out tones in works such as Nude in the Studio (1928; fig. 39.5). By making Lemons on a Pewter Plate in layers, he experimented with different color combinations before settling on highly saturated, contrasting tones to evoke light and sharpen elements such as the lemons and the pink tabletop, its light wooden edge highlighted by the shadow below. In the central platter, Matisse depicted the brilliance of the sunlight through the dark, rich reflection of the lemons, which he further accentuated by scraping rounded grooves into the white-trimmed rim of the platter and around the edges of the leaves.\n\nAt this time of artistic transition, Matisse revisited the familiar genre of the still life, which had often inspired stylistic experimentation since his first pair of paintings, Still Life with Books (June 1890; location unknown), and his early copies of still lifes by Jean-Sim\u00e9on Chardin that Matisse made as a student. Although he frequently used other media\u2014small prints, monotypes, or quick pencil sketches\u2014to renew his approach to painting, the still life also offered a means to \u201ckeep one\u2019s eye, one\u2019s feeling, fresh.\u201d In January 1926, his son Pierre called attention to the importance of the artist\u2019s early success in the genre upon seeing his monumental 1915 canvas Still Life after Jan Davidsz. de Heem\u2019s \u201cLa Desserte\u201d (fig. 39.6)\u2014itself a recapitulation of an 1893 copy of La Desserte that Matisse had painted. When the work went on view in New York for an exhibition in memory of the recently deceased American collector John Quinn, Pierre wrote: \u201cYour still life lights up the whole room . . . It\u2019s splendid, the colors have remained as fresh as when you first painted the canvas. It gave me quite a jolt to see it again.\u201d Soon after, Matisse again experimented with the still life in Lemons on a Pewter Plate, playing with the material and using saturated colors to accentuate the effects of light and space. The artist progressed from more muted tones to vivid hues that contrast sharply, bringing the spatial tension in the composition into focus. In the sliver of background on the left, for example, slight traces of the artist\u2019s earlier use of both dark and light blue on the upper section and bright red in the lower area remain visible beneath the top layer of dark blue and brown, which he applied late in the process over the dried paint. Matisse settled on darker colors for the background and the knob on the front panel of the table to exaggerate the depth of space and further emphasize the brilliant illumination and flattening effect of the decorative cloth and platter of lemons without altering the composition. This canvas remained important for Matisse, who hung the work in his home and ultimately declined a commission to make a reproduction (fig. 39.7).  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Lemons on a Pewter Plate was painted on a pre-primed, no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size (65 \u00d7 54 cm) linen canvas. There appear to be sketch lines in black paint for the composition, such as the edge of the fabric and plate. Although the paint layers were initially applied by brush and a few scattered remnants of the early brushstrokes are still visible, the overriding surface texture is of thick impasto created by the palette knife, which Matisse used to spread the paint into desired shapes and textures and to mix adjacent colors into one another. There is no evidence that the artist made a preliminary outline for the pattern of the fabric behind the table. The freeform execution of the orange-and-white design suggests that it was to some degree determined by the artist\u2019s manipulation of the palette knife. The multidirectional sculpting of the thick paint with the knife was necessarily somewhat awkward, resulting in many fractured edges and errant paint residues in the animated design.\n\nThe most intensely colored areas in the finished picture, the orange of the fabric design and the related orange-pink of the tabletop, were initially painted in more neutral tones, which are still intermittently visible and add depth to the surface. The foliate backdrop went through various color permutations of gray and brown, with the final orange added late in the painting process. Matisse began the tabletop with brown, gray, and black, which he applied by brush and worked with the knife. Over this, he added an intense, dark orange-pink and spots of white and then used the knife to blend and marbleize the many resulting tints, wet-in-wet, directly on the canvas, leaving veins of the brown/gray underlayer visible. The lemons and leaves required a more careful placement on the plate, and there is some evidence of sketch lines. Matisse scraped off an earlier version of the lemons with the knife while still wet, and he might later have also changed the position of the far left lemon. At a late stage, Matisse repeatedly changed the colors and intensity of the dark vertical wedge along the left edge of the painting, before finally adding the present blue-gray on the top section and muted olive below. Some earlier gradations and changes can still be seen on the surface.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 39.8).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right corner, in black paint) (fig. 39.9 and fig. 39.10). The underlying paint was dry when signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond to a no. 15 portrait (figure) standard-size stretcher (65 \u00d7 54 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.7V (0.9) \u00d7 21.9H (0.6) threads/cm. The horizontal threads are presumed to be the warp and the vertical ones to the weft.\n\nNubby threads, and a particularly tight weave. Matisse may have chosen a tight weave canvas knowing that he would applying pressure with a palette knife, which can stretch and distort a looser weave (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions).\n\nThe selvage edge is not present, and all edges are cut through the pre-primed ground. The weave maps give no indication of the location of this painting in relation to the larger canvas width, as there is no sign of primary cusping near any of the edges. Therefore, this canvas was probably cut from somewhere in the middle of the larger primed canvas. Mild cusping at small intervals is present on all four sides. Tacking margins on the right, left, and top measure 2\u20132.5 cm; and on the bottom, 1.5\u20132 cm. The tacking margins are narrow but original, since variations in the edges follow placement of the original tack holes.\n\nCurrent stretching: After lining, the canvas was stretched onto a new stretcher slightly larger than the original stretcher, so the unpainted tacking margins are now partially folded onto the front (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: The original stretcher was off-square with the right side slightly longer. The top edge sloped upward toward the right, with a rise of 0.5 cm from left to right.\n\nCurrent stretcher: At some point before the painting entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection, a wood expansion bolt five-member stretcher was added.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded/not documented.\n\nNone observed in the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nCross-sectional analysis shows a light tan-colored sizing layer below the ground (probably glue). This layer has a blue fluorescence in ultraviolet light (fig. 39.11).\n\nPre-primed. Cross-sectional analysis revealed a single layer that ranges in thickness from 38 to 86 \u03bcm.\n\nWhite. (fig. 39.12). There are traces of yellow, orange, red, and dark blackish particles in the mixture (fig. 39.13).\n\nFTIR analysis determined the ground is composed of lead white (basic lead carbonate) in an oil medium with some lead soaps. SEM/EDX analysis disclosed a mixture of mostly lead white with traces of various iron oxides and associated silicates.\n\nBlack painted sketch lines are visible under the microscope at major divisions of the composition such as the outline of the plate, the left edge of the fabric, and the wedge-shaped background (fig. 39.14 and fig. 39.15). There is also some evidence of sketch lines for the lemons. Reflected- and transmitted-infrared imaging do not reveal any underlying sketch, even in more thinly painted areas.\n\nThe design of the orange and white backdrop does not seem to have been determined by linear contours, but rather, created by Matisse pushing the paint around with the palette knife. It is quite possible that no preliminary sketch on the ground existed.\n\nBlack oil paint (estimated).\n\nThe few revisions appear to have been made during the painting process (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions).\n\nMatisse used the palette knife over almost the entire surface. Remnants of brush marks are found on the paint surface in scattered areas, suggesting that Matisse initially applied the paint by brush and then manipulated it with the knife. He occasionally made minor adjustments with a flick of the brush. He also used the brush in areas too narrow for knife modeling, such as the front edges of the tabletop and pewter plate, then lightly squashing some of the brush\u2019s texture with the knife (fig. 39.16 and fig. 39.17).\n\nMany of the colors Matisse used to block in the forms were changed in subsequent layers. The pattern of the fabric was first brushed in with pale shades of blue-green and pinkish tan (fig. 39.18). He next used the knife to lay in the pattern with a darker tan, and the surrounding spaces were then painted with different shades of gray (fig. 39.19). Matisse added white over the gray and then a light orange over the tan pattern, and finally, after other areas of the composition had been painted, he added scarlet orange over the lighter orange shade. Thus, the appearance of the backdrop progressed from neutral tan and gray to more intense and higher contrasting orange and white.\n\nMatisse\u2019s work on the tabletop followed a similar path. The initial layers of paint, in mixtures of brown, white, and black, were at least partially applied by brush. He smoothed a deep, intense orange-pink on top of the browns with the palette knife, and then he blended lighter shades of pink and white over the surface. The knife effectively mixed the colors, wet-in-wet, leaving a few gaps down to the browns underneath (fig. 39.20). He used brushwork again in the top layers to apply highlights and make indentations in the smooth knife work (fig. 39.21). Beneath the tabletop, the table base was painted with varied hues of a richer red-brown and olive-green shading (still visible at the knob), and black delineating the edges. Later the more neutral brown was applied to the surface (fig. 39.22 and fig. 39.23).\n\nMatisse made subtle use of varied grays in the pewter plate, interspersing the bluish gray with brighter yellowish grays and darker maroon grays (fig. 39.24). Reflections of the yellow lemons and a green leaf are painted on the inner rim reflected back in more somber tones of ocher and blue-green, while a maroon serves as a reflection for the darker orange of the backdrop (fig. 39.25). The gray of the pewter rim was wiped away before the lemons\u2019 reflections were painted, which produced a softer reflection. The lemons, in turn, seem to reflect the plate with the thin smears of gray on their skins that also anchor their lighter forms to the platter. Matisse had added the lemons and surrounding leaves but then scraped them away with the knife while the paint was still wet, leaving veils of abraded color, including spots of the gray underlayer in the canvas texture (fig. 39.26). After removing those forms, Matisse painted new lemons, first with yellow ocher, still visible at their edges, then yellow, followed with gray. The transmitted-infrared image reveals a rounded silhouette beneath the present top leaf, which appears to be the leftmost lemon in a higher position, in line with the two rear lemons, instead of close to the one in front (fig. 39.27). The lemon leaves show a few brush marks from the initial application of paint, and while some leaves were left unaltered, the area was reworked with the knife (fig. 39.28). Rounded grooves in the thick paint of the leaves may have been made with the wood end of a brush or the tip of the palette knife.\n\nFinally, Matisse reworked the dark wedge-shaped space that extends vertically along the left edge of the composition. The top half of this area was initially painted dark blue and the bottom, reddish brown. These were applied when the adjacent white of the backdrop fabric was still wet but before the final layer of scarlet orange was added (fig. 39.29 and fig. 39.30). Matisse next applied a paler blue to the upper portion and a bright vermilion on the lower; the paint thinned as he applied it, leaving visible a large section of the initial dark blue at the top and reddish brown at the bottom (fig. 39.31). Later, he painted a thin black layer over the vermilion. At this point he tried a one-inch horizontal strip of red over the bottom of the blue area. He then painted the final blue-gray over the top and dark olive over the bottom, but again left areas of the earlier colors exposed. These final layers were applied after the underlying paint was dry and may constitute a later reworking. Ultimately, Matisse settled for muted noncontrasting hues that are of a tone dark enough to visually recede alongside the adjacent orange-and-white backdrop.\n\nMatisse added texture with a palette knife throughout the entire canvas. The knife determined the actual contours of each shape and created the materiality of the surface, adding animation more random than possible with a brush. He used the palette knife to push the paint into the backdrop design, using the tip and edge of the implement like a fingertip to push the paint around the small curves (fig. 39.32). He also used it to smooth large areas on the plate to create the effect of a smooth metallic surface (fig. 39.33). Matisse used the palette knife to cut across the curve where the rim of the pewter plate curves around on the right and disappears. He applied layer upon layer of paint, sculpting it with his knife and creating a topography of smooth expanses, sharp ridges, jagged edges, gentle dips, and intermittent skips in the paint layer. Many different effects result from the use of a knife\u2014slight changes in its angle or pressure can create a lively variation in the paint thickness and texture. Pushing a large amount of paint creates firm edges and a raised ridge where the knife stops or where paint is squeezed out beyond its edge. If the paint under the knife is uneven or residual, this may result in fragmented, rougher edges, pits, and skips (fig. 39.34). As Matisse flattened and pushed the paint around, the outer edges were less controlled and more variable than a brush would produce (fig. 39.35). Thus, Lemons on a Pewter Plate exhibits not only surface variations but also edge variations that animate the shapes, for example, the meandering edge of the table and the undulating rim of the pewter plate that, though painted with a brush, are both shaped by the adjacent knifed edges (fig. 39.36). Matisse also used wiping, in one instance to reduce the small area of an earlier painted leaf (fig. 39.37). In a few spots the imprinted texture of a fabric is visible, perhaps from the end of a wiping cloth or from the artist\u2019s sleeve (fig. 39.38). Sometimes the artist also used the tip of the palette knife or the wooden end of his brush to create grooves in the paint (fig. 39.39).\n\nPalette knife, brush, brush end, cloth for wiping.\n\nAll the primary and secondary colors are represented except purple, although black over vermilion on the left wedge approximates purple, and there are a few plum shadows and a maroon reflection on the pewter plate.\n\nThe intense orange in the backdrop, together with the orange and white mixture on the tabletop, predominates, complemented by the deep shade of blue in the upper left corner. In the initial paint layers, however, Matisse used more neutral shades of browns and grays.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nIn the dark orange of the textile, Matisse made the paint more fluid, perhaps with extra medium, so it would be easier to move around. This greater fluidity created fluttery edges, and allowed the paint to be easily attenuated into a thin film that revealed the pale-orange layer beneath. Adding white into his paint mixtures made for a stiffer blend and a more evenly knifed surface, as seen in the tabletop and pewter plate.\n\nAt some point before the painting entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection in 1999, a synthetic varnish was applied to the surface. It was removed in 2008, and the surface was not revarnished (see Conservation History). However, there appears to be the artist\u2019s original coating overall. The slight bluish fluorescence overall attests to this (fig. 39.40). This coating does not appear discolored. The coating is insoluble, like the varnishes Matisse applied to other paintings.\n\nThe painting entered the Art Institute\u2019s collection in 1999, with a Beva 371 lining and a glossy, synthetic varnish. After lining, the canvas had been stretched onto a new stretcher slightly larger than the original one, leaving the unpainted tacking margins visible on the front of the painting. Some flake losses had been inpainted, as had some holes that were not losses, but rather skips from the knife technique.\n\nIn 2008, the synthetic varnish and retouching were removed, leaving the original artist\u2019s coating intact. Small actual losses were filled and retouched. The surface was not revarnished.\n\nThe painting is in very good condition. It has some cracks through the thick paint and a number of small losses, especially in the orange textile. The lining has stabilized the canvas, and the paint now seems secure. The removal of the synthetic varnish reestablished the original surface appearance. The gloss of the artist\u2019s original varnish does not have the distracting sparkle of a synthetic varnish, and the plasticity of the paint manipulation is now more immediate.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2009): The frame is not original to the painting. It is an Italian, eighteenth-century, Salvator Rosa, silver-gilt frame. The frame has silverleaf water gilding with a Mecca gold varnish on a raw sienna\u2013colored bole over gesso. The moldings and cassetta are all poplar. The face moldings are mitered and glued and nailed to the cassetta base with an ogee molding carved at the exterior. The frame has been altered in the past. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ogee; scotia; thumb-shape profile with a convex face; and fillet with a quirked ogee at the sight edge (fig. 39.41).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by late 1930s\u201350s; removed 2009): The painting was previously housed in a Louis XV, ogee frame with anthemia, floral, and a foliate cartouche at the miters and shell-and-floral foliate centers. The frame was heavily altered, and little of the original surface was retained. The frame has water gilding on a red-orange bole on gesso. Large sections of the frame were later reworked and overgilded and heavily distressed and toned with a thin decape wash. The carved oak moldings were mitered and joined with sliding angled dovetails. The moldings were resized for this work with cuts between the centers and corner cartouches butt jointed, and the adapted moldings were glued to a half-lapped back frame of American chestnut. The adaption was done at some point between the end of the 1930s and the 1950s, and it probably occurred in New York. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, was straight outside edge; ovolo with running ovate; scotia side; fillet<ins cite=\"mailto:AIC%20%20\" datetime=\"2017-07-12T13:52\">;</ins> thumb-shape rail; fillet; ogee with anthemia and floral and foliate cartouches and shells and floral foliate centers; fillet; sanded frieze; ovolo with running acanthus and bellflower at the sight edge; and an independent linen-covered fillet liner with a gilded fillet at the sight edge (fig. 39.42).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1930; removed at an unknown date): The painting was exhibited in an earlier frame at the Galerien Thannhauser exhibition, Henri Matisse (Feb. 15\u2013Mar. 19, 1930) in Berlin (fig. 39.43).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Collection of the artist until at least Sept. 15, 1931.\n\nPierre Matisse Gallery, New York, by Nov. 15, 1938\u2013Apr. 27, 1942.\n\nLee A.

(University of California Press, 1995), p. 80.\n\nWhen Matisse donated C\u00e9zanne\u2019s Three Bathers to the Mus\u00e9e du Petit Palais, Paris, in 1936, he wrote to the museum\u2019s director Raymond Escholier: \u201cThis picture is of the first importance in the work of C\u00e9zanne because it is a very dense, very complete realization of a composition that he carefully considered in several canvases . . . It has sustained me morally in the critical moments of my venture as an artist; I have drawn from it my faith and my perseverance . . . It is rich in color and surface, and seen at a distance it is possible to appreciate the sweep of its lines and the exceptional sobriety of its relationships.\u201d Matisse to Escholier, Nov. 10, 1936, as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 124.\n\nAs Matisse told Louis Aragon in 1943: \u201cIf I had painted in the north, as I did thirty years ago, my painting would have been different. There would have been browns, grays, shadings of color through perspective . . . Nice in this sense, has helped me.\u201d Aragon, \u201cMatisse-en-France,\u201d in Henri Matisse, Dessins: Th\u00e8mes et variations (M. Fabiani, 1943), as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, pp. 288\u201389, n. 4.\n\nDominique Fourcade has argued that in the works of Matisse\u2019s Nice period, \u201cEach parcel of the painting\u2019s surface is a site of color, whether it represents lemons or a woman\u2019s body or part of the room\u2019s wall; and each site of color becomes a source of light that, combined with all the other sources of light on the canvas, create a wholeness of light and space.\u201d See Fourcade, \u201cUninterrupted Story,\u201d p. 55. On the significance of Matisse\u2019s move to the bright, fourth-floor apartment with direct sunlight at 1, place Charles-F\u00e9lix, between the fall of 1926 and spring of 1927, see Jack Cowart, \u201cThe Place of Silvered Light: An Expanded, Illustrated Chronology of Matisse in the South of France, 1916\u20131932,\u201d in Cowart and Fourcade, Henri Matisse, pp. 28\u201332.\n\nOn this early work, see Elderfield, \u201cModernism and Tradition.\u201d\n\nHenri Matisse, interview with Ragnar Hoppe, June 1919, as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, p. 75.\n\nFor a thorough analysis of this work, see Elderfield, \u201cStill Life after Jan Davidsz. De Heem\u2019s \u2018La desserte,\u2019\u201d in D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, Matisse, pp. 254\u201359.\n\nSee Art Center, Memorial Exhibition of Representative Works Selected from the John Quinn Collection, January 7th to 30th, 1926 (Art Center, 1926). In a letter from Pierre Matisse to Henri Matisse, Pierre continued to praise his father\u2019s work, writing, \u201cThe Seurat looks pale beside it . . . and the Gauguin flat, while the Picasso and the Derain look like gouaches that have been squared up and enlarged.\u201d P. Matisse to H. Matisse, Jan. 9, 1926, as translated in Hilary Spurling, Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse; The Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954 (Knopf, 2005), p. 277.\n\nBased on the differences between a photograph of the painting taken in June 1929 and a photograph of the work on view in a February\u2013March 1930 exhibition at Galerien Thannhauser in Berlin, Richard R. Brettell has argued that Matisse may have made this final change to the background in 1929 before sending the canvas to Berlin. See the entry on this work in Brettell and Natalie Henderson Lee, Monet to Moore: The Millennium Gift of Sara Lee Corporation (Yale University Press, 1999), p. 109.\n\nBased on information from Wanda de Gu\u00e9briant at the Matisse Foundation, Brettell has argued that the lower work in the photograph is an ultimately rejected, texturized, full-scale reproduction of Lemons on a Pewter Plate. See Brettell and Lee, Monet to Moore, pp. 108\u201309.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification.

The tan under the design contributes the darkest spots. In the X-ray the fabric seems very full because both the white and orange are very dense and appear as white shapes. Particularly in the X-ray, gradations produced by thinning the paint with the palette knife seem to model these forms, lending them an oddly bulbous look. At the same time the orange and white pigments are of similar density and thickness, so appear undifferentiated. The darker areas in the X-ray are more thinly painted and the darkest areas reflect the exposed ground and lower layers. When looking at the painting itself, on the other hand, differences in color are perceived more immediately than differences in thickness.\n\nThese colors would have echoed, at a lower register, the tan and blue-green of the earlier fabric design. It is difficult to determine whether the related colors of these two areas would have been visible at the same time.\n\nAlternatively, this rounded form could be an earlier light green leaf, since this green and the yellow have a similarly bright reflectance under infrared light.\n\nSome pinks were added to the brown.\n\nThe blade of the palette knife is flexible so pressure can be varied and exerted at different parts of the knife with a slight shift of the wrist. Paint can be scraped with the edge, scratched or grooved with the rounded point of the tip, and spread smoothly with the flat face.\n\nIt is interesting to consider a possible intermediate stage: if the browns and grays of the initial layers were all present at the same time, the pure yellow and greens of the lemons would have glowed within their thick, pasty, neutral brown and gray environment.\n\nA scraping of this coating has been taken but has not yet been analyzed. The one on Woman before an Aquarium (1921\u201323; cat. 34) was analyzed by FTIR and found to be a mixture of oil and natural resin.\n\nThe other paintings by Matisse in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection that appear to have artist-applied overall varnishes: Apples (1916; cat. 24), Woman on a Rose Divan (1921; cat. 33), Woman before an Aquarium (1921\u201323; cat. 34), and Girl in Yellow and Blue with a Guitar (1939; cat. 46), and ones with artist-applied partial varnishes are Laurette with Cup of Coffee (1916\u201317; cat. 26) and Daisies (1939; cat. 47). Manipulation of paint with a palette knife often results in an uneven gloss with enriched and matte areas.\n\nSee Faye Wrubel, treatment report, Sept. 17, 2008, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe reframing was part of a campaign corresponding with the opening of the Renzo Piano\u2013designed Modern Wing addition to the Art Institute in 2009.\n\nThe low quality of the image of the frame makes it difficult to offer an accurate description.\n\nHenri Matisse, exh. cat., with texts by Henri Matisse and Carl Egger (Kunsthalle Basel, 1931), p. 16, cat. 78.\n\nPierre Matisse Gallery, Henri Matisse: Paintings, Drawings of 1918 to 1938, exh. cat.
