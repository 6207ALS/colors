    "transcript": "<p>Narrator: Curator, Rebecca Long.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: So we\u2019re looking at a &lt;music begins&gt; 13th Century carved ivory Madonna and Child.</p>\n<p>Narrator: Curator, Martha Wolff.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: She\u2019s very solid.  She\u2019s really grounded and seated on her throne that\u2019s at the same time really tender.  The expression of the Christ Child in particular is delightful, humorous, lively.  He\u2019s holding a little bird.<br>&lt;laughter&gt;</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: I didn\u2019t look it up.<br>&lt;laughter&gt;</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: It\u2019s probably a goldfinch or something.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: It\u2019s probably a goldfinch, yeah.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: Yeah.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: This, it\u2019s a symbol, a traditional symbol of the Passion of Christ.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: That has, is partly broken, and she\u2019s just gazing benignly really at him, but tenderly as well.</p>\n<p>Rebecca Long: To me, what\u2019s fascinating about this object is that story of the international trade in ivory that was allowing these to become so popular as luxury goods.</p>\n<p>Martha Wolff: This ivory, which comes from Northern France in the first half of the 13th Century, is the beginning of a great influx of ivory into Northern Europe and the establishment of a real center for the carving of ivory and real advances in the way the tusk was used and the forms were developed within the confines of that curving shape.</p>\n",
