Describing the town to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel, he called it \u201cone of the most beautiful places\u201d that they had visited, and he expressed his intention to return alone, in order \u201cto bring back a series of new things.\u201d A month later, Monet arrived in Bordighera, and from his base at the Pension Anglaise began to work intensely for what he initially estimated would be a period of three weeks but instead lasted for nearly three months. He would not return to France until mid-April 1884, but sent ahead the fruit of his labors: forty-five paintings, representing what the art historian Paul Tucker has estimated to be a painting every two days, and featuring a variety of views along the coast from Ventimigilia, Italy, to Monte Carlo and Menton, across the border in France.\n\nThree of these depict Bordighera\u2019s old, upper quarter, the citt\u00e1 alta, on the Cape of Sant\u2019Ampelio (fig. 20.1), seen from the same angle but at different elevations, looking down at the seaside village below. Compositionally, the Art Institute\u2019s version is the most radical of the three; the interlaced trunks of the pines create a decorative screen that nearly obfuscates the picturesque subject of the sun-soaked village against the blue sea that is also the focus of the other two versions. Perhaps for this reason, this canvas was the only one of the three that Durand-Ruel did not buy following the artist\u2019s return from the south. Four years later, Monet showed the three Bordighera canvases in his one-man exhibition, along with other works from his trip to the Franco-Italian coast, at the Sixth International Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture held at Galerie Georges Petit, Paris, in May\u2013June 1887. The Chicago painting remained unsold until 1891, despite the praise it received from Monet\u2019s future biographer, the art critic Gustave Geffroy, who called it an \u201cextraordinary canvas, crammed with an eruption of unimaginable vegetation ablaze with light that bursts forth like the sudden appearance of the sun, making everything around it fade.\u201d\n\nCharles Stuckey credits the artist\u2019s choice of a high vantage point and the arboreal framing device to the visit Monet made with Renoir to Paul C\u00e9zanne\u2019s home at l\u2019Estaque a few months prior; there he would have seen C\u00e9zanne\u2019s views of this seaside village, made in series-like fashion, with a similar focus (fig. 20.2). But it is also clear from Monet\u2019s letters home to his companion, Alice Hosched\u00e9\u2014complaining about the overly abundant foliage, which thrilled him even as it thwarted his attempts to isolate the appropriate motif\u2014that his decision to position himself above the Mediterranean palms, pines, and olive trees was a necessary strategy.\n\nMonet\u2019s visit to the Italian Riviera in 1883 was a vacation from work, but he returned in January 1884 with missionary zeal, primed for battle and hoping to bring back paintings that would capture the region he felt required a \u201cpalette of diamonds and jewels because of the blues and pinks.\u201d The Art Institute\u2019s painting and two related canvases were among those he began after February 7, when he gained access to the private residence of Francesco Moreno on the Via Romana, a short walk from the Pension Anglaise near the citt\u00e0 alta (fig. 20.3). The numerous pictures Monet painted there showcase Moreno\u2019s property, especially the \u201cpure fairyland garden\u201d located along the Via Romana (fig. 20.4, fig. 20.5 [D277], and fig. 20.6 [W865]), including one promised to the artist Berthe Morisot as a decoration for the dining room of her recently finished home in Paris (fig. 20.7 [W857]). But for the Chicago painting and two related views Monet chose a vantage point outside the Moreno gardens, up the Via Romana to the area around the Torre dei Mostaccini (fig. 20.8), an ancient Roman watchtower surrounded by a stone wall.\n\nThe tower, overlooking Bordighera and its citt\u00e0 alta, was a popular attraction, as evidenced by contemporary guidebook descriptions. It is even possible that Monet was aware of a contemporary guidebook to artistic views in Bordighera, Les motifs artistiques de Bordighera, by fellow Frenchman and architect of the Paris Op\u00e9ra Charles Garnier, which included a description of the picturesque possibilities looking down from the tower:\n\nWe must now pass by the stone wall raised in front of the tower, and turn again into the little bridle-path which descends on our right, and by which we shall arrive almost immediately at the level plateau, where there is the cluster of pines which crowns that portion of the summit [emphasis added]. Before continuing the track which leads us back again to the plain, let us stop for a few moments on the pine crest and turn our eyes toward the left: here are at least four or five delightful subjects for our sketch-books, which seem to stand out from their surroundings, as if only waiting to be reproduced on canvas. This is an especially characteristic corner of Bordighera, and one which is not likely to be soon forgotten.\n\nThe picturesque view of Bordighera described here\u2014seen from the path leading up to the tower and reproduced in a contemporary postcard (fig. 20.9)\u2014was captured by Monet in three canvases. He seems to have set up his easel at three different elevations, each of which allowed the full vision of the skyline. Perhaps beginning at the plateau mentioned in the guidebook (fig. 20.10 [W852]), he gradually moved up the hill (fig. 20.11 [W853]) to finally arrive at the summit (the Chicago version), from where Bordighera appears nested, less panoramic, and secondary to its lush surroundings. The Art Institute painting is the only one of the three in which the twisted trunks and branches of pine trees nearly screen out the village. At the same time, the artist was careful not to block the tower of one of the topographical landmarks, the bell tower of the old city (fig. 20.12), moving it to the left so that it would not be hidden by the largest, centermost tree (fig. 20.13). Indeed, Monet seems to have privileged the trees, leaving them intact and painting over the bell tower (to accommodate its shifted position) after it was dry (fig. 20.14), as he did with some of the buildings and foliage at the right edge of the village, which once extended up a little bit more into what is now the water.\n\nThe most radical and distinguishing aspects of the painting are the patterns of pine trees, which curtain the seascape. X-ray images show that these were drawn in paint at the initial stage of the lay-in, while the rest of the composition, especially the town with the bell tower that he shifted to the left, seems to have been first laid in and then altered (fig. 20.15). Monet highlighted the trunks with long, impasted strokes of white paint to suggest the streaming sunlight on the hillside in contrast to the flecked, comma-like strokes that he used to describe the surrounding foliage (e.g., fig. 20.16).\n\nAs usual, the technical strategies Monet adopted in earlier landscapes and seascapes were now applied: capturing the main features of the motif with thinly applied brushstrokes, building the composition up from this initial lay-in, and employing wet-on-wet touches of color to add texture and highlights (see Technical Report). In the Chicago version especially, he painted wet-on-wet in the foliage but in other areas let the paint dry completely before returning to make changes or rework the original idea, such as in the tree trunk at right (fig. 20.17; see Technical Report). Added to his previous commitment to painting en plein air was the need to calculate and create chromatic harmonies. This required a large space, one that allowed him to spread out his canvases and assess his work to date. In a letter to Durand-Ruel in late April, Monet insisted that he be able to rework the paintings from his Italian trip before handing anything over to the gallery\u2014a demand that underscored the importance the artist placed on the effect of the totality, of the ensemble, which could not be realized fully in front of the motif.\n\nThe village and landscape of Bordighera presented the artist with particular new challenges, including its rich vegetation, so different from the coast of Normandy. And its foreignness, which, coupled with his self-imposed isolation, pushed him out of the familiar into radical experimentations of color and light.  \nGloria Groom\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Bordighera was painted on a pre-primed, no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size linen canvas. The off-white ground layer consists of a single, or possibly double, application. The painting was built up using a variety of brush applications, including thinly applied strokes used for the initial lay-in of the composition; this was followed by a buildup of smooth, opaque brushstrokes and low impasto, and some final, light-handed strokes that skip across the surface of the underlying paint texture. The brushstrokes were applied in a relatively open network that leaves small areas of the ground layer exposed throughout the painting. Only a few minor revisions were made to the composition during painting. These include a change in the position of the bell tower, which was originally painted farther to the right on the other side of the adjacent tree. The buildings and foliage at the right edge of the village seem to have originally extended up a little farther into the area now occupied by the water. A slight adjustment was also made to the contour of the diagonal tree trunk, just above the left side of the village.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 20.18).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 84 (lower left corner, in dark-reddish-brown paint) (fig. 20.19). There is some wet-in-wet mixing with underlying paint layers, specifically, the bright-yellow and bright-green strokes of the foliage (fig. 20.20). These strokes may represent final touches added just before the painting was signed.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond closely to a no. 25 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas (81 \u00d7 65 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 23.5V (1.5) \u00d7 19.3H (0.5) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nCusping is very pronounced and widely spaced along the right edge and strong along the bottom edge. There is mild, closely spaced cusping on the top edge. Cusping on the left edge is difficult to discern.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1966 treatment (see Conservation History); copper tacks spaced 7\u20139 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: The original tacking margins are deteriorated and abraded, with several losses to the fabric. The old tack holes, spaced 3\u20134 cm apart, probably represent two or more tacking campaigns. There are also some smaller, less deteriorated pinholes. The tack holes do not appear to correspond to the cusping pattern, but this is difficult to confirm since not all of the edges are intact. On the right edge, where cusping is most pronounced, the point of attachment seems to be well beyond the current edge of the fabric.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Four-membered ICA spring stretcher. Depth: 2.5 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded/not documented.\n\nNone observed in the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric that was probably commercially prepared. The ground layer is relatively thin, and the canvas weave remains prominent. Cross-sectional analysis of a sample taken from the tacking edge suggests the presence of a single layer (fig. 20.21); however, the backscattered electron (BSE) image of a cross section taken from the picture plane indicates a possible double application (fig. 20.22). There are numerous old, tiny losses of paint and ground layers throughout the painting, as well as microcracking in the ground that corresponds to the weave of the canvas (fig. 20.23).\n\nThe ground is off-white in color, with some dark particles observed under magnification.\n\nAnalysis indicates that the ground contains lead white with traces of iron oxides, alumina, silica, barium sulfate, silicates, and calcium-based white.\n\nNone detected with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe work was painted using an open network of brushstrokes with small patches of exposed ground visible throughout. The composition was laid in using thinly applied strokes of paint that emphasize the texture of the canvas weave, and was then built up using thicker, more textural strokes and low impasto (fig. 20.24). The tree trunks and main branches were mapped out early on in the composition, with the landscape, sea, and sky built up around them. The trunks and branches were laid in using thinly applied, dark reddish-brown and purplish-gray strokes (fig. 20.25); this early brushwork was mostly covered by the subsequent buildup of paint, which includes both smooth and highly textured strokes, layered one over the other along the length of the trees (fig. 20.26). The sky was built up using varying shades of pale blue and gray, while the starting point for the water was a deeper blue. The foliage was laid in using individual touches of thinly applied color in relatively dull tones compared with the more brightly colored brushstrokes used in the upper paint layers (fig. 20.27, fig. 20.28). The painting was then built up using a variety of superimposed brush applications. This includes solid, relatively smooth strokes; thicker, more textural strokes and low impasto; as well as broken strokes where the paint was lightly dragged across the peaks of the underlying paint texture. Sometimes more than one color was picked up on the brush and laid down without any mixing. The strokes of bright-green and bright-yellow paint used throughout the landscape provide an example of this (fig. 20.29). The village is constructed almost entirely from individual short strokes and touches of color, which were applied openly so that the lighter areas of the buildings are actually exposed ground (fig. 20.30). The artist moved back and forth between different areas, working up the composition as a whole. The work incorporates both wet-in-wet and wet-over-dry paint application, and the fact that areas of thick impasto were already surface dry in some places when subsequent paint layers were applied on top (fig. 20.31) suggests that the painting was carried out over a period of time. The artist added a few finishing touches of bright-yellow and bright-green paint to the lower left corner, which were still wet when he signed the work (fig. 20.32).\n\nFor the most part, the composition was built up directly from the initial lay-in without any major alterations as the painting progressed. Only a few minor changes were observed. For example, in the middle ground, the position of the bell tower was relocated from the immediate right of the main foreground tree trunk to the left side of it (fig. 20.33). This could reflect a change in the artist\u2019s vantage point after he had started the work, or it may have been an aesthetic or compositional decision. Traces of the first tower are visible in the form of vertical ridges of slightly thicker paint (fig. 20.34). There are also small areas of cream and pale-pink paint similar to that used for other buildings, which remain visible through breaks in the brushwork of the water that was applied on top (fig. 20.35). The undisturbed vertical ridges of the brushstrokes indicate that the paint from the tower was set up when the water was painted on top. The final bell tower was painted on top of the already-dry blue paint of the water in that area (fig. 20.36). These observations indicate that some time passed between the first painting of this area of the composition and the revisions. At the far right side of the village, there are some green, pink, and yellow strokes of paint visible underneath the water (fig. 20.37), which seem to indicate that the buildings and adjacent landscape may have extended further into the water in this area at an earlier stage of the painting. Other minor changes include a slight emendation to the lower contour of the diagonal tree trunk in the area where it passes over the water, just left of center. Here, the blue paint of the water to the right was extended over the lower edge of the trunk, making it narrower in that area, and the upper edge of the trunk was subsequently broadened slightly, with the result that the trunk dips less than it originally did in that area (fig. 20.38).\n\nAn intermittent band of pale-blue paint, on the left side near the top edge, appears to be the result of paint transfer, possibly from an easel cleat or transporting device (fig. 20.39). A few areas of scraping into soft paint were observed along the bottom edge. These marks appear to be incidental, probably related to handling of the work when it was still wet (fig. 20.40).\n\nBrushes including 0.5 and 1 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several brush hairs are embedded in the paint layers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue, and ultramarine blue. Areas of pinkish-orange UV fluorescence indicate that red lake was used in localized touches in the trees. A non-UV-fluorescing, deep-red lake was also observed in the shadowed areas at lower right and in the tree trunks and branches.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe painting has an even, slightly glossy, synthetic varnish, which was applied in 1966. There are residues of yellowed natural-resin varnish in the recesses of the paint texture. The natural-resin varnish was probably applied during the 1922 treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nAn undated memo in the conservation file states that the painting was cleaned and varnished in 1922.\n\nThe earliest examination report, dated 1957, indicates that the painting was already lined by that date. There are no further records indicating when the lining was carried out. The 1965 examination report states that the lining was aqueous (glue).\n\nIn 1965\u201366, discolored surface films were removed. The previous lining canvas was removed mechanically, resulting in some holes at weak spots in the original canvas, which were filled with a brown gesso. The canvas was wax-resin lined and stretched on a new ICA spring stretcher. A spray coating of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Losses were inpainted. A spray coating of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final spray coating of AYAA.\n\nThe painting is in good condition but has been impacted by previous damage and conservation treatments. The canvas is wax-resin lined and stretched taut on an ICA spring stretcher with no planar deformations. There are three vertical tears, ranging from 3 to 10 cm long, located approximately 10 cm in from the right edge, just inside the stretcher bar. The tears seemingly occurred while the artist was still working on the canvas, as original paint appears to span the damaged areas. The original tacking edges are deteriorated with tears and losses in the fabric and splits at the foldovers. There are numerous tiny losses of ground and paint layers throughout the painting. There are several places near the edges where tiny flakes of crushed and displaced ground and paint are adhered to the surface in thick wax-resin adhesive residues from the lining. There are also a few areas of flattened and moated impasto and crushed paint, which probably also occurred during lining. All of the previous damages and insecurities are stable. Cracking is minimal and, where present, is very fine and mainly visible only under magnification. Cracks are slightly more pronounced in areas of thick impasto. There are yellowed varnish residues in the recesses of the paint texture. Synthetic varnish applied in 1965/66 provides an even, saturated, slightly glossy surface. There is retouching around the edges; this is particularly extensive along the bottom. Several small, localized areas of mismatched retouching are visible within the painting. These appear to have been applied mainly to areas of loss where the canvas was exposed.  \nKimberely Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed in 2007): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Proven\u00e7al), late-seventeenth\u2013early-eighteenth-century, Louis XIV frame with carved acanthus-leaf corners linked by foliate scrollwork and strapwork with flowers on a quadrillage bed with a sanded frieze and an acanthus-leaf-tip-and-flower sight molding on a recut fluted ground. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso. The ornament and sight moldings are selectively burnished; all other gilding is matte. The frame retains its original glue size. The carved fruitwood molding is mitered with angled dovetails. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is leaf-tip outer molding; scotia side; ogee with carved acanthus-leaf corners linked by continuous foliate scrollwork and strapwork with flowers on a quadrillage bed; sanded front frieze: ogee with carved acanthus-leaf tip and flowers on a recut fluted ground (fig. 20.41).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed in 2007): The work was previously housed in an American, twentieth-century, stylized, late-nineteenth-century, French-inspired molding frame with cast plaster foliate ornament and cove sight edge. The frame has both water and oil gilding with heavy toning (fig. 20.42).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1933): In the Century of Progress exhibition (1933\u201334), the painting was displayed in a late-nineteenth\u00ad\u2013early-twentieth-century, Louis XIV Revival, convex frame with deeply recessed cast plaster acanthus-leaf corners, foliate and fleur-de-lis ornament, and independent fillet liner with cove sight (fig. 20.43).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Isidore Montaignac, Paris, as the agent for Knoedler and Company, New York, Sept. 1891.\n\nSold by Knoedler and Company, New York, to Potter Palmer, Chicago, Sept. 1891.\n\nBy descent from Potter Palmer (died 1902), Chicago, to the Palmer family.\n\nGiven by the Palmer family to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1922.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Paris, Georges Petit, 6e exposition internationale de peinture et de sculpture, May 8\u2013June 8, 1887, no cat. no.\n\nBoston, Copley Society, Loan Collection of Paintings by Claude Monet and Eleven Sculptures by Auguste Rodin, Mar. 1905, cat. 18, as Bordighera, 1884.

Of the forty-five paintings brought back from his Riviera trip, twenty-one were purchased by Durand\u2013Ruel for 18,200 francs, including the two other versions. See Paul Hayes Tucker, Claude Monet: Life and Art (Yale University Press, 1995), pp. 120; 231, n. 36. It is also possible that Monet preferred to hold on to the Art Institute canvas. According to Wildenstein, twenty-two paintings were sold to Durand-Ruel. Thirteen are listed in a letter from Monet to Paul Durand-Ruel dated May 30, five of which had already been delivered. Nine are listed in a letter to Durand-Ruel dated June 14 (which were delivered on June 12). All sold for a total of 18,300 francs.

(Kimbell Art Museum/Rizzoli, 1997), p. 74. Stuckey goes further, suggesting that the absence of attention given to Monet\u2019s dialogue with C\u00e9zanne around the time of the Bordighera campaign is a gap in the history of Impressionism.

Hamilton indicates in the 1883 guide that Les motifs artistiques de Bordighera was previously published in two successive editions of his guidebook, Bordighera in gennaio, vade mecum del forestiere.

Changing the composition so that the trees would not block the view and making the sea appear more prominent corroborates the artist\u2019s frustration at not being able to see the sea to paint it. As he commented to Alice in a letter from January 27, \u201cand the sea always and even still more blue; no, it cannot be described. As to painting it, one must not think of it, these are effects of too short duration which cannot be found again.\u201d See Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 234, letter 395, translated in Steven Z. Levine, Monet, Narcissus, and Self-Reflection: The Modernist Myth of the Self (University of Chicago Press, 1994), p. 40.\n\nWhile Monet depicts pine trees in the Chicago picture, the region was most noted for its olive, lemon, and palm trees. See C. B. Black, The South of France, East Half, including the Valleys of the Rh\u00f4ne, Dr\u00f4me and Durance . . . and the Passes between France and Italy, 4th ed. (Adam and Charles Black, 1885), p. 201, which notes, \u201cThe great feature of Bordighera are its plantations of palms, whose tufted tops wave above the more lowly lemon trees laden with pale yellow fruit, while the whole of the background is crowded with vigorous olive trees. Some of the palms are 800 years old. The lemon, after the olive, is the most profitable tree.\u201d\n\nSee Daniel Wildenstein, Claude Monet: Biographie et catalogue raisonn\u00e9, vol. 2, Peintures, 1882\u20131886 (Biblioth\u00e8que des Arts, 1979), p. 252, letter 489. On Monet\u2019s final work on the canvases back in his Giverny studio, see Daniel Wildenstein, Monet, or The Triumph of Impressionism, cat. rais., vol. 1 (Taschen/Wildenstein Institute, 1996), p. 201.\n\nFor an overview of the materials and methods of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, see Kimberley Muir, Inge Fiedler, Don H. Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture includes lead white, viridian, vermilion, and iron oxides. The dark hue, in combination with the detection by XRF of traces of calcium, could indicate the presence of bone black; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bordigh\\_22\\_426\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 4, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAs observed in several other Monet paintings examined for this project, the corners and edges of his canvases were often left in a more sketchy state, with areas of ground left exposed. John House, Monet: Nature into Art (Yale University Press, 1988), p. 171, notes that \u201cMonet\u2019s stepson J.-P. Hosched\u00e9 . . . insisted on several occasions that, in the studio, \u2018[Monet] signed his pictures and painted the edges of his canvases which he tended not to paint right up to their margins.\u2019\u201d\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_426\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 16, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat.(National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Bordighera (W854/1922.426),\u201d Oct. 2011.\n\nThe stronger cusping on the right edge may be primary cusping, related to the attachment of the larger piece of canvas (from which this canvas was cut) to the commercial priming frame (see Ground Application).\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatment.\n\nIn areas where a double application was indicated, the composition appears to be similar in both regions. The ground layer was analyzed using SEM/EDX, PLM, and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_426\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 16, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_426\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\" May 16, 2014; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bordigh\\_22\\_426\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 4, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, vermilion, emerald green, viridian, cobalt blue (PLM, SEM/EDX, XRF); chrome yellow (PLM, XRF); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). XRF detected traces of iron throughout the painting; however, further analysis would be required to determine the source. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. Paint scrapings taken in 1976 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. For detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1922\\_426\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 16, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \"1922\\_426\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_Results,\" Nov. 13, 2013; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_Bordighera\\_22\\_426\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Aug. 4, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nIdentifying the specific type of lake used only by its fluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, ed.

See also Ruth Johnston-Feller, Color Science in the Examination of Museum Objects: Nondestructive Procedures (Getty Conservation Institute, 2001), p. 207.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
