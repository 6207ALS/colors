Robinson, 1947.906\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">Transparent amethyst glass. Blown and tooled. Flared rim is rounded by reheating and infolded, then tooled and pulled out into a pointed spout. A long cylindrical neck spreads into a flattened ovoid body and is tooled at an angle to the body. A tail is pulled out from the vessel to form a horizontal rounded end that retains the impression from the pointed tool; the bottom of the body is flattened, no pontil mark. For a zoomable image, see fig. 113.1.\n\nPart of the rim is restored, there is some incrustation and large patches of bright iridescence.\n\nEarly bird-shaped vessels were blown with a closed head and were made to contain white powder (gypsum or chalk) used as foundation, red powder (henna or madder) as eye or lip color, or scented oils that could be extracted only by breaking the tail or head of the vessel. This bottle is a variation on that form, with a tooled rim and spout; it could be reused and probably dispensed small quantities of oil or other liquids. Related but less birdlike are more substantial bottles with vertical necks and bodies pulled out to form a tail spout. These are often referred to as gutti or baby feeders. The form is dated to the Flavian period, and the spouted variety in the Art Institute\u2019s collection may be contemporary or a bit later.\n\nThere is a colorless glass bird in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and a very pale green bird in the Corning Museum of Glass. There are parallels in the Toledo Museum of Art and the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto. There is also an interesting variation on the spouted vessel in the Miho Museum in Shiga, Japan. The form has an upright neck that meets the body at a right angle and a rather short, tooled tail with a rounded tip. A marbled glass variation with transparent purple and opaque white glass appears to be a unique example in a private collection in the Netherlands.  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Rijksmuseum van Oudheden, \u201cRoman Glass Bottles Shaped Like Birds,\u201d available at http://www.rmo.nl/english/exhibitions/archive/at-first-sight/highlights-of-the-exhibition/roman-glass-bottles.\n\nSee Antonaras, Fire and Sand, p. 165, nos. 234\u201335, which seem more suited for filling oil lamps or something less risky than trusting that a baby could not break the glass tip.\n\nIsings, Roman Glass from Dated Finds, p. 27, form 11.\n\nSee Israeli, Ancient Glass in the Israel Museum, p. 118, no. 110; Whitehouse, Roman Glass 1, pp. 120\u201322, no. 188, for a similar form and an extensive discussion of its use and list of parallels; no. 187, for an example of the closed form and a discussion of its use and list of parallels.\n\nToledo Museum of Art, acc. no. 1923.1228.\n\nHayes, Roman and Pre-Roman Glass, p. 54, no. 118, pl. 9.\n\nMiho Museum, Ancient Glass, pp. 98, 164, 203, no. 131.\n\nBijnsdorp, Fascinating Fragility, p. 131, no.
