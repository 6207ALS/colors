    "description": "<p>Lively abstract floral forms punctuate the rhythmic geometry at work in Christy Matson\u2019s <em>Rose Knot Variation</em>. The design demonstrates Matson\u2019s layered interests in historic textiles, the gendered history of weaving, and the value of materials. To produce the overall pixelated pattern, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72140\">Matson borrowed from designs</a> popularly used in the production of American woven coverlets, particularly those made in the first half of the nineteenth century. These coverlets, often used on beds and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/10486\">commonly made of a plain cotton or linen and an indigo-dyed wool</a>, could be purchased or handwoven in the home. Matson examines the history of these domestic objects and considers the role of women in keeping and preserving them. The softly curving, feminine floral forms that she emphasizes through her use of painted paper thread hint at the invisible role of women in the history of weaving and caring for these objects. Men who wove and sold coverlets were considered successful entrepreneurs, while coverlets woven by women frequently fell within the confines of typical domestic duties. Furthermore, through her use of surplus and deadstock materials (often leftovers from the fashion industry), Matson addresses the ecological implications of industrial textile production and questions the waste that results from mass manufacturing. Her work invites a reevaluation of textiles and the labor involved in their production and care.</p>\n",
