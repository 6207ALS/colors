A particularly beautiful example of a banded agate amphoriskos can be found in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (fig. 1). There are numerous examples of these fragments in many museum and private collections, including the Corning Museum of Glass, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Toledo Museum of Art. The collection of ribbed bowl fragments in Toledo is substantial; a small selection of those fragments was published by David Grose in 1989. An interesting range of color and form can be found in the Princeton University Art Museum. An example of a complete ribbed mosaic glass bowl imitating agate is in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles (fig. 2), and a footed ribbed bowl on a base is in the Met\u2019s collection (fig. 3). Also in the Met is a rare, complete mosaic glass bowl imitating onyx; this is a Hellenistic vessel that predates these later ribbed forms (fig. 4).  \nSidney Goldstein\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Goldstein, Pre-Roman and Early Roman Glass, pp. 189\u201391, nos. 503\u201316, plates 26, 41.\n\nNew York, Metropolitan Museum of Art, acc. nos. 91.1.1737, 91.1.1643, 91.1.1783, 91.1.1658, 91.1.1666, 81.10.154, 91.1.1799, and 91.1.1794 represent a series of plain and ribbed bowls imitating agate.\n\nGrose, Early Ancient Glass, pp. 269\u201384, nos. 250\u2013314, pp. 214\u201317 (color pl.), cover ribbed mosaic bowls that imitate stone as well as those that have more complex floral patterns.\n\nAntonaras, Fire and Sand, pp. 60\u201361, nos. 28\u201329, 31\u201335.\n\nCarboni et al., \u201cArs Vitraria\u201d, p. 21.\n\n</section><section id=\"figures\">Two fragments of bowls, both late 1st century B.C./mid-1st century A.D., from left: cat. 88, cat. 89.\n\nfig. 1 Amphoriskos (Perfume Bottle), late 1st century B.C./early 1st century A.D.
