He can be identified by his distinctive helmet, which here is richly carved with imagery alluding to his martial role. The<br>sides depict griffins, winged beasts associated with his vengeful nature, while the cheek pieces are each adorned with an image of Cupid carrying a spear and shield. Mars was closely associated with Cupid\u2019s mother, Venus, the goddess of love, whose domain also included warfare and military victory.</p>\n",
