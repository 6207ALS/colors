    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This monumental vase with its lavish decorations was obviously designed to make an unforgettable impact. It was made in 1813 at the celebrated S\u00e8vres porcelain manufactory just outside Paris which produced only a few such large and technically challenging pieces. The vase\u2019s elegantly elongated form is based on agent Roman vessels and its tall handles end and roundels recalling classical medals or coins. Ancient art and imagery especially that of the imperial Roman period was very fashionable at this time especially in France. Lustrous gilding covers the vase\u2019s white porcelain surface making it resemble gilded bronze. It is decorated with exquisitely detailed flowers, foliage and lifelike birds whose feathers almost seem to quiver as they each draw breath. S\u00e8vres painters were especially celebrated for their extraordinary ability to reproduce incredibly detailed imagery on smooth porcelain. Almost all of the S\u00e8vres vases of this size and period were made as important imperial or diplomatic gifts. This one was presented as part of the peace negotiations between France and Britain at the end of the Napoleonic wars. It was given to the British Ambassador Lord Castlereagh by Talleyrand the French Foreign Minister. Castlereagh eventually inherited the title of Marquess of Londonderry and so this magnificent vase has come to be called after his family name.</p>\n",
