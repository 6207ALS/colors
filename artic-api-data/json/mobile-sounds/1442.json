    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Compare the two carved wood figures in this case.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  Both have round chubby faces. Their poses communicate the restless outgoing energy of a young boy. Each has inlaid eyes made of crystal or glass. These Buddhist figures were created to appeal directly to the viewer on a human level. Originally, they featured brightly colored paint. In Japanese religious art of every era the archetypal figure of a boy deity represents peace, renewal and fertility. In medieval Japan esoteric Buddhism assimilated a number of native boy deities known as D\u014dji. The fifteenth century figure on the right depicts Seitaka D\u014dji. He\u2019s one of several boys who attend Fudo Myo-o an angry deity who represents absolute power over evil. On the left, the late twelfth century figure with his hands clasped is Zenzai D\u014dji. This boy pilgrim strides forward, his robes fluttering as he walks. According to a text named the Avatamsaka Sutra Zenzai visited 53 teachers in his search for the truth. Zenzai\u2019s travels brought him to Potalica [ph?] where he heard the law preached by the bodhisattva Kannon.</p>\n",
