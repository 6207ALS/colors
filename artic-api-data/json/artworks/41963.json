    "description": "<p>Ohkuni Takamasa (1792\u20131871), the host of this print, was one of the most important Japanese philosophers of the 19th century. He was a leading member of the Kokugaku (Nativist) movement and conducted early research into the origins of the Japanese language, becoming an expert on Japanese waka poetry, Sanskrit, Western studies, and Daoism.</p>\n<p>This important print was created in conjunction with two leaders of the Takemoto <em>gidayu</em> school of Kabuki chanters, Takemoto Kumidayu and Takemoto Masadayu. The print was created in honor of the latter, and the illustration depicts him seated on an ox, being led from the stage to his retirement. The collaboration of these three famous cultural figures of the 19th-century, along with the generous amount of relatively expensive metallic powder used in the print\u2019s creation, suggest that the print must have had deep significance to the group that produced it.</p>\n",
