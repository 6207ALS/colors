    "description": "<p>Focusing on time-based media art conservation as an ongoing process, this two-day symposium and workshop invites artists, curators, conservators, technicians, scholars, collection managers, and registrars to explore how technical and aesthetic decisions impact the preservation of artworks.</p><p>From the selection of formats during production, to the continual reformatting of moving image works, to \u201creconstructions\u201d of works that are partly lost or obsolete, choices of assessment and care are interwoven with how artworks are seen and remembered. Artists can be critical stakeholders in conservation approaches, including repositioning their past works into new contexts or modes of display. Further, the transfer between formats as technological platforms change provides opportunities to revisit an artwork\u2019s identity or assess the underlying attributes of an analog or digital format. <em>UNFOLDING</em> will draw from art history, conservation, artists\u2019 own procedures, and technical fields of expertise with the aim of expanding our collective attention to the in-between moments in the lives of artworks.</p><p>This event is sponsored by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and hosted through the Time-Based Media Initiative at the Art Institute. It is co-organized jointly by the museum\u2019s departments of Academic Engagement and Research, Conservation and Science, Modern and Contemporary Art, Photography, and Architecture and Design.<br></p><p>This event is free but registration is required.</p><p><em>UNFOLDING</em> continues with panel discussions and a workshop on <a href=\"/events/4706/scholars-day-and-workshop-unfoldingproduction-and-process-in-time-based-media-art\" target=\"_blank\">November 1, 9:30\u20136:00</a>.</p><h3><strong><br>Schedule | Panel Discussions</strong></h3><p><strong>2:00 p.m. | Welcome&nbsp;and Introduction from Organizing Committee</strong><br>Maria Kokkori, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>2:15 p.m. | Panel I: Politics of Preservation</strong><br>Jacqueline Stewart, University of Chicago<br>Abina Manning, Video Data Bank, Chicago<br>Liz Johnson Artur, Artist<br>Chairs: Michal Raz-Russo and Antawan Byrd, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>3:30 p.m. | Panel II: Imagining Futures: Reformatting and Reconstructions<br></strong>Beryl Korot, Artist<br>Ina Blom, University of Chicago and University of Oslo&nbsp;<br>Maurice Schechter, Schechter Engineering, New York<br>Philip Vanderhyden, Artist<br>Chairs: Solveig Nelson and Robyn Farrell, Art Institute of Chicago</p><p><strong>5:00 p.m. | Reception</strong></p><p><strong>6:00 p.m. | Encouraged: </strong><a href=\"/events/4741/performance-alexandra-bachzetsischasing-a-ghost\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>Chasing a Ghost</em>, performance by Alexandra Bachzetsis</strong></a><strong><br></strong>A performance in the Chicago Stock Exchange Room, part of <em>Iterations </em>performance series at the Art Institute.
