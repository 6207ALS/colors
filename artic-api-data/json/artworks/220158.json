    "description": "<p>An influential practitioner of what would come to be called\u2014much to his chagrin\u2014 Minimalism, Donald Judd preferred to describe his often sleek, industrially fabricated works as \u201cspecific objects,\u201d neither painting nor sculpture as understood traditionally. His primary form became the box\u2014solid or hollow, enclosed or open\u2014often in exacting, serial arrays. <em>Untitled</em> comprises Judd\u2019s seventh \u201cstack,\u201d a compositional mode that became the signature manifestation of his ideas. Every stack is installed like a spine or column, not only cantilevered out from the wall but also connecting floor to ceiling. Judd sought to banish symbolism from abstraction, intending his work to be experienced physically. This \u201cstack\u201d casts a lush orange glow against the wall around it; as a result, negative space is as much a part of the work as the boxes themselves.</p>\n",
