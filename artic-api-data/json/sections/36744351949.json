Ryerson Collection, 1933.1157\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry\" id=\"curatorial_entry\">In August 1908\u2014less than one year before Claude Monet exhibited the Art Institute\u2019s Water Lilies at the Durand-Ruel gallery in Paris along with almost fifty other paintings of the same motif\u2014the artist was experiencing anxiety about the series. \u201cKnow that I am absorbed by my work,\u201d he wrote to his friend the art critic Gustave Geffroy. \u201cThese landscapes of water and reflections have become an obsession. It is beyond my powers as an old man, and yet I want to arrive at rendering what I feel. I have destroyed some . . . Some I recommence . . . and I hope that after so many efforts, something will come out.\u201d These struggles had already forced Monet to twice postpone exhibiting this series of works. But after a trip to Venice in late 1908 (see cat. 45)\u2014one that allowed him to look at his paintings of water lilies with \u201ca clearer eye\u201d\u2014Monet was finally ready to pronounce them finished.\n\nThe exhibition, which eventually opened on May 6, 1909, and was scheduled to run until June 5, proved to be a great success, so much so that Durand-Ruel wanted to send the show on to London and Berlin; although Monet would not agree to this, the Paris show was extended by a week. Monet called the group of paintings on view Les nymph\u00e9as, series de paysages d\u2019eau (Water Lilies: Series of Water Landscapes). The series, begun in 1903 following a significant renovation of the water garden at his Giverny home, affirmed Monet\u2019s commitment to innovation and his desire to challenge the conventional definition of landscape painting.\n\nThe Water Lilies series that Monet undertook between 1903 and 1908 was not his first engagement with the subject. Nonetheless, they were radically different from his previous depictions of the motif (see Water Lily Pond, cat. 37 [W1628], fig. 44.1). In his earlier treatment of the subject, Monet retained the traditional components of a landscape painting, representing the horizontal zones of water and land, and provided glimpses of the sky above. In each of these works, he grounded the viewer by including the Japanese bridge he had built on the property over the pond, as well as the plantings around its bank.\n\nFrom 1903 onward, however, Monet\u2019s treatment of the motif was much more experimental. Shifting viewpoints, the artist played with the relative proportion of water, land, and sky that remained visible, and in the majority of the works, he altogether eliminated the sky in the upper reaches of the canvas, leaving it discernible only as a reflection in the water (fig. 44.2 [W1656]). As Monet continued with these works, he became increasingly preoccupied with the reflection of the sky in the water, but he retained geographically specific elements that help orient the viewer. For example, in Le bassin des nympheas, at the Denver Art Museum (fig. 44.3 [W1666]), Monet included a sliver of the bank at the top of the canvas. The work in the Dayton Art Institute (fig. 44.4 [W1657]), however, shows no indication of a horizon line; it is Monet\u2019s addition of foliage hanging from overhead that helps to position the viewer on a bank near which the tree or stalk must be rooted.\n\nBut over the course of creating his water lily pond paintings in the period 1903\u201308, Monet included fewer and fewer elements of (nonreflected) reality aside from the water itself. In the Art Institute\u2019s painting, the sky and foliage surrounding the pond are only visible as amorphous and barely decipherable reflected forms. Monet also used canvases that were unconventional for the depiction of landscapes. The close-to-square format used in Water Lilies was not unusual for the artist (he had also used it for the earlier Water Lily Pond [cat. 37]), but the division of the canvas into irregular sections\u2014the water lilies are unconventionally concentrated in the upper right and lower left corners and are divided by a diagonal swath of water in between\u2014creates an otherworldly quality that defies any expectation of axial orientation. Monet pushed this concept even further by making a number of decorative, circular canvases (fig. 44.5 [W1729]).\n\nThe incredible variation of Monet\u2019s viewpoints and the airy quality he incorporated into his water landscapes from 1903\u201308 make them appear effortless. But, as noted above, this belies the fact that Monet struggled intensely with these paintings, something suggested by an account published in 1908 that claimed \u201call those who saw the pictures in February and March considered them \u2018overworked,\u2019 that is, they showed too plainly how long they had stood on the easel.\u201d Indeed, technical examination reveals that Monet worked on Water Lilies over several sessions (see Technical Report). He built up the painting by superimposing layer upon layer of gestural brushwork on the canvas. In raking light, many of these underlying brushstrokes that do not correspond to forms in the final composition are quite evident (fig. 44.6). In the upper right corner of the canvas, it is also apparent that Monet applied at least eight or nine layers of paint in some areas, further revealing the extent of the artist\u2019s complex painting process (fig. 44.7).\n\nMonet\u2019s changing technique and the tremendous effort he expended on the 1903\u201308 series of water lilies is particularly evident when compared to the Art Institute\u2019s earlier Water Lily Pond (cat. 37). Although Water Lilies and other works from the 1903\u201308 group give the impression of being more fleeting and ephemeral than those he created in 1899\u20131900, transmitted-light images show the opposite to be true: in the earlier canvas, Monet left significantly more ground exposed (fig. 44.8). By exploiting the reflection of light off the ground layer, he suggested the transparency of water. In Water Lilies, however, only a very small portion of the ground layer has been left uncovered (fig. 44.9). The semblance of reflective light in the painting was a result of the paint that Monet had applied rather than ground left bare. A comparison of the palette used in these two paintings confirms this observation as well. While at first glance, the 1906 painting\u2014in which the artist incorporated cool blues, purples, and greens over the entire canvas\u2014appears more monochromatic and less flamboyantly colored than the 1900 painting, Monet actually used a similar range of pigments in both. In sum, the painting that appears more planned and even garish\u2014Water Lily Pond, from 1900\u2014was less worked; the one that seems more momentary\u2014Water Lilies, from 1906\u2014was far more labor intensive.\n\nDespite differences in execution and composition, there is a constant in the Art Institute\u2019s paintings of Monet\u2019s water garden from 1900 and 1906: the water lilies, those organisms that symbolize the merging of the aquatic and terrestrial worlds. At times, Monet downplayed the importance of the flora in his water garden paintings, claiming that his true subjects were the light and the weather conditions. As he mentioned in a posthumously published interview: \u201cThe effect does change, constantly, not only from one season to another, but from one minute to the next as well, for the water flowers are far from being the whole spectacle; indeed, they are only its accompaniment. The basic element of the motif is the mirror of water, whose appearance changes at every instant because of the way bits of the sky are reflected in it, giving it life and movement.\u201d Although the water lilies may have been, according to Monet, \u201cjust the accompaniment,\u201d the art historian Paul Tucker has noted that in the Art Institute\u2019s Water Lilies painting, they critically \u201cperform their part by keeping the whole picture buoyant.\u201d Indeed, they play the critical role of designating the transition between that which is above and below the water\u2019s surface.\n\nDespite Monet\u2019s later recollection, Water Lilies demonstrates that the plants were crucial to the way in which he mapped out this canvas. As revealed by the X-ray of the painting, Monet planned a number of the water lily groupings very early on in the compositional process, sometimes directly over the ground layer (see Technical Report). There is also evidence that Monet built up the water around most of the plant groupings, indicating the fundamental role they played in the composition (fig. 44.10). In addition, the water lilies were details that Monet fussed over. In the Art Institute\u2019s painting, there is evidence that Monet initially planned a denser grouping of the plants in the foreground, but that he went back and edited out some of them in order to achieve just the right balance (fig. 44.11).\n\nA period photograph showing a hatted individual\u2019s shadow looming over a water lily pond documents the stance that Monet must have taken when producing works like Water Lilies (fig. 44.12). For the art historian Victor Stoichita, who believes this figure to be Monet, this photograph was \u201cthe symbolic creation of an artistic confession.\u201d By revealing only his shadow in the photograph, Monet was able to \u201cexpress what was intrinsic to his final paintings: the shadow of the gaze, the instigator of painting.\u201d Monet indeed left his autobiographical trace in the Chicago painting. Technical examination of Water Lilies reveals the extent to which Monet acted as the medium and interpreter of nature on this canvas. The touch of his flickering brush on the painting\u2019s surface professes his everlasting artistic presence.  \nJill Shaw\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Claude Monet\u2019s Water Lilies was painted on a pre-primed, non-standard-size, linen canvas. The ground is off-white and consists of two layers. It has a distinct brush-marked surface, which is only visible at the unpainted edges, since the thick buildup of paint obscures the texture of the ground. The painting was carried out in several sessions, working from a rough lay-in of the main water lily groupings and a strongly brush-marked underpainting that was broadly applied throughout the water. The individual lily pads and flowers in the foreground of the composition were painted on top of the water. It appears that the artist originally planned a more dense coverage of water lilies in the foreground area, and then later painted out or partially covered several of the plants. The painting was densely built up in a network of thick, textural strokes and low impasto, with as many as nine distinct paint layers observed in one area.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 44.13).\n\nSigned and dated: Claude Monet 1906 (lower right, in reddish-brown paint) (fig. 44.14). The painting was dry when the signature and date were applied.\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe original dimensions were approximately 89 \u00d7 92 cm. This does not correspond to a standard-size stretcher; both dimensions do, however, correspond to standard stretcher-bar lengths. The stretcher was probably custom ordered.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 27.3V (0.5) \u00d7 27.4H (1.0) threads/cm; the vertical threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the horizontal threads to the weft. No weave matches were found with other Monet paintings analyzed for this project.\n\nThere is mild cusping along the top, bottom, and right sides of the canvas and pronounced cusping along the left edge. Cusping on the top, right, and bottom edges corresponds to the placement of the original tack holes. The strong cusping on the left side does not correspond to the original tack holes and extends beyond the cut edge of the canvas in places.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to 1990 conservation treatment (see Conservation History). Copper tacks spaced 3\u20134 cm apart.\n\nOriginal stretching: Original tack holes spaced 4.5\u20136.5 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Dates to 1990 treatment (see Conservation History). It is a tongue-and-groove, keyable, wooden stretcher with six members including vertical and horizontal crossbars. Depth: 2.8 cm.\n\nOriginal stretcher: Discarded. The pre-1974-treatment stretcher was probably the original stretcher. A 1974 photograph of the stretcher and an examination report in the conservation file record that the stretcher was a Buck type 2, consisting of six members, including a horizontal and a vertical crossbar, with keyable mortise and tenon joints. The report gives the following dimensions: height, 93 cm; width, 89 cm; stretcher-bar width, 6.5 cm; outside depth, 1.5 cm; inside depth, 2 cm; distance from canvas position, 0.5 cm; length of mortise, 6.5 cm (fig. 44.15).\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nNot determined (probably glue).\n\nThe ground layer extends to the edges of all four tacking margins, indicating that the canvas was cut from a larger piece of primed fabric, which was probably commercially prepared. The ground is relatively thick, filling up the canvas weave to some extent. Around the edges, where a border of unpainted ground from the tacking margins was incorporated into the picture plane when the lined painting was restretched onto a slightly larger stretcher (see Conservation History), the ground layer has a visibly brush-marked surface. The brush marking continues underneath the paint layer and to the cut edges of the tacking margins (fig. 44.16). Cross-sectional analysis indicates that the ground consists of two layers. The lower layer ranges from approximately 20 to 100 \u00b5m in thickness. The upper layer ranges from approximately 10 to 35 \u00b5m in thickness (fig. 44.17, fig. 44.18).\n\nThe ground is off-white, with some dark (possibly black and red or brown) particles visible under magnification (fig. 44.19).\n\nAnalysis indicates that the lower layer contains lead white with minor amounts of calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate (chalk), and traces of zinc white, various silicates, silica and alumina. The upper layer contains lead white with minor amounts of calcium sulfate, calcium carbonate (chalk), zinc white, and traces of iron oxide, silica, and various silicates. Binder: Oil (estimated).\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography (IRR) or microscopic examination.\n\nThe painting was densely worked up using thick, opaque brushstrokes. The X-ray shows that the canvas was almost completely covered by a thick buildup of relatively radio opaque brushwork (fig. 44.20). As the transmitted-light image reveals, there are only a few translucent areas near the center of the painting where the light passes through the canvas (fig. 44.21). These are areas where the ground or thin underlayers of paint were left exposed through breaks in the brushwork. Over most of the surface, however, the buildup of brushwork obscures the initial layers of painting and much of the canvas and ground textures (fig. 44.22). A small damage near the upper right corner, which seems to have occurred early on, when the paint was still somewhat soft, provides a cross-sectional view of the paint layers in that area (fig. 44.23). At the edges of the loss, one can see a complex buildup of brushstrokes consisting of at least eight or nine layers of different colors including (from bottom up): green, blue, green, purple, yellow, white, green, purple, and blue.\n\nThe thick buildup of paint makes it difficult to see how the composition was laid in, but throughout the work, where views are permitted, various shades of green paint are visible, lightly brushed directly over the ground layer. This can be seen in areas of open brushwork among the clusters of water lilies (fig. 44.24) and at the edges of the composition (fig. 44.25). In addition to these thinly applied strokes of paint, the artist also laid down some thicker, brush-marked strokes, which, despite being covered by subsequent paint layers, contribute much of the surface texture to the final painting. These strokes were broadly applied throughout the upper two-thirds of the composition (fig. 44.26, fig. 44.27). The texture of the underlying paint is often emphasized by subsequent strokes of relatively flat, solid color, which catch on and accentuate the ridges of the brushstrokes below. This is particularly evident in the areas of reflected foliage in the upper part of the water (fig. 44.28). The fact that the earlier brushstrokes were not disturbed by the later paint applications indicates that they were at least surface dry when the composition was built up.\n\nThe groupings of water lilies in the upper part of the painting and down the right side were planned from early on. As mentioned above, these areas were painted directly over the ground layer or the thin underpainting, and in the X-ray, the paint buildup is less dense since the water was painted around the plants (fig. 44.29). The water lilies in the lower third of the painting were more haphazardly composed, with some parts built up directly over the ground or thin lay-in (fig. 44.30), and others applied on top of the thick, impasted brushwork of the water (fig. 44.31). It seems that Monet was experimenting with the degree to which the foreground surface of the water would be covered with water lilies, as some plants were later painted out of the composition while others were added in the final painting stages. The X-ray shows that this area of the composition was densely built up over a broader area, and although some of the brushwork could be related to the textural underpainting used throughout the work, distinct ovoid shapes suggest that more plants (i.e., individual water lily pads) were painted in at an earlier stage (fig. 44.32). The large grouping at the lower left edge, for example, was initially painted as a larger mass that extended further into the water at the upper right edge (fig. 44.33). Thick blue paint from the water was then applied on top to cover parts of the plants and create breaks in the grouping. Green paint from the painted-over foliage remains visible in a few places (fig. 44.34). Further to the right, where the water lilies are more dispersed, additional ovoid shapes visible in the X-ray suggest that a few more lily pads were initially painted in this area (fig. 44.35). These isolated water lilies all appear to have been painted on top of the thick, textural paint of the water after it was surface dry. Some of the plants were worked up in bright greens with some pink and red strokes, presumably related to the petals of the flowers (fig. 44.36). In one case, the lily pad was only partially painted out, such that the right edge was left exposed; the yellow flower was then added on top (fig. 44.37).\n\nThe water lilies were built up in multiple, superimposed strokes of thick paint applied using both wet-on-wet and wet-over-dry layering, which indicates that the painting was carried out in multiple sessions (fig. 44.38). Where brushstrokes were drawn through wet paint, there is no blending and each stroke retains its distinct form (fig. 44.39). The artist varied the consistency of his paints, using stiffer paint to create thick impasto (fig. 44.40) and soft peaks (fig. 44.41, fig. 44.42), and more fluid applications where colors have swirled together and settled to a smoother surface (fig. 44.43, fig. 44.44). For the flowers, the artist used touches of brilliant color (fig. 44.45) and sometimes picked up multiple unmixed colors on his brush (fig. 44.46, fig. 44.47). There are areas of flattened paint around the edges, suggesting that the work was framed when the paint was still soft. In one area on the left edge, a thick stroke of impasto was squashed when the paint was still wet (fig. 44.48).\n\nBrushes, including 1.0 and 1.5 cm width, flat ferrule (based on width and shape of brushstrokes). Several coarse brush hairs are embedded in the paint layer.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, red lake, viridian, malachite, cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, and cobalt violet.\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nIn 1990, the synthetic varnish layers applied in 1974 were removed; traces of residual varnish were retained in places, however, and a thin retouching varnish was rubbed in locally where blanching had occurred (see Conservation History). Overall, the paint surface has a soft sheen with subtle variations from low gloss to matte depending on the qualities of the paint.\n\nIn 1956, the painting was described as unvarnished and a surface coating was recommended. The pre-1974-treatment-notes mention the presence of a thin, natural-resin varnish, which suggests that varnish was applied some time between 1956 and 1974; the 1974 treatment report mentions only grime removal, however, creating some uncertainty as to the presence of a varnish layer prior to 1974.\n\nIn 1974, surface grime was removed. The canvas was wax-resin lined and restretched on an ICA spring stretcher. A layer of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA was applied. Inpainting was carried out. A layer of methacrylate resin L-46 was applied, followed by a final layer of AYAA.\n\nIn 1990, the synthetic varnish layers were partially removed; a residual trace of varnish was retained because complete removal resulted in blanching of the paint surface. Some blanching formed in the paint interstices in an area approximately five inches in diameter located in the upper left quadrant. Attempts to remove the blanched material were ineffective, so a thin retouching varnish was rubbed into the areas of blanching. The painting was removed from the ICA spring stretcher and remounted on a keyed tongue and groove stretcher prepared with a loose lining fabric.\n\nThe painting is in good condition. It is wax-resin lined and loose lined. The canvas is stretched taut, and there are no planar deformations. The tacking edges are moderately worn, especially around the original tack holes, and there is some loss and abrasion of the ground layer, especially along the original foldovers. There are old paper and glue residues on the edges. The paint layer is in good condition. There are a few very small paint losses, including a series of roughly circular losses of paint and ground at intervals along the bottom edge. There are also some localized areas of interlayer cleavage. Some areas of crushed impasto are probably due to the lining procedure, but for the most part the impasto remains intact. There are fine cracks throughout the work, especially spanning thick brushstrokes, as well as stretcher-bar cracks, which are especially prominent in the area of the original vertical crossbar. Some of the cracks have slightly raised edges, but the paint layer is secure. There are some starch-paste residues from the lining procedure in the recesses of the paint texture and facing-paper residues in the upper left corner. There are remnants of old retouching around the edges, although this was mainly removed in the 1990 cleaning. The painting is currently unvarnished.  \nKimberley Muir\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2008): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a reproduction of a French (Parisian), late-nineteenth-century, architrave frame with cast imbricated and centered laurel-leaf ornament with acanthus-leaf miters. The frame was modeled on a Monet frame from 1881. This frame type also appears in studio photographs framing other water lily paintings. The frame is water gilded over red bole on gesso and cast plaster ornament. The sight molding is burnished, with selective burnishing on the laurel leaf ornament, all other gilding is matte. The gilding is lightly toned and has a glue size. The jelutong-wood molding is mitered and nailed. The molding, from perimeter to interior, is cove; fillet; torus with cast imbricated and centered laurel-leaf ornament with acanthus-leaf miters; fillet; and cove (fig. 44.49).\n\nPrevious frame (installed 1991; removed 2008): The work was previously housed in an American, carved reproduction of a French, late-nineteenth-century, architrave frame with a centered guilloche ornament (APF Inc., New York, 1991) (fig. 44.50).\n\nPrevious frame (installed by 1975; removed 1991): The work was previously housed in an American, mid-twentieth-century, L-shaped, narrow frame with a gilded face on a mahogany molding with exposed splines at the miters. The frame may be a design by James L. Speyer (fig. 44.51).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Durand-Ruel, Paris (3/4 interest), and Bernheim-Jeune, Paris (1/4 interest), June 3, 1909, for 14,000 francs.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Henri Bernstein, Paris, May 29, 1909, for 20,000 francs.\n\nSold by Henri Bernstein, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Aug. 9, 1909, for 20,000 francs.\n\nOn deposit from Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Apr. 1911.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, Paris, to Durand-Ruel, New York, Feb. 10, 1914.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

Johnson, and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cAn In-depth Study of the Materials and Technique of Paintings by Claude Monet from the Art Institute of Chicago,\u201d ICOM-CC 17th Triennial Meeting Preprints, Melbourne, Sept. 15\u201319, 2014 (forthcoming).\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nXRF analysis, in conjunction with microscopic examination of the painting surface, indicates that the paint mixture contains lead white, vermilion, red lake, and viridian; other pigments may also be present. See Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WLilies\\_33\\_1157\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1157\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions of the painting were based on a visual estimate of the original foldovers.\n\nThread count and weave information determined by Thread Count Automation Project software; see Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Claude Monet, Water Lilies (W1683/1933.1157),\u201d Dec. 2011.\n\nThis suggests that the cusping on the top, right, and bottom edges is related to the mounting of the canvas on the original stretcher (i.e., secondary cusping), while the cusping on the left edge may be primary cusping, related to the stretching of the larger canvas (from which this canvas was cut) on the commercial priming frame.\n\nThe height and width dimensions appear to have been reversed in this report.\n\nSee examination record of auxiliary support, n.d., on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of a sizing layer is difficult to determine from cross sections due to previous conservation treatments, such as wax-resin lining.\n\nThe fact that the brushmarking continues onto the tacking edges indicates that the layer was applied before the canvas was mounted on the stretcher. Furthermore, on the left edge, the brush marks appear to deform in correspondence with the cusping pattern of the canvas, which further supports the hypothesis that the layer was applied before the canvas was stretched.\n\nTraces of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon were detected in association with the calcium particles and are believed to be impurities often associated with the chalk. The ground composition was analyzed using SEM/EDX and XRF. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1157\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2014; and Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WLilies\\_33\\_1157\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe pigments were identified by the following methods: lead white, cadmium yellow, chrome yellow, vermilion, viridian, malachite, cobalt blue (PLM, XRF); cobalt violet (PLM, XRF, electron microprobe); red lake, ultramarine blue (PLM). Electron microprobe analysis conducted in 1975 confirmed that the cobalt violet pigment is a cobalt arsenate. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1157\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2014, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Paint scraping samples taken in 1974/75 were reexamined by PLM in 2013. Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting. For more detailed results and conditions used, see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1157\\_Monet\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d May 23, 2014; Inge Fiedler, \u201c1933\\_1157\\_Monet\\_PLM\\_results,\u201d Oct. 22, 2013; Kimberley Muir, \u201cMon\\_WLilies\\_33\\_1157\\_XRF\\_Results,\u201d Dec. 13, 2011, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Monet\u2019s technique and published analyses of Monet paintings in other collections.
