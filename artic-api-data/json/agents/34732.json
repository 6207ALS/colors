    "description": "<p>The son of a civil engineer, Art Green originally enrolled in the School of the Art Institute of Chicago as a design student but transferred to painting and drawing halfway through his first year.</p><p>Inspired by Chicago\u2019s architectural and cultural fabric, his engagement with the political turmoil of the 1960s found its way into his work more overtly than that of any other fellow Hairy Who artist.</p><p>Soon after graduation, Green joined forces with five other recent graduates of the School of the Art Institute to form the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/114577/the-hairy-who-art-green-gladys-nilsson-jim-nutt-jim-falconer-suellen-rocca-and-karl-wirsum\" target=\"_blank\">Hairy Who</a> in 1965.

Over a period of four years they transformed the art landscape of Chicago, injecting&nbsp;their new and unique voices into the city\u2019s rising national and international profile.</p><p>As a part of his artistic practice, Green collected reference materials including commercial signage, postcards, and magazine advertisements. He was attracted to their bold, ironic, and suggestive graphic statements, which he absorbed and reinterpreted in drawings, paintings, and prints.</p><p>Green uses line to portray three-dimensional forms. Flat planes of color, as well as volume, are conveyed with graphic conventions such as hatching. The complex spatial relationships and deep space of Green\u2019s compositions distinguish his work from that of fellow Hairy Who artists.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href=\"/exhibitions/2722/hairy-who-19661969\">2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute\u2014the first-ever major survey dedicated solely to the Hairy Who\u2014explored how the group\u2019s distinct aesthetic transformed the art landscape of Chicago.</p>",
