    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Have you seen this couple before? Almost everybody has, or other people pretending to be these two. The painter, Grant Wood, used his sister, Nan, as the model for the lady, and his local dentist, Dr. Byron McKeeby, as the man. Wood called his finished painting &quot;American Gothic.&quot; The gothic part of the name comes from the building behind the couple. See that skinny, stretched out window on the second floor? The shape is called gothic. What else can you find that's skinny and stretched out? How about the couple? Wood stretched their faces to match the shape of the window. When &quot;American Gothic&quot; first appeared in 1930, people either loved it or hated it. The people who loved it thought Grant Wood had made a nice portrait of life in the country. The people who hated it thought he was making fun of country life. What do you think Grant Wood was saying about life on the farm? Well, the more people argued, the more famous this couple and this painting became. And before long, &quot;American Gothic&quot; was called an American icon. An icon is an image that everyone can recognize, and in this case have fun with. That house in the background is a real house in the town of Eldon, Iowa. People pose outside and get their pictures taken so they can have their own version of &quot;American Gothic.&quot; Can you think of any other images that are American icons?</p>\n",
