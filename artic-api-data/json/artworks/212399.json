    "description": "<p>The Hungarian-born artist L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Moholy-Nagy was one of the most influential art teachers in Germany in the 1920s. He taught from 1923 until 1928 at the Bauhaus art school, which united traditional artisanal workshops with industrial manufacturing and mechanical reproduction. Moholy's book <em>Painting, Photography, Film</em>, published in 1925 and again in 1927, argued that film and photography could give essentially new perspectives on art and contemporary life, if only their basic principles were fully understood and exploited. This photomontage is exceptional in its use of ink and in its relatively full composition\u2014many of Moholy\u2019s montages exploit blank space. However, it exemplifies his association of photomontage with the fast pacing and high-keyed humor and terror of the movies.</p>\n",
