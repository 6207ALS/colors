In November forty-one paintings and assorted wood sculptures on Tahitian themes, along with three Brittany-related paintings, were shown in Paris at Durand-Ruel. Only three paintings sold.\n\nWhen the exhibition closed, the unsold works returned to Gauguin. As photographs of his Paris studio at 6, rue Vercing\u00e9torix (see fig. 58.1, fig. 58.2, and fig. 58.3), and eyewitness accounts confirm, Gauguin had painted the walls a bright chrome yellow. The studio also housed paintings and woodcarvings from Gauguin\u2019s Tahitian sojourn that were not exhibited at Durand-Ruel. Thus, by simply looking around his studio, he could select motifs from the array of art displayed on the walls, as well as stacked on the floor, creating a brilliantly colored environment that documented, as well as romanticized, his encounter with the South Seas. Serving as visual aids, the works allowed him to muse upon his adventures as he spun them for fellow artists and literati, made new and experimental work, and wrote and rewrote his travel account and created the accompanying prints using boxwood matrices.\n\nThe Noa Noa suite was printed in two campaigns during Gauguin\u2019s lifetime\u2014one in 1893\u201394 by the artist himself and the other in 1894 in collaboration with his friend Louis Roy\u2014and received one printing after his death. In 1921 Gauguin\u2019s youngest son, Pola, supervised the publication of a portfolio of black-and-white impressions pulled from eight of the ten surviving boxwood matrices for the suite. Unlike the experimental, expressive, and often hard-to-read impressions made by Gauguin and the limited but often brighter palette of those printed by Roy, Pola Gauguin\u2019s meticulously inked and pulled prints record in a straightforward manner every detail and represent the prints\u2019 final state. However, he was unable to print the eighth image in the series because his father had repurposed the print\u2019s boxwood block in 1896/97, during his second sojourn in Tahiti. Removing the upper-right section of the matrix (see fig. 58.4 [Kornfeld 15]), the artist carved a new image into the reverse, resulting in the print Young Maoris (fig. 58.5 [Kornfeld 39]). Gauguin\u2019s intentions for sequencing the plates in his proposed publication were never clear, which has prompted many theories. For the order of plates presented here, see \u201cVeiled in a Cloud of Fragrance\u201d.\n\nPola Gauguin\u2019s impression of Te fararu (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58.1, cat. 58.2, and cat. 58.3) derives from a detail of Gauguin\u2019s 1891 painting Upa upa (The Fire Dance) (fig. 58.6 [W 433]). Having quoted this work almost in its entirety in Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks), plate 7 of the Noa Noa suite (cat. 57), here the artist focused on the amorous couple seen at the right of that composition.\n\nTe faruru features a seated man and woman intertwining their limbs in an embrace so tight that they seem to merge into one body. Both are naked above the waist, their torsos and legs covered by traditional pareus (the female\u2019s wrap is indicated by decorative motifs at the figures\u2019 left). In addition to this pair, the quotations in the print from Upa upa include, in the upper-right portion of the print, a large bonfire and the plumes of smoke it generates. The title and artist\u2019s monogram are enclosed in a cartouche-like surround that suggests the fire\u2019s licking flames. Out of the thin, undulating lines, representing trails of smoke that move around the shoulders and head of the man, emerges the profile of a tupapau, or evil spirit.\n\nIn formulating his amorous couple for Upa upa, Gauguin may have been influenced by a detail at the far left of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix\u2019s 1824 canvas The Massacre at Chios (fig. 58.7), in which a man and woman, surrounded by wartime death and destruction, cling together for dear life. A simplified, black-and-white reproduction of the iconic work (fig. 58.8) might have been among the visual sources (which he called his \u201csmall circle of comrades\u201d) Gauguin took with him on his first trip to the South Seas. The similarity of Delacroix\u2019s couple to the pair in Te faruru is striking (see fig. 58.7 left and fig. 58.8 left). In addition, Gauguin\u2019s interlocked couple suggests two celebrated sculptures from the early 1880s by Auguste Rodin: Eternal Spring (fig. 58.9) and The Kiss (fig. 58.10). Many works, in a variety of media, by Gauguin reveal his admiration of and indebtedness to the art of Rodin (see for example cat. 60).\n\nThe theme of the embracing couple was apparently so important to Gauguin that he placed the words \u201cIci far\u00f9r\u00f9\u201d prominently in his studio on rue Vercing\u00e9torix. Throughout 1894 Gauguin continued to work with the motif. It is the subject of two ambitious watercolor transfer monotypes (fig. 58.11 [Field 1973 5] and fig. 58.12 left). While the two differ in appearance, they are closely connected. Their one-to-one relationship has been established by tracing the outlines of fig. 58.11 and superimposing the tracing over fig. 58.12 (fig. 58.12 right).\n\nThe wood-block print is very similar to a drawing that Gauguin prepared, along with others, to illustrate, through photomechanical reproduction, the commercial edition of Noa Noa that he was planning (fig. 58.13) [Rewald 78]). Prior to copying the text for chapter 4 of his bound 1893\u20131901 manuscript Noa Noa, Voyage de Tahiti, Gauguin embellished page 67 (folio 38R) with a watercolor illustration of the theme (fig. 58.14). In addition, he pasted a third-state impression onto page 127 (folio 68R) of the travel account (fig. 58.15 [Kornfeld 15 III]). The couple reappears as part of an amalgam of Gauguin\u2019s favorite motifs from his first Tahitian sojourn in the 1894 canvas Mahana no atua (Day of the God) (fig. 58.16 [cat. 72]).\n\nThe man and woman assume a prominent place in a wall decoration at the right of his 1897 painting Te reroia (The Dream) (fig. 58.17 [W 557]), which constitutes the artist\u2019s last known iteration of the theme.  \nPeter Zegers\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section curatorial_entry2\" id=\"curatorial_entry2\">In John Davies\u2019s 1851 Tahitian and English Dictionary, the verb fa\u2018ar\u016br\u016b is listed as meaning \u201cto cause a self trembling, as formerly in the case of the pretended prophets or taura [t\u0101ura].\u201d The current dictionary of the Acad\u00e9mie Tahitienne mentions an adjectival use of the verb, in the name of a dance in which the body trembles, and a transitive use of it, meaning \u201cto cause somebody or something to tremble.\u201d Bengt Danielsson considered this transitive sense to be the basic one and added that \u201cby extension it had, for obvious reasons, at Gauguin\u2019s time become synonymous with To make love.\u201d\n\nThe composition of Te faruru derives from a detail of the painting Upaupa (fig. 58.18 [W 433]) and of the wood-block print Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (fig. 58.19 [cat. 57.1]), both of which represent a traditional Polynesian dance that Europeans found \u201cobscene\u201d and to which Gauguin gave a sacred dimension (see cat. 57, Commentary). The etymological connection of the phrase with dance and prophetic trance\u2014of which Gauguin may well have been aware\u2014is therefore relevant to his title choice. It is reported that Gauguin included an inscription of the words Ici far\u00f9r\u00f9 (\u201cHere fa\u2018ar\u016br\u016b\u201d), a French-Tahitian manifesto, in his studio on rue Vercing\u00e9torix, Paris (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works), which may explain the frequent translation of Te faruru as \u201cHere we make love.\u201d Since Gauguin\u2019s idiosyncratic use of the Tahitian language involved a dose of punning (see cat. 57, Commentary), he may also have connected fa\u2018ar\u016br\u016b with Te fare amu (The House for Eating) (fig. 58.20 [Gray 122]), a decorative relief made for the dwelling in Polynesian style that he built upon his return to Tahiti in 1895: the unusual expression for \u201ceating hut\u201d that he carved in the wood sounds very similar in French to faire l\u2019amour (to make love), a theme that suits the relief\u2019s iconography better than cooking does. In any event, his decorative and programmatic use of the print\u2019s title in Paris culminated in his final house in the Marquesas Islands, the Maison du Jouir (House of Pleasure) (see fig. 58.21 [Gray 132]), which he might have inscribed Te fare faruru had he chosen a Tahitian name for it.\n\nThe \u201cHere we make love\u201d translation led L.-J. Bouge to imagine that Gauguin thought his print could serve as a signboard. This may only have been the case in a metaphorical sense, but there is a resemblance between the composition of Te faruru, with its figures seemingly suspended from a triangular console inscribed with the title and the artist\u2019s monogram, and the composition of traditional wrought-iron signboards (see fig. 58.22). The ornament bearing Gauguin\u2019s monogram has been described as a \u201cstylized plant or flower,\u201d and its lower part looks like a stem with three pairs of leaves, but the cartouche itself approximates the fan shape then popular with artists and that Gauguin used on several occasions (see fig. 58.23 [W 438]).\n\nTe faruru elaborates on the embracing couple visible on the right of Upa upa (The Fire Dance) (see Descriptive Analysis and Related Works, fig. 58.8) and on the left of Mahna no varua ino (fig. 58.24). One may be surprised by this element of repetition within a ten-plate suite, all the more since no direct link between the subject of Te faruru and a passage of the Noa Noa text has been established. On the other hand, the importance of lovemaking in the traditional reputation of the \u201cNew Cythera\u201d and in Gauguin\u2019s account of his stay in Tahiti cannot be overstated. In Upa upa and Mahna no varua ino, the outline of the male figure is indicated in its essentials, but only the thrown-back head of the female can be discerned. Pola Gauguin\u2019s impression of Mahna no varua ino (fig. 58.24 [cat. 57.3]) shows that Gauguin highlighted the side of the man\u2019s head closest to the fire with three parallel gouges, followed by a series of shorter strikes above and by a large, curved form made of many fine lines\u2014probably scratched with a needle\u2014that moves to the left. This luminous and amorphous element, perched on the lover\u2019s head and extending from it, recalls cloud-like shapes that Odilon Redon added with a scraper to the lithographic stones of some of his prints, for example The Infinite Search from his 1886 album Night (fig. 58.25), as well as the apparitions and ectoplasms of the contemporary \u201cphotographers of the invisible,\u201d spiritists, and parapsychologists (see fig. 58.26). An impression of Mahna no varua ino (fig. 58.27 [cat. 57.1]), in which Gauguin used wax to produce chance optical and textural effects, demonstrates that he aimed at expanding this indeterminate element further and wished to endow it with an importance comparable to that of the adjacent cloud of luminous smoke, resembling the \u201ccolumn of fire\u201d into which, in his 1892/93 manuscript Ancien culte mahorie (Ancient Maori Religion), the war god \u2018Oro turns himself (fig. 58.28; see cat. 57, Commentary).\n\nIn Te faruru, this mysterious element has become a series of wave-like shapes, made of parallel lines, on which sits a clearly delineated face in profile with a large, empty eye, long hair, and three short lines on top of the forehead (fig. 58.29 [Kornfeld 15]). The derivation from Mahna no varua ino indicates that these fluid shapes represent plumes of smoke, but their resemblance to waves may nonetheless be relevant. Gauguin was interested in the iconic potential of the surf (see cat. 54, Commentary), which Walter Crane exploited more explicitly and literally in his 1892 painting Neptune\u2019s Horses (fig. 58.30). Gauguin appears to have regarded the seashore as a liminal space favorable to uncanny manifestations (see cat. 59, Commentary).\n\nGiven its insubstantial character as an apparition carried by the smoke or the surf, this face has been interpreted logically as that of a supernatural entity, such as a t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u (see cat. 73, Commentary) or a v\u0101rua \u2018ino, that is, a ghost or an \u201cevil spirit.\u201d Henri Dorra proposed to identify the features used by Gauguin as those of Tefatu, \u201cthe destructive god of the earth and of earthquakes.\u201d Indeed, the transcendent head in Te faruru resembles only vaguely the hooded t\u016bp\u0101pa\u2018u of the painting Manao tupapau (Spirit of the Dead Watching) (fig. 58.31 [W 457]) and the eponymous print (see cat. 60, Commentary), and it differs significantly from the v\u0101rua \u2018ino shown frontally in Parau na te varua ino (Words of the Devil) (fig. 58.32 [W 458]), whereas it is undeniably similar to the profile of Tefatu conversing with the moon goddess Hina in Te atua (The God) (fig. 58.33 [W 458]; see cat. 53, Commentary), including the empty eye, long hair, and what appears to be a flower tucked into the hair above the forehead.\n\nThe positions of the man and woman are difficult to understand and left strangely indeterminate. Stephen Eisenman observed that Gauguin very rarely represented \u201ca pair of tightly interwoven figures\u201d such as this one and \u201cnever depicted lovers, with the exception of a few, small coitus scenes.\u201d The explicit images of sexual intercourse to which he was alluding are part of manuscripts and would only have been shown privately, whereas the Noa Noa Suite was meant for public circulation. Ancien culte mahorie thus contains a schematic pen-and-ink drawing of the creator god Ta\u2018aroa directing a giant phallus toward the correspondingly oversized vulva of his consort, Hina (fig. 58.34), as well as a colored image of a human couple copulating in the corolla of a plant with lateral branches terminated by four-fingered hands (fig. 58.35). Even in this context, Gauguin copied the text accompanying the latter illustration a second time, on the following page, so as to be able to avoid showing the image to certain viewers. His ostentatious contempt of conventions and occasional taste for provocation should not lead one to underestimate his concern for propriety.\n\nThese are reasons to consider Te faruru a representation of coitus, euphemized by means of an opaque disposition of the bodies and of their partial covering with pareus. The man\u2019s thigh pressing against the woman\u2019s back plays a role visually similar to that of Ta\u2018aroa\u2019s leg/phallus in Ancien culte mahorie, which derives from medieval images of monopods (see fig. 58.36). The thrown-back position of the female\u2019s head probably signifies bliss, and the position of the two partners may owe something to representations of the mystical union of the male and female principles in Tantric Hinduism and Tibeto-Mongolian Buddhism (see fig. 58.37). The fact that the two faces do not touch can be contrasted with Edvard Munch\u2019s contemporaneous treatment of the kiss motif (fig. 58.38)\u2014partly in response to Gauguin\u2019s work\u2014which led the Norwegian artist\u2019s friend Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski to write that the lovers\u2019 faces had \u201cmelted into each other\u201d and that one saw \u201conly the area of fusion which looks like a giant ear that became deaf in the ecstasy of the blood.\u201d\n\nThis ambivalent commingling, which corresponded to Munch\u2019s conflicted view of male-female relationships, appears to be absent from Te faruru. But how should one understand the connection between the couple, their action, and the face emerging from the smoke? The situation is ambiguous, and commentators have interpreted it in different ways, while generally agreeing that the face\u2019s presence is \u201cominous,\u201d to quote Eisenman. Some have thought of \u201ctemptation\u201d or \u201cremorse\u201d; for Douglas Druick and Peter Zegers, this floating spirit suggests that \u201cin a fallen world, the passions of physical love are inevitably compromised.\u201d If we admit that the supernatural face represents Tefatu, then it is ominous indeed: he rejected Hina\u2019s plea and decided that humans would die and never be reborn (see cat. 53, Commentary), so the lovers are doomed. However, they can transcend mortality through the act of generation, which Gauguin defended against the accusation of sin by defining it as a continuation of the Creator\u2019s work (see cat. 57, Commentary). It is worth remembering that a French phrase for orgasm is la petite mort (\u201clittle death\u201d), so that the lovers\u2019 ecstasy can be regarded as prefiguring what Gauguin would call, in his 1902 manuscript L\u2019Esprit moderne et le catholicisme (The Catholic Church and Modern Times), a process of \u201cdisincorporation.\u201d\n\nGauguin\u2019s positive view of physical love, as represented in Te faruru, is also expressed in the sensuality of the print, emphasized in his own impressions by the way he used wiping to render the texture and three-dimensionality of the bodies (see cat. 58.1), much like Edgar Degas\u2019s treatment of nudes in his monotypes (see fig. 58.39). The fact that the essential meaning of the plate is centered in the loins is underscored by the red color added to the man\u2019s pareu, by hand in some of Gauguin\u2019s impressions and with the help of a stencil in those printed by Louis Roy (see fig. 58.40 [Kornfeld 15]). This red is already conspicuous in Upaupa, where it can be understood as a reflection of the bonfire and also colorsthe lovers\u2019 faces. In a watercolor transfer monotype on the same theme (fig. 58.41 [Field 1973 5]), the head of Tefatu is not visible but a mostly red, ascending form\u2014possibly a face\u2014replaces it on the right side. Finally, the abstract dimension of the sexual-union theme is made explicit in a series of concentric circles surrounding the right side of the male figure\u2019s back: partly present in the first state of the wood-block print (fig. 58.42), they became more numerous in its subsequent stages and have the effect of placing the lovers\u2019 genital encounter at the center of a rotative movement suggesting primeval energy.  \nDario Gamboni\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">In the catalogue are two entries listing tikis, carved images of a Polynesian god or ancestor.

There is a contemporary description of Gauguin\u2019s studio:\n\nAu fond, \u00e9tait un hangar vitr\u00e9, comportant un rez-de-chaus\u00e9e et deux \u00e9tages. En haut de l\u2019escalier, \u00e0 la hauteur de second, un balcon desservait trois ateliers. Le troisi\u00e8me et dernier de ceux-ci, au bout de balcon, \u00e9tait celui de Gauguin. . . . Au bout de l\u2019antichambre se trouvait l\u2019atelier. . . . Cette assez vaste pi\u00e8ce, enti\u00e8rement peinte en jaune de chrome clair\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014donnait la sensation imm\u00e9diate de l\u2019\u00e9trange et de l\u2019impr\u00e9vue. Sur les murs, balafr\u00e9s de toiles barbares. (At the back was a kind of windowed shed with a ground floor and two upper stories. At the top of the stairs at the second level, a balcony led to three studios. The third and last of these, at the balcony\u2019s far end, was Gauguin\u2019s. . . . An entrance space led to the studio. . . . This rather vast room, painted entirely in bright chrome yellow\u2014chrome no. 1\u2014created an immediate impression of strangeness and unpredicatability. On the walls, smeared with barbaric canvases.)\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), pp. 123\u201324. Colta Ives identified the man at the lower left of fig. 58.2 as Gauguin, wearing the Stetson that he purchased after viewing Buffalo Bill Cody\u2019s Wild West Show at the 1889 Exposition Universelle in Paris; see Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein, The Lure of the Exotic: Gauguin in New York Collections (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2002), p. 12, fig. 18. The facial structure and costume of the man in the photograph are closely related to those of Gauguin\u2019s Self-Portrait with Hat of 1893/94 (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris [W 506]).\n\nThe order presented here\u2014first proposed in Douglas W. Druick and Peter Zegers, Gauguin: Paintings, Drawings, Prints, Sculpture Paul Gauguin: Pages from the Pacific, exh. cat. (Auckland City Art Gallery/Art Institute of Chicago, 1995), pp. 23\u201324\u2014reflects the unfolding of a narrative based on the themes of the ten wood-block prints. Bronwen Nicholson offered another point of view: \u201cDans leur ensemble, les gravures sur bois nous montrent le cycle de la vie \u00e0 la tahitienne, d\u00e9crivant les aspects de Tahiti qui ont saisi l\u2019imagination de Gauguin: la naissance et la mort, l\u2019amour et la procr\u00e9ation, le bain, la qu\u00eate de la nourriture, les l\u00e9gendes tahitiennes\u201d (Taken together, the woodcuts show us the Tahitian life cycle, describing the aspects of Tahiti that had captured Gauguin\u2019s imagination: birth and death, love and procreation, bathing, the quest for nourishment, Tahitian legends). Bronwen Nicholson, Noa Noa, transcription, ed. Pierre Petit (J. J. Pauvert, 1988), pp. 113, 123\u201338.\n\nFor yet another approach, which marries the prints to the way the text is ordered, see Alastair Wright and Calvin Brown, Gauguin\u2019s Paradise Remembered: The Noa Noa Prints, exh. cat. (Princeton University Art Museum/Yale University Press, 2010). In the opinion of Starr Figura, the wood-block prints do not follow a narrative; she divided them into three thematic categories: \u201cportrayals of daily life, night-time scenes of figures communing with or haunted by spirits, and images depicting Tahitian gods and myths.\u201d Starr Figura, \u201cNoa Noa and the Tahitian Idyll,\u201d in Starr Figura, Gauguin: Metamorphoses, with essays by Elizabeth Childs, Hal Foster, and Erika Mosier, exh. cat.

A plaster version of Eternal Spring was featured in the June\u2013August 1889 exhibition at the same gallery that featured work by Rodin and Claude Monet. It is likely that Gauguin saw one or both of these shows.\n\nJean de Rotonchamp [Louis Brouillon], Paul Gauguin, 1848\u20131903 (\u00c9. Druet, 1906), p. 123, transcribed the phrase as \u201cIci far\u00f9r\u00f9.\u201d Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory stated that the artist inscribed the phrase on a painted window in the studio, but she did not provide a source for this assertion.
