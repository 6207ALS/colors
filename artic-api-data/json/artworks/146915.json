    "description": "<p>Bruce Nauman is a wildly influential artist whose work has explored the poetics of confusion, anxiety, boredom, entrapment, and failure since the 1960s. Nauman was a key figure in the experimental film and video movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s with such works as <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184168\"><em>Dance or Exercise Around the Perimeter of a Square (Square Dance)</em></a>. After 1973, film and video become conspicuously absent from his work, replaced largely by language-based neon sculptures. He returned to video more than a decade later, with <em>Good Boy Bad Boy</em>. Of this decision, the artist recalled, \u201cI think it\u2019s because I had this information that I didn\u2019t want to put into a neon sign. . . . I had thought about presenting it as a performance, but I have never felt comfortable with performance. And so video seemed to be a way to do it.\u201d Conceived as a didactic moral statement, the installation employs two actors, Joan Lancaster and Tucker Smallwood, who are presented in close-up, like newscasters, on two separate monitors. Each recites a one-hundred-line commentary on the human condition that includes passages such as \u201cI was a good boy/You were a good boy/We were good boys\u201d and \u201cI hate/You hate/We hate/This is hating.\u201d Directly confronting the viewer, they deliver each repetition with increased emotional intensity, shifting in and out of sync with one another.</p>\n",
