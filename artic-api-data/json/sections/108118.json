Only a few thin lines appear in the area of this folio overlapped by the sheet below (3G), as the right side of the bottom edge reveals. At the center of the folio there are two visible sewing holes. Several pinholes along the top edge and in the lower corners resulted from Ensor\u2019s habit of pinning the sheets together before mounting them on the canvas.
