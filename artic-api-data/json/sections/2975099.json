Frequently citizens of low birth, lictors announced the approach of a magistrate, served as his bodyguards, and carried out his arrests and summonses.\n\nThe figure wears a toga. The quintessential dress of the Roman citizen, this garment was typically worn over a short-sleeved tunic, as in this figure. The voluminous overfold (sinus) of the toga is carefully arranged in a U-shaped form, which is echoed in the smaller loop of fabric (umbo) that hangs over the tightly gathered folds at the waist. This arrangement of the toga was developed during the reign of the emperor Augustus (r. 27 B.C.\u2013A.D. 14) and was worn through the first century A.D. with minor variations. Here the draping of the overfold, which does not extend past the knee, suggests a date in the first half of the first century A.D. The man\u2019s diminutive feet, which are pointed downward and shod in short boots (calcei), project from the lower edge of the toga. In his left hand he carries a bundle of rods (fasces), a symbol of the magistrate\u2019s imperium; they are clearly articulated, taper slightly toward each end, and are bound together at two points with wide bands.\n\nThe lictor\u2019s hairstyle of thick, slightly curved locks arranged over the forehead resembles coiffures worn by Augustus and his Julio-Claudian successors (r. A.D. 14\u201368) (fig. 145.2), further supporting an early imperial date. His large eyes with heavy lids are enhanced with drilled pupils. His head, turned casually to his right, was cast in the round, while the rest of the body is convex, open in the back, and hollow (fig. 145.3, fig. 145.4, and fig. 145.5). It therefore seems likely that the figure was created as an attachment to adorn another object.\n\nThis figure is representative of a number of small-scale bronze figures of lictors dated largely to the early imperial period that are also thought to have functioned as attachments. A particularly close parallel is an example in Munich (fig. 145.6), with its similar draping of the toga, tapered fasces with articulated rods, and hollow back (fig. 145.7). Such bronze figural attachments may once have been parts of compositions that included magistrates, soldiers, barbarians, and other figures, perhaps inspired by contemporary historical reliefs. It is also possible that these figures were incorporated into friezes or furniture, vessels, chariots, large-scale bronze statues, or other monuments. Based on the convex body and pointed feet, the Chicago figure was probably attached to a curved surface.  \nKatharine A.

On the role of Roman magistrates in the Roman Republic and Empire, see Potter, \u201cMagistrates and Officials, Roman.\u201d\n\nFor an overview of the toga and its development over time, see Cleland, Davies, and Llewellyn-Jones, Greek and Roman Dress, pp. 190\u201394; Stone, \u201cToga.\u201d On the costume of the toga and short-sleeved tunic, see Croom, Roman Clothing, pp. 36\u201338, 40\u201348.\n\nThe length of the overfold appears to have extended over time: it reached only to the midthigh in the late first century B.C., and by the mid-first century A.D. it had dropped below the knee; see Stone, \u201cToga,\u201d pp. 17\u201321. A fragment of a bronze relief representing two men wearing togas with overfolds of different lengths (A.D. 50/75; J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, 85.AB.109) suggests the contemporaneous use of draping styles usually associated with different periods; see Herrmann, \u201cRelief with Two Togate Magistrates,\u201d p. 330.\n\nCalcei were traditionally worn with the toga; see Cleland, Davies, and Llewellyn-Jones, Greek and Roman Dress, p. 28; Croom, Roman Clothing, pp. 60\u201361.\n\nDrummond, \u201cFasces.\u201d\n\nIn other small-scale bronze images of lictors, the fasces exhibits variations in form; see Kreilinger, R\u00f6mische Bronzeappliken, pp. 100\u201301. In some cases, it also incorporates a single-headed axe, as seen in an example in the British Museum, London (20 B.C./A.D. 20; 1983,1229.1), in Kreilinger, R\u00f6mische Bronzeappliken, p. 205, cat. 241, pl. 47.\n\nOn the portraits of Augustus and the Julio-Claudian emperors, see Kleiner, Roman Sculpture, pp. 61\u201369 (Augustus), 123\u201339 (Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero).
