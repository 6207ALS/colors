    "transcript": "<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: We\u2019re looking at this wooden lacquered seated Buddha. This is quite a monumental sized Buddha. And it\u2019s particularly striking because of the lacquer and the gilding that you can still see on it. It is worth noticing that the Buddha is seated on an elephant throne. You can see these little elephants popping out from underneath the base of the seat of the Buddha.  And the seat itself is lacquered in bright red. The sculpture is also inset with semiprecious gems.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR:  The Buddha is seated in the lotus position with his right hand in Bhumisparsha or the \u201cearth touching gesture\u201d, calling the earth to witness his enlightenment.</p>\n<p>MADHUVANTI GHOSE: And what is wonderful about this wooden Buddha is the fact that you\u2019re seeing a crowned Buddha from Burma dated to around the nineteenth century. The concept of crowned Buddhas originated in eastern India in the Middle Ages. And became particularly popular in southeast Asia.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The crowned Buddha is a reference to a myth about a cruel arrogant king who lived in the time of the Buddha. By transforming himself into a lavishly attired king the Buddha was able to persuade the cruel king to follow his teachings. In southeast Asia royalty enjoyed semi-divine status so representations of the crown Buddha served as a reminder that even kings must seek enlightenment.</p>\n",
