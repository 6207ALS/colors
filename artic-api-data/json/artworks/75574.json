    "description": "<p>Wang Wen exemplified the life of the scholar-official in Ming dynasty China.  He retired from government service to his lakeside retreat and pursued painting, calligraphy, and poetry. For this painting, Wang Wen wrote a poem (also entitled \u201cSong of a Fisherman\u201d), which includes several allusions to moral integrity. This poem displays the artist\u2019s distinctively fluid, cursive \u201cdraft script\u201d (cao shu). Its first section reads as follows:</p>\n<p>Most men of the world fish with crooked hooks: I alone trust in hooks, but never in fancy baits. After rain, I carry my long pole to the terrace edge and dangle if from among pines and clouds above the ripples of Qi. (translated by Irving Yucheng Lo)</p>\n<p>Qi refers to a river in north-central China. This river is cited in several verses of the Shijing (Book of Odes) \u2013 a compilation of more than three hundred poems datable between about 1000 and 600 B.C that extol men of principle. Government officials often alluded to these poems to convey Confucian teachings.</p>\n",
