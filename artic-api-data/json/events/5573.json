    "description": "<p>Join museum photography conservator Jim Iska for a pop-in learning experience exploring the science of optics. Participants will experiment with optical devices, including a camera obscura, to learn how cameras and the human eye \u201csee\u201d and how artists have used this knowledge to spark wonder and depict three-dimensional space.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the Conservator</strong></p><p>Jim Iska, assistant conservator for preparation and framing of photographs in the department of Conservation and Science, is responsible for the care of the museum's collection of photographs. During his tenure with the museum's photography collection, he has witnessed profound changes in the medium of photography, including the radical transformation from primarily silver-based to digital processes. Iska is also a professional photographer whose work has appeared in a number of exhibitions and publications including <em>The City in a Garden: A Photographic History of Chicago\u2019s Parks</em> and most recently <em>Chicago: Classic Photographs.</em></p><p>This program is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. OISE 1743748.</p>",
