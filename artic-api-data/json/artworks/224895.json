    "description": "<p>Shaped by the countercultural protests of the 1960s and by Conceptual Art, Fred Lonidier is an activist-artist who utilizes photography to address practical goals\u2014such as changes in the law\u2014while working both within and beyond traditional art-world formats and venues. His work has been exhibited extensively in union halls and factory plants in addition to prominent museums and galleries. Playful and biting, <em>Photo License</em> \u201cmisuses\u201d the vanity plate, which had just been introduced in California in the late 1970s, to reflect on the cultural and environmental implications of cars. Lonidier\u2019s agenda is wittily communicated by the framing words Waste, Pollution, Danger, Fetish, Expense, Oligopoly\u2014and the photographs and educational information provided in place of license plate numbers.</p>\n",
