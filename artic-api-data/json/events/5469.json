Her enormous, powerful assemblages, secured together with thin steel trusses and tension cables, explode into space and appear to defy gravity. In her series&nbsp;<em>Our Friend Fluid Metal</em>, Rubins transforms children\u2019s equipment from playgrounds, amusement parks, and coin-operated rides into dynamic, colorful sculptures that uncannily cantilever and bloom out of the ground.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Please note that this is an in-person event that takes place at the museum.</strong></p><p>In accordance with state and City of Chicago guidelines, visitors to the museum are no longer required to wear masks or provide proof of vaccination.
