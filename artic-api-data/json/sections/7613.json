The responses below come from a two-part qualitative study that included a focus group whose participants visited the exhibition in addition to the modern art galleries on the third floor of the museum\u2019s Modern Wing, as well as nearly one hundred qualitative intercepts, in which visitors were observed while inside Shatter Rupture Break and interviewed after leaving the exhibition.\n\nIn their questions the interviewers focused on visitors\u2019 understanding of the overall theme of the exhibition; the time spent in the galleries; areas of engagement and interactivity; the clarity of exhibition materials; potential barriers or impediments; experiences that were appealing, confusing, or unappealing; and thoughts about the exhibition within the larger context the permanent-collection galleries of Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBelow is a selection of visitors\u2019reactions in their own words.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing being upstairs [in the permanent collection galleries]. Picasso?! That was crazy! . . . But to me, that was the extent of the conversation. It was like, \u2018Picasso, you know him? He did this.\u2019 Downstairs [in Shatter Rupture Break] it was more \u2018Why? What encouraged it? What inspired it?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the third floor [in the permanent collection galleries] you are surrounded by these big names and I felt like, \u2018Wow, this is cool\u2019 . . . but down here [in Shatter Rupture Break], it was like \u2018These people are crazy . . . and it\u2019s awesome.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to get the hell out of there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I was in the Wizard of Oz or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was so much stimulation going on that I felt, not panic . . . but [tension].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was very dark and gloomy . . . I loved that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was \u2018darker\u2019 . . . I felt like it was more desperate feeling. I don\u2019t know if I necessarily think that it was bad, the more that I walked around . . . but it didn\u2019t feel like a happy place to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt a little on edge . . . I was drawn in by the film. It\u2019s a little different. Then I thought, \u2018What were they trying to do here?\u2019 I read the sign that talked about fragmenting and how they would take the teeth and blow them up on the screen and that was more interesting than just the normal size of the mouth on the screen. I thought it was really interesting. I really liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt like I really needed to read the plaques, because I was confused by what it was at first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found it less beautiful and for me a bit more important. It\u2019s about creating art and arts placed in the face of technology or in industrial revolution, things are moving faster than art could keep up with and I read a lot of poetry [from the] turn of the century about all the anxiety that artists were feeling at the time and the fragmentation, postmodernism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was \u2018weirded out\u2019 by the video . . . the eyeballs, the legs and feet flipping upside down . . . but that was the intent. It was a frenetic period. That\u2019s why it is hard to feel very serene in the space.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was really interesting . . . I love the idea of changing in our culture at the turn of the century into the 20th century as it is now. It makes you feel kind of uneasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt felt like [Shatter Rupture Break] was different\u2014like it was shattering the norm.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Shatter Rupture Break] was less traditional. . . . It's not just one thing over and over and over and over again. It breaks things up so there\u2019s multiple things for your eye to focus on.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was going to pick out a piece of art for my place, I\u2019d take one from the third floor gallery\u2014but if you want an experience that you\u2019ve never had before, or if you want to learn something, I would go for [Shatter Rupture Break] personally.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me feel like the students at the SAIC [the School of the Art Institute of Chicago] might have curated all of those pieces.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that a younger crowd would have liked the first floor exhibit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [the Art Institute] would get a younger crowd with [Shatter Rupture Break].\u201d\n\n\u201c[Shatter Rupture Break] you know, just being [left to act like] an adult in that place . . . no \u2018don\u2019t touch that\u2019 [feeling]. I think [that\u2019s] because they wanted you to feel that craziness of [it firsthand]. The \u2018Oh, my God. It\u2019s so close. I can like [almost touch it]\u2019 . . . I wanted to touch that chair so badly because there were no barriers telling me not to [touch it], do know what I mean? Then I was just like, \u2018Go everywhere. Just run around.\u2019 And that\u2019s just what I did!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first floor gallery [Shatter Rupture Break] was more engaging [than the permanent collection galleries].\u201d\n\n\u201c[Shatter Rupture Break] was more entertaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say the first floor was a lot more engaging, regardless of the art there. It was a lot more engaging in terms of finding out about the art, because of the quotes it was like a lot more interactive. They had quotes around the descriptions and it was more verbal discussion of what was happening rather than just a translation. It was a bigger font and it just felt more interactive and easier to understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that [Shatter Rupture Break] could teach the third floor something [about interactivity] . . . Maybe it is something as simple as adding social media or check-in spots, or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt enveloped by this form that I am not familiar with. That was a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sense of flow [appealed to me].\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not sure where to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a traditional square.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to see how you guys used the partitions in the space this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way that it was set up . . . with the walls in between . . . there were angles that made you want to explore more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that within that exhibit the experience worked perfectly. It would have felt super-weird if I had to go down a set path in that first floor gallery.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the third floor [permanent-collection galleries of the Modern Wing] you could stand in the corner and see everything. In [Shatter Rupture Break] you really had to keep moving and explore a little bit more to see what was coming up next\u2014which I thought was interesting. It was a good flow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way [Shatter Rupture Break] was set up with the walls in between and angles . . . it made you want to explore more and see what [comes next].\u201d\n\n\u201cSitting by the film was very disquieting . . . I couldn\u2019t even handle it. I couldn\u2019t even look at it anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will say that I was mesmerized by the whole crazy of that video. Also, the way I took it is that art doesn\u2019t have to be beautiful. Some of the stuff you write on the wall it pretty much said that you can paint with a Band-Aid or at least with a bunch of things you can paint with and it [can] still be art. To me that\u2019s what I took from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe video inspired me. It made me feel more creative.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe films were different . . . very modern to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI loved reading the quotes . . . it made me feel more . . . more goose bumps.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The quotes] give you a better feel of what the artist was understanding when they did it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was more of a conversation rather than just \u2018I\u2019m telling you like it is\u2019 . . . It is a much more interactive way to find out more about the art.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one [quote] was almost like reading a love letter.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The quotes] made it feel much more intimate . . . more personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quotes make it feel more personal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the quotes. They really worked for me . . . It made me think about [what] Georgia O\u2019Keeffe was thinking about when these pictures were taken. How she felt about being the model for these things. For example, when she said, \u2018You know, everyone always compliments me on my hands.\u2019 I thought, that\u2019s kind of interesting, something I didn\u2019t know about Georgia O'Keeffe. I thought that the pictures were beautiful, but I didn\u2019t know how to measure the pictures.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really liked getting a perspective from the artists themselves, their words, what they\u2019re saying, what they\u2019re thinking, what their thought process was rather than a description from a student or an academic . . . I felt more connected.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe quotes made me understand that some people don\u2019t necessarily see art as something that\u2019s beautiful . . . that some people make art from pain. That\u2019s what I got from the wall quotes.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t see any paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cI took the brochure because I wanted to learn more . . . I read some of it in there. I will use it as a reference.\u201d\n\n\u201cI grabbed [the brochure] at the end, when I left, because I thought \u2018I need to remember a lot of stuff from in here.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the thematic [approach]. It is nice to see the thematic [approach] rather than just the artist . . . Do a thematic idea and then bring a lot of artists, a lot of works, together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the mix of different kinds of objects or mediums presented.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring this time, we weren\u2019t just painting or drawing. We were doing a lot of experimentation in film, and different aspects. It\u2019s important to have all those together . . . I need all of those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is less traditional\u2014and more interesting, I guess . . . It isn\u2019t just one thing over and over and over and over again. It breaks things up\u2014there are multiple things for your eye to focus on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sound engaged me right away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sound . . . it grabbed me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me feel like \u2018holy shit . . . here we go!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cInitially, I found the audio to be a little too loud upon first entering the space\u2014but then, with the other two films it was fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt transported me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt desperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt definitely set the tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe audio in the back [of the exhibit] grabbed me . . . I could just sit there and listen. It made me imagine this guy . . . in his old school boots . . . . It [transported] me there.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Shatter Rupture Break] felt depressing at first . . . It took me back to Berlin or bad time East Germany, post-Holocaust . . . that\u2019s where I first went when I heard the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe write-ups I thought were very good. The introduction, I think this piece was nicely done.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe often feel this need to have things described to us. I think that this exhibit . . . was refreshing because you could define it on your own terms and enjoy it without being, \u2018Okay, this is a textile from . . . blah, blah, blah.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I would be distracted, completely . . . if [the description were] right next to the work. I would be reading about [the work] first, and then I would be looking at the work. I wouldn\u2019t be getting a first impression.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like timelines . . . . A timeline [would have been useful]. I wasn\u2019t quite sure what time period were we thinking [about here]. [I\u2019d like to] see the painting in a particular timeline . . . Cubism . . . Surrealism . . . when was this all happening?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only other suggestion that I was thinking about, when I was walking through [Shatter Rupture Break], is that the pieces tend to look at this disruption or rupture from particular sorts of lens, right? We didn\u2019t necessarily see people who had been involved in that content of Africa or from the Middle East or from the Americas . . . . Was this only an American phenomenon?\u201d\n\n\u201cShow the art of women globally. Even the U.S. there\u2019s so little of that but also we don\u2019t think of it globally. We think of art as still very male.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey asked you to send feedback via an email to info@artinstitute.com . . . It was hard to follow suit on that unless it was a QR code or a survey that you could send back right away . . . rather than typing out an email address.\u201d\n\n</section>",
