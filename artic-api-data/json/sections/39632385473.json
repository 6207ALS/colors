Although he lamented the poor quality of the indigenous wood that he was able to procure, the planks on which he carved this pair, derived from the same piece of wood, must have been in the best condition among the group of ten blocks. While the grain of the planks is visible in impressions pulled from both, the planks are not as coarse, nor are the irregularities in their surfaces as abundant, as those present in others used for the suite. Even so, these irregularities still set the prints in the suite apart from the more refined wood-carved and wood-engraved images of Gauguin\u2019s Noa Noa Suite (cats. 51\u201360). Gauguin himself wrote that these prints were \u201cmade on some wood planks\u201d and the prints were produced \u201cby a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form.\u201d\n\nGauguin first printed a couple of trial proofs of this wood block, one in ocher ink and the Art Institute\u2019s impression in dark-orange ink. He then printed the first state in an edition of about thirty impressions on thin, translucent Japanese papers\u2014not in the black ink that characterizes the majority of prints in the series, but rather in dark-gray or ocher inks. The production of a large number of first-state impressions in an expanded ink palette suggests that Gauguin had other aspirations for these impressions from early on in their production, and indeed he used them in a most innovative manner by adhering second-state impressions printed on translucent, diaphanous sheets of Japanese paper on top of them (see also cat. 104.2). Elements of the first-state impressions may be read through the second-state impressions.\n\nThe wood block was printed in dark-orange ink to produce this trial-proof impression of the first state.\n\nFor this impression of the first state, before the bird in the upper left was removed from the block, among many other changes that were made when altering the block for the second state (see cat. 105.2), Gauguin reused a sheet of paper that had previously been folded vertically along the right side of the composition 34 mm in from the right edge. In printing, the ink gathered along the crease to form an orange line that extends beyond the image at the top and bottom. The paper is a medium-weight, machine-made cream wove paper that is a bit thicker than the one used for the Art Institute\u2019s first-state impression of Change of Residence (cat. 104.1).\n\n164 \u00d7 277 mm (image); 184 \u00d7 297 mm (sheet)\n\nThe finely incised lines in this first-state impression suggest that this particular plank of wood may not have been as soft and easily chipped by Gauguin\u2019s tools as others in the group. His incising appears throughout, especially in the dog at left and in the crossed legs and hair of the figure at right (fig. 105.1.2). When he altered the block to produce the second state, Gauguin gouged away many of the more finely incised passages, perhaps to make this composition more visually consistent with the rest of the group. In effect, he turned a tone block into a line block.\n\nAlthough there is a large tear visible on the verso at bottom center that extends 70 mm diagonally into the sheet, the paper fibers are not torn all the way through to the recto. At some point the torn paper fibers were set down with adhesive and burnished into place. In raking light this area appears only as a soft indentation on the recto. The preexisting crease present in a large number of impressions of the late wood blocks has been misunderstood as damage as well and similarly burnished and flattened by a later hand (fig. 105.1.3).\n\nThe sheet has been scored along the vertical edge directly to the left of the printed image; however, it does not travel through the sheet to the verso. There are several diagonal creases on the verso; these appear only faintly on the recto. Also on the verso there is olive-green printing-ink offset that was transferred from another surface.\n\nThe print is in sound, stable condition. In raking light, the various undulations and creases in the sheet become more pronounced.  \nHarriet K.

Annie Joly-Segalen, introduction by Victor Segalen (G. Falaize, 1950), p. 151, no. 59.\n\nWhile Gauguin lamented that it was difficult to find wood, he was referring specifically to wood suitable for wood-block printing. Indigenous wood was soft, and for an artist accustomed to using extremely hard end-grain boxwood, this departure would prove challenging. In fact, close study of the prints he produced in response to this dilemma reveals that he modified his techniques to exploit the specific attributes of his materials.\n\nGauguin wrote to Vollard in January 1900: \u201cHalf of the blocks have been used twice and I am the only person who can make prints that way.\u201d Gauguin to Ambroise Vollard, Jan. 1900, reprinted in John Rewald, \u201cPaul Gauguin\u2014Letters to Ambroise Vollard and Andr\u00e9 Fontainas,\u201d in Rewald, Studies in Post-Impressionism (Abrams, 1986), p. 190. See also Richard R. Brettell, \u201cSuite of Late Woodcuts, 1898\u20131899,\u201d in Richard R. Brettell, Fran\u00e7oise Cachin, Claire Fr\u00e8ches-Thory, and Charles F. Stuckey, The Art of Paul Gauguin, with assistance from Peter Zegers, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C./Art Institute of Chicago/New York Graphic Society Books, 1988), pp. 428\u201336.\n\nExamination of the printed contours in this and other prints indicates that Gauguin likely cut down thicker pieces of wood into thinner pieces, and it is in this manner that he used them twice. See also cats. 93 and 94, 96 and 97, 100 and 101, and 102 and 103 for paired examples of extant wood blocks that originally formed one thicker block.\n\n\u201cJe vous envoie une petite s\u00e9rie de gravures sur bois. . . . Faites sur des planches quelconques et avec des yeux de plus en plus mauvais, ces gravures sortent forc\u00e9ment du sale m\u00e9tier ordinaire et sont tr\u00e8s imparfaites, mais elles sont je crois int\u00e9ressantes comme Art\u201d (I am sending you a small series of wood engravings. . . . Made on some wood planks, and with my failing eyesight, these engravings are necessarily produced by a dirty, commonplace trade and are very imperfect, but I believe they are an interesting art form).

Stauffer (Galerie Kornfeld, 1988), p. 214, cat. 55. The Art Institute\u2019s impression is erroneously described as \u201cprinted in ochre on thin Japan paper.\u201d\n\nGauguin also printed a large number of second-state impressions directly over first-state impressions, although here the prints have a less ethereal quality. See for example an impression in the collection of the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris.\n\nIn the past this led to the misidentification of a thin Japanese-paper primary-support layer as found in other prints from the suite as recorded in the conservation files. Close examination under magnification confirms the presence of only one paper layer, which has a homogeneous fiber distribution and even surface texture identical on both recto and verso.\n\nDouglas W.
