Harding Collection, 1992.654\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse initially made the model of Woman Leaning on Her Hands in a soft material, either in clay or possibly a commercial material such as Plasticine. A two-part plaster mold would have been made from the model, often by a professional mold maker. The model would almost certainly have been damaged or destroyed when the mold was removed. From this waste mold a plaster of the sculpture was then cast, which, in turn, was then used to make a carefully created piece mold or a flexible gelatin mold. From one of the plaster versions yet another mold would have been made, in this case, a gelatin mold for lost-wax casting. The bronze edition of Woman Leaning on Her Hands likely was cast by the C. Valsuani foundry. X-rays of the work show evidence of the casting. The sculpture has a dark-brown patina.\n\nIncised: HM 9/10 (on bottom of proper right foot) (fig. 9.1).\n\nBronze (an alloy of primarily copper and tin). A sample was taken for ICP-OES analysis (fig. 9.2).\n\nLost-wax cast.\n\nLikely C. Valsuani foundry.\n\nVery dark brown.\n\nThere is plentiful white core material, having a granular texture, that is burned to black in a layer adjacent to the metal (fig. 9.3). Two core pins are visible in the underside. One is a rusty stub of iron wire in the proper left hand; the other is a long, gray nonmagnetic wire in the proper right lower leg. X-rays of the object (fig. 9.4) reveal a few circular plugs, which were added at the foundry to repair casting flaws. A core pin in the proper left hand extends up much of the arm; an additional higher density element runs alongside it, with a larger diameter but a trailing upper end (possibly a remnant of an armature).\n\nThere is no record of treatment at the Art Institute.\n\nThe patina is slightly lighter on high areas, which may be evidence of mild wear. At some point, likely after leaving the foundry, two threaded mounting holes were drilled into the underside, one in the proper left hand and one in the proper left foot/ankle (fig. 9.5).  \nSuzanne R.
