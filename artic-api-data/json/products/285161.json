    "description": "<p>In the period of radical change that was 1963\u201383, young black artists at the beginning of their careers confronted difficult questions about art, politics and racial identity. How to make art that would stand as innovative, original, formally and materially complex, while also making work that reflected their concerns and experience as black Americans? Soul of a Nation surveys this crucial period in American art history, bringing to light previously neglected histories of 20th-century black artists, including Sam Gilliam, Melvin Edwards, Jack Whitten, William T. Williams, Howardina Pindell, Romare Bearden, David Hammons, Barkley L. Hendricks, Senga Nengudi, Noah Purifoy, Faith Ringgold, Betye Saar, Charles White and Frank Bowling.<br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p><ul><li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li><li><strong>Dimensions:</strong>&nbsp;8.5 x 10 in.</li><li><strong>Pages:</strong> 256</li><li><strong>Illustrations:&nbsp;</strong>203 color / 33 bw.</li></ul>",
