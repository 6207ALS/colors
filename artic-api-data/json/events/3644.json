Join educators Paulina Lopez and Sam Anderson-Ramos in the exhibition, <a href=\"/exhibition/mounira-al-solh-i-strongly-believe-our-right-be-frivolous\"><em>Mounira Al Solh: I strongly believe in our right to be frivolous</em></a>, for a participatory conversation that grapples with notions of foreignness, place, compassion, and home.</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/calendar?keyword=Intersections\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an e-mail to access@artic.edu as far in advance as possible. </p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/access\">Accessibility page</a> for more information. </p>",
