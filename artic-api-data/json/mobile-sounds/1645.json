    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: This disturbing glimpse of destruction is by the artist Vija Celmins, whose family was forced to flee their native Latvia during World War II.  Celmins's painting depicts an attack on an aircraft carrier in extraordinary detail.  Like many of her works from the period, it is a meticulous re-presentation of a photograph from the artist's collection of images of war and disaster.  Here is Celmins talking about her approach to her work:</p>\n<p>VIJA CELMINS:  I started painting clippings that I had been collecting not from the photo but of the photo, which is a little bit of a difference.  I think that the war, World War II, in which I was a child and about which I knew nothing-- believe me-- I was thinking as I was trying to find something that was maybe more mine, like your own car that you can drive, your own understanding of things.  I went back to images that are kind of remembered images, and I got so seduced by the grays.  In the back of my mind I was thinking that I had a sort of a somberness in my work, very un-Southern-California-like.  They didn't know what to make of me.</p>\n",
