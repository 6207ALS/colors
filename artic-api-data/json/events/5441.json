We highlight artworks by looking closely, sharing information, and finding fresh interpretations, even of objects we may have seen many times before. Highlights tours are an opportunity to focus our attention on outstanding works of art that inspire meaningful discussion.<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-46f2276c-7fff-33dd-10b1-7d26daf0b83f\" class=\"ql-anchor\"><br><br></span><strong>What happens on a participatory tour?</strong><br>In addition to providing thought-provoking stories and information about works of art, our educators will make space for you to share your ideas throughout the tour as a means of tapping into the collective wisdom of our community. They will ask questions and prompt a variety of interactive responses so that we can have a rich discussion informed by research, observation, and lived experience. We learn more when we do it together.</p><p><strong>Who leads highlights tours?</strong><br>Highlights tours are led by Art Institute educators\u2014members of staff and the museum community who are deeply knowledgeable about art, creative practice, and the collection. They are dynamic presenters trained to connect people with art in ways that are fun, challenging, accessible, and relevant to our everyday lives. Educators design their own conversations so that each tour is unique and enriched by the interests of the facilitator and our visitors. They also really love talking about art.</p>",
