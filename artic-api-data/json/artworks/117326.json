    "description": "<p>Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Joseph Delaney received relatively little recognition for his art during his lifetime; he was eclipsed in part by the reputation of his more flamboyant brother, Beaufort. Like many African American artists of his generation, he was often overlooked for exhibitions in major museums and galleries. Sketching forceful portraits such as this one of fellow artist Jacob Lawrence, Delaney showed his work outdoors in New York\u2019s Washington Square for almost 50 years. He returned to Knoxville in 1986, holding the position of artist-in-residence at the University of Tennessee until his death in 1991.</p>\n",
