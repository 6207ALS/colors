    "copy": " In 1994, the Art Institute established a committee composed of African American community leaders whose mission was to promote and sustain racial diversity within the institution by increasing participation of African Americans in the museum. Launched with a grant from the Lila Wallace Reader\u2019s Digest Fund, the initiative continues today as the Leadership Advisory Committee (LAC). The Leadership Advisory Committee of the Art Institute provides counsel, fresh perspectives, and support to the museum on all matters related to the engagement and advancement of African Americans in the life of the institution. The Art Institute embraces the LAC\u2019s core belief: that diversity in collections, exhibitions, programming, staffing, and audience is critical to the future and well-being of all American cultural institutions. The LAC is committed to engaging the broadest and most diverse audience in pursuit of this vision by advising and supporting the museum\u2019s learning and public engagement efforts. Membership to the Leadership Advisory Committee is by invitation only. ",
