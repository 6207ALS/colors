    "description": "<p>During World War II Charles and Ray Eames designed this lightweight and inexpensive splint for the U.S. Navy. Due to the functional design and sturdy lightweight construction, these leg splints were ideal for transport to the field for injured soldiers. When commissioned to develop these splints, the Eames had already been experimenting with molded plywood technology for projects in their studio. With access to military technology and manufacturing facilities, the designers were able to further develop and refine the process in order to create their first mass-produced product. By 1945 150,000 of these iconic leg splints had been produced. The leg splint is a precursor for much of the Eameses\u2019 later work, in which they utilized similar technology to develop sculptural molded plywood furniture.</p>\n",
