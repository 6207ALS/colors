    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR:  Rising up on its back hooves this powerful horse is controlled by its rider with a dramatic upward flick of the reigns. Notice how the rider\u2019s figure rendered in cool silver is set off against the warm toned gilding of the horse\u2019s body. This juxtaposition is especially dynamic in areas like the horse\u2019s wild mane flowing against the muscular lines of his rider\u2019s arm. This tour de force of the silversmith\u2019s art was made in Southern Germany. It\u2019s theme of horse and rider was a popular and illustrious one recalling ancient Greek and Roman imagery. We can imagine the horse and rider displayed on a multi-tiered sideboard with other precious items at a grand banquet. It might also have served as a ceremonial drinking cup. Look closely at the horse\u2019s neck. There was a line running around it. The head could be lifted off and turned upside down to form a cup. At a banquet the cup could be filled with wine for each desk to drink from in turn. The horse and rider, made in the early seventeenth century, is one of the last examples in the German tradition of ceremonial drinking vessels designed in the form of heraldic mythological and other animals.</p>\n",
