Tapestry weaving is slow and therefore expensive, which made such textiles inaccessible to most consumers.</p>\n<p>The hanging of Pomona, the goddess of orchards and gardens, was paired with another tapestry depicting Flora, the goddess of flowering plants. The first version of this pair was woven in the mid-1880s with a bold background of large leaves designed by William Morris. Smaller versions were later produced with the millefleurs design in the background by John Henry Dearle. The floral background resulted in a more harmonious composition, as Dearle\u2019s smaller flowers were better suited to the delicate rendering of the goddesses.</p>\n",
