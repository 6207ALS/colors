    "description": "<p>Art Insights provides a historical and enlightening art-enrichment experience for older members of the&nbsp;community who may be unable to visit the Art Institute in person. The Art Institute is pleased to partner with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.matherlifeways.com/neighborhood-programs/telephone-topics\" target=\"_blank\">Mather&nbsp;LifeWays Telephone Topics</a>&nbsp;to provide telephone-based Art Insights conversations on a national scale. A&nbsp;telephone is required to participate in this program.</p><p>It&nbsp;has been written that \"art is continually haunted by the&nbsp;animal.\" Artists across time have represented the wild kingdom and our familiar companions in sport, leisure,&nbsp;labor, play, and prowl.&nbsp;Art Institute of Chicago volunteer lecturer Laura Davis leads a lively conversation about depictions and interpretations of animals in art.</p><p>This telephone presentation is hosted by Mather Lifeways, a nondenominational, not-for-profit organization&nbsp;dedicated to serving older adults. For more information or to register, please call (888) 600-2560 or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:teltopics@matherlifeways.com\">teltopics@matherlifeways.com</a>.</p><p>This program is available via telephone only and is not offered on-site.
