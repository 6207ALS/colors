Having purchased ten end-grain boxwood blocks of the highest quality, suitable for both wood engraving with a needle and wood carving with variously shaped gouges and knives, the artist printed all ten blocks as a group at two distinct moments in the block-carving process. He did so in a series of working campaigns, in which he would print the blocks, then revise them, then print them again. Different methods and materials were used in each campaign. These include applications of transparent watercolor washed over printed images; site-specific transfer of opaque, resinous, and waxy media from sheets of glass onto the paper before printing; and multiple, deliberately off-register printings in various inks on single sheets of paper. Close examination of a large number of examples has led to a chronology of production that chronicles the artist\u2019s more rudimentary printing methods as well as his unconventional printing techniques in which atypical materials were used at different moments in the evolution of the suite.\n\nGauguin\u2019s ingenuity is nowhere better represented than in the group of prints that he produced by combining traditional wood-block printing methods with complex media-transfer techniques, as in this third\u2014and final\u2014state impression of Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude). The group spans the entire Noa Noa Suite, with representative impressions printed with the same combination of materials and techniques from each of the ten blocks. After satisfactorily arriving at final compositions on the blocks, the artist ceased carving and focused his efforts on printing multilayered applications of color using oil-based media, some that contained beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin) in one layer, colored printing inks in another, and black and colored inks in one or more printings of the block on top of them.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 55.3.2).\n\nFour different layers of media are present in this print. Chrome yellow printing ink was applied first by means of transfer from a piece of glass. The printing ink used for this layer has a rather fluid appearance, and its application is site specific. The second layer is oil-based media that combine chrome yellow, vermilion, emerald green, and orange (a mixture of vermilion and chrome yellow or chrome orange) (see fig. 55.3.3). It too was applied to specific areas by means of transfer from the glass. However, this layer of media has a thick, cakey appearance indicative of the wax and resin it contains. Atop these two layers of colored media, the block was printed twice, first in an iron oxide\u2013containing printing ink that is likely yellow ocher, then in black printing ink that is likely carbon black.\n\nThe paper on which this impression is printed is of Western origin. It is a rather poor-quality, machine-made paper that has become slightly brittle over time. The margins are quite large on three sides and much smaller on the bottom. The paper was irregularly cut on the top and bottom and left side. The right side remained uncut. When viewed in transmitted light the paper fibers appear evenly distributed and homogeneous with no noticeable inclusions. Gauguin used printing ink and oil media in this impression and manipulated their consistencies with solvent. As a result, where oil migrated into the paper and where solvent was used, the paper fluoresces orange under ultraviolet light; two tones of orange fluorescence are especially noticeable on the verso of the sheet (see fig. 55.3.1).\n\n204 \u00d7 356 mm (image); 264 \u00d7 502 mm (sheet)\n\nThe progression of media application in this impression of Maruru is very similar to that found in impressions of Noa Noa (Fragrant) (cat. 51.3) and Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57.1) also in the collection of the Art Institute, although here Gauguin dilutes the various media with solvent and oil to obtain subtle tonal and textural variations within the composition. The media were applied in several layers. The first layer of media applied to the paper was chrome yellow. It was applied overall by means of transfer from a tone block to establish the base tone. This source could have been another piece of paper, or another wood block, but it is likely that Gauguin used a piece of glass for this purpose. The medium appears to have been applied in a semifluid consistency. Its even appearance and uniform dispersion onto the sheet and into the paper fibers, as well as the absence of any secondary paper texture, point to the use of a solid support for transfer. Using glass the artist could achieve site specificity: by placing the glass over the block he could accurately locate where he wanted to deposit media. The individual rounded areas of media in the background are quite small, while in the bottom third of the sheet similar islands of media are larger; the oil media are thicker and have more body. Coarser particles of yellow, mixed with much lesser amounts of red in a greater concentration of the oil media, are dispersed in and around the vertical and horizontal striations that make up the landscape (fig. 55.3.4). The distribution of the fine yellow medium in the background contrasts with the dispersion of the coarse medium in the foreground landscape and again points to Gauguin\u2019s deliberate application of his media to specific areas. He manipulated the consistency rather than the tone of the medium to achieve modulations within the composition. To achieve this degree of specificity it is likely that Gauguin did not ink up a wood block for this purpose. Instead, to assure that the yellow medium was accurately placed where intended, it is again likely that a piece of glass was used so that he could see where he wished to place the ink. By positioning the glass over the block, Gauguin could accurately locate the yellow in the areas in which he wanted it to appear.\n\nAfter the sheet of glass, acting as a tone block, was printed, a second layer of media was applied. Microscopic examination indicates that residual yellow ink that did not transfer to the paper remained on the glass, and a second layer of media was applied directly on top of it in anticipation of a second transfer. In this second layer of media, orange, red, and green appear and have a crusty, lichen-like appearance that differs greatly from the fluid, golden-yellow ocher printing ink that covered it. The dimensionality of the medium in the second layer is more pronounced in raking light. Examination under magnification and gentle probing with a needle reveals that the medium has a waxy consistency, and indeed, the oil-based medium was found to contain beeswax and conifer resin (probably pine resin). These rounded islands of media are dimensional, thick, and cakey and sit on top of the paper fibers. The high points of larger islands have been rubbed flat and exhibit sheen; in raking light their edges reflect light and shimmer; both are results of the transfer process.\n\nIt is possible that Gauguin took advantage of the properties of the wax-and-resin-containing medium by applying it to the glass while warm and then allowing it to cool and partially harden before transferring it to paper. When Gauguin placed the sheet of paper that now carried the yellow tone back on top of the glass and rubbed it, he transferred seemingly random dispersions of islands of encrusted media throughout the sheet. However, careful examination reveals that color variations in this layer of media are also applied site specifically. For instance, there is a greater concentration of green in the upper part of the tree behind the idol (fig. 55.3.5) that is complemented with touches of red (fig. 55.3.6) and a greater concentration of orange in the left and right lobes of the tree at either side of the idol. Yellow is dispersed among the green and orange. Within the entire form of the idol there is a fine dispersion of red media that has been greatly obscured by the ocher and black inks printed over it. This transferred layer is clearly contained within the outline of the form. Two open kapok seeds in the foreground to the left of center are toned with lesser amounts of yellow, and within the centers of the small islands of yellow, particles of green are visible under magnification. The third kapok seed to the right of center most clearly exemplifies the intentional transfer of red into a specific area, here with the aid of a stencil (fig. 55.3.7).\n\nWith the second layer of media now on the paper, Gauguin positioned it on top of the wood block that he inked with yellow ocher printing ink. The sheet was placed slightly askew of the chrome yellow layer of media; the lack of registration is visible along the vertical edges of the print. Unsatisfied with using his printing ink in a consistency that would allow it to sit on the high points of the wood block, he instead greatly diluted its consistency with oil (likely linseed oil), so much so that using a soft roller and some pressure he deposited the more viscous ink well into the deeply gouged areas of the block (fig. 55.3.8). The ocher ink appears thinner and much more fluid on the paper, and it settled around the islands of transferred media more than it sat on top of them. Under magnification slight haloing around the oil-laden ink is resultant of oil leaching from these inked passages into adjacent paper fibers. Several discolored, oxidized passages visible behind the idol and at the base of the monument point to some solvent use (fig. 55.3.9). The oxidized forms cannot be clearly correlated to a specific pigment or passage of transferred media, but it has been well established that Gauguin used solvent in combination with his oil medium in a number of impressions in this series (see, for example, L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 [The Universe Is Being Created] [cat. 54.3]). Under ultraviolet light these areas fluoresce bright orange.\n\nGauguin\u2019s final printing of the block in black was the most straightforward step in his process. Rather than simply inking the block and printing it, he wiped the ink from the foreground and selectively through the middle ground to establish soft nuanced transitions from black to ocher. Registration was again skewed ever so slightly (1 mm to the right) to soften the overall effect. Additionally the black ink was rolled unevenly across the block so that after printing, areas of ocher remain visible through the black (fig. 55.3.10). Ultimately, Gauguin worked in a deliberate manner to lay out zones of color, leaving only the visual end result of the mechanical transfer of the media to chance. The artist\u2019s approach was deliberate; his materials and their application were well thought-out to achieve the desired tonal and textural variations evident in the work. What at first glance appears to be a spontaneously executed production is instead a well-considered methodology borne of an assessment of the materials, their diverse mechanical properties, and their distinctive appearance when transferred onto a paper surface.\n\nIn anticipation of this publication the print underwent conservation treatment. It was dry cleaned; old hinges, paper tapes, and adhesive residues were removed. Tears were mended, and fragile edges were reinforced with Japanese paper fibers.\n\nThe print is in excellent condition. There are soft vertical undulations across the sheet. There are a series of tight creases associated with the printing in the upper right, lower right, and lower left. There is a small loss located 5 mm in from the right edge and 80 mm down from the top edge that was formed by a grazing insect who also grazed into the image to the left of this area, causing an irregular surface abrasion. There is a 10 cm horizontal, linear abrasion through the center that is barely visible in raking light.  \nHarriet K.

Embossed into the verso of each is the trade name of the manufacturer, Kiessling. The manufacturer\u2019s stamp reads: Kiessling / J Lacroix Suc / PARIS / D 089. Blocks for Maruru (Offerings of Gratitude) (cat. 55.1) and Manao tupapau (She Thinks of the Ghost or The Ghost Thinks of Her) (cat. 60.1) are in the Art Institute\u2019s collection. The block for Noa Noa (cat. 51) is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and is described as fruitwood, possibly pearwood. The blocks for Te po (The Night) (cat. 52), Auti te pape (Women at the River) (cat. 59), and Nave nave fenua (Delightful Land) (cat. 56) are in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The block for L\u2019univers est cr\u00e9\u00e9 (The Universe Is Being Created) (cat. 54) is in the Memorial Art Gallery, University of Rochester, New York. The block for Mahna no varua ino (The Devil Speaks) (cat. 57) resides in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris. Gauguin repurposed two blocks from the suite, Te atua (The God) (cat. 53) and Te faruru (Here We Make Love) (cat. 58), by cutting them down and using the backs for a series of smaller prints that he made during his last years in Paris and upon his return to Tahiti in 1895. Two of the segments from the block for Te faruru are in the N\u00e1rodn\u00ed Galerie, Prague. The segments from the block used for Te atua are presently lost.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing his insights into the Noa Noa Suite. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIt is possible that this oil-based medium, which does not resemble printing ink, came directly from the palette that Gauguin used for his paintings. He did not produce these prints in isolation from the artworks that he was producing in other media in his studio. Paintings analyzed for this publication were found to contain original wax coatings (see, for example, Te raau rahi [The Big Tree] [cat. 27]), and several publications cite Gauguin\u2019s use of wax and resin in his paint mixtures. See, for example, Carol Christensen, \u201cThe Painting Materials and Techniques of Paul Gauguin,\u201d Conservation Research, ed. Ross M. Merrill, Studies in the History of Art, Monograph Series 2, vol. 41 (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., 1993), pp. 63\u2013103.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the artwork may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. Where annotations are available, the jagged-line icon brings up a list of them, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the artwork\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, ultraviolet, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the artwork as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nThis method of transfer is clearly the precursor to the watercolor and oil transfer methods that Gauguin adopted moving forward (see, for example, cat. 68 and cat. 124). See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nPigment analysis carried out by C\u00e9line Daher is gratefully acknowledged; Daher, XRF and Raman microspectroscopy analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, on file in Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nAlthough the work was not examined using photometric stereo, conclusions drawn from using this method of examination for other prints in the series greatly informed study of this print.\n\nI am grateful to Peter Zegers for so generously sharing with me his observations about Gauguin\u2019s use of glass and for his insights into the Noa Noa Suite wood-block prints. See Peter Kort Zegers, \u201cIn the Kitchen with Paul Gauguin: Devising Recipes for a Symbolist Graphic Aesthetic,\u201d in The Broad Spectrum: Studies in Materials, Techniques, and Conservation of Color on Paper, ed. Harriet K. Stratis and Britt Salvesen (Archetype, 2002), pp. 138\u201344.\n\nIn many ways the carrier used to transfer media determines the visual qualities that are obtained once the media have been transferred onto a paper support. In this impression, because the bright-yellow medium appears to be of a semifluid consistency, it could not have been transferred from a paper carrier\u2014the paper itself would have absorbed much more media than it would have released in the transfer process, and the resulting transfer would not have been as distinct and media rich.\n\nThis technique differs from that used to add the base tone to a similar impression of Noa Noa (cat. 51.3). In the Noa Noa impression, the artist used subtractive techniques to wipe the yellow ink from the glass.\n\nThe organic media in the paint was analyzed using THM-Py-GCMS and found to be an oil-based medium, some with beeswax and Pinaceae resin present in varying amounts in different prints. C\u00e9line Daher, THM-Py-GCMS analytical results summary, Dec. 2015, Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThat Gauguin\u2019s methodology was deliberate rather than random is further illustrated by another third-state impression in the collection of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, Williamstown. It is remarkably close to the Chicago impression, and to a great degree, Gauguin applied similar, if not identical, media in a similar sequence. Site specificity of media application is comparable. The artist did, however, include a final step in the making of the Clark impression by adding touches of black and ocher by hand with a dry brush in the faces of the couple to the left. This technique is identical to that used in an impression of Noa Noa in the Art Institute\u2019s collection (see cat. 51.3).\n\nMary Cropley, condition report, Mar. 1988; Harriet K.
