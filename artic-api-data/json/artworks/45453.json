He carefully renders the intricacy of rigging, the geometry of masts, and curved hulls. Bruegel\u2019s interest in such vessels belonged to a wider fascination among Antwerp citizens with the shipping trade and naval power that had become so central to the city\u2019s booming economy. Residents of this maritime hub took great pride in the engineering of its ships and the expertise of its sailors and navigators.</p>\n",
