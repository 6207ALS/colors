With these canvases, the artist launched his 1920s series of odalisques, which present costumed women relaxing in ornately decorated interior settings. As he pivoted in subject matter, Matisse described his aims in a letter to his wife, Am\u00e9lie, in January 1921. He wrote, \u201cI\u2019m searching for the density of things\u2014instead of reducing what I see to a silhouette, I\u2019m trying to convey volume and modeling.\u201d In Woman on a Rose Divan, made quickly on a pre-primed canvas with no preliminary sketching, and in related studies, the artist explored interests that would come to dominate his paintings throughout the decade. In these works, Matisse experimented with evoking volume within a compressed pictorial space, renewed his fascination with North African textiles and themes, and delicately balanced line and modeling with color and light.\n\nMade while the artist was staying at the H\u00f4tel de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e in Nice, the swift execution, intimate format, and immediacy of Woman on a Rose Divan reflect Matisse\u2019s search for a new subject and a fresh approach to painting in the spring of 1921. He had long produced works in series and pairs, experimenting with different treatments of the same subject in esquisses, freely painted, preparatory sketches that did not always lead to a traditional larger tableau, a more finished painting. In Woman on a Rose Divan, the size of the canvas and close framing allowed the artist to test different methods as he quickly built up layers of wet-in-wet strokes without significantly altering the composition of the painting. In shading the red, patterned curtain, the artist played with the effects of three different types of brushstrokes. On the left, thick, black-over-brown diagonal marks flatten the contours while a fading succession of mixed black, brown, violet, and orange strokes in the center shadow more gently mold the curtain\u2019s form. On the right, long, heavy, black-over-brown vertical lines sharpen the folds before blending into the dark outline around the edge of the divan. The artist similarly divided his handling of the model\u2019s feet. While the carefully contoured shading of her bent leg defines her ankle and toes, her extended leg is handled so softly that its blurred foot seems to meld into the cushion. By visually connecting the background, body, and decor, Matisse created a fluid balance between the different pictorial elements of his painting.\n\nLike many of Matisse\u2019s odalisque paintings, Woman on a Rose Divan demonstrates the artist\u2019s skill in evoking illusionistic depth and volume while drawing attention to the surface of the canvas. Despite sharp, reinforced black contours that accentuate the folds of the model\u2019s burnoose, the thick dabs of yellow-tinged gold stripes sit on top of the picture plane. The artist surrounded the figure with swatches of patterns that similarly denote depth and flatten the pictorial space between the green wall on the left, the red curtain, and the crosshatched floor. He built up the floral pattern by blocking the design in white over a transparent underlayer of orange before filling in the negative space with red tones and adding the green-and-white decoration. The successive application of brushstrokes in the patterns pushes the compressed composition to the surface. Like Woman on a Rose Divan, a closely related group of small-scale studies that includes Woman Reclining (April\u2013May 1921; fig. 33.3) present condensed views of languid models bathed in a bright light that sharpens both the depth of the space and the flatness of the patterned textiles. These works fueled Matisse\u2019s larger experiments, as illustrated by the treatment of space, bodies, and patterns in Odalisque with Red Pants (fall 1921; fig. 33.4).\n\nWhile Woman on a Rose Divan anticipated the innovations seen in Matisse\u2019s odalisques, it also exemplified his renewed interest in North African themes that had inspired his visual experiments with pictorial space, line, and color earlier in his career. Matisse visited Morocco twice in 1912 and 1913, which had a significant impact on his painting. In Woman on a Rose Divan, the model\u2019s sizable costume of a burnoose and gold-trimmed red pants visually centers her figure within the patterned backdrop. After making the Art Institute\u2019s canvas, Matisse\u2019s interest in exotic textiles and staging grew in importance. Studio photographs from the time reveal the carefully constructed environments he made for his paintings. In one picture with his model (fig. 33.5) and another with the artist Pierre Bonnard (fig. 33.6), we see an elaborate set with a wooden frame used to suspend patterned fabrics, a table adorned with objects, and a daybed covered with decorative textiles, revealing the significance that staging had taken in his pictorial investigations.\n\nAs Matisse started his series of odalisques, he experimented with the use of direct sunlight to structure his compositions. In retrospect, he identified that \u201cin this ambience of languid relaxation, beneath the sun-drenched torpor that bathes things and people . . . a specifically pictorial tension . . . arises from the interplay and mutual relations of the various elements.\u201d In Woman on a Rose Divan, Matisse shifted away from the subject of his early Nice works that depict women in furnished rooms with filtered light from curtained windows framing views onto a waterfront promenade, such as Interior at Nice (1919 or 1920; cat. 30). Instead, the bright light from the upper left corner of the canvas illuminates the top of the model\u2019s burnoose and anchors the pictorial space. Matisse left traces of his minor color adjustments on the left wall and the white shutters where layers of turquoise and blue tones were covered with a pale green and white to brighten the composition. The play between light, shadow, volumetric depth, and abstract flatness in Woman on a Rose Divan helped set the course for the artist\u2019s grander and more complex odalisque statements in the years to come.  \nMarin Sarv\u00e9-Tarr\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Henri Matisse\u2019s Woman on a Rose Divan was painted on a pre-primed, twill weave linen canvas, stretched onto a no. 8 portrait (figure) standard-size (46 \u00d7 38 cm) canvas, turned horizontally. The twill weave imparts a strong diagonal texture that breaks up the brushwork. There is no clear evidence of an underdrawing or painted sketch. During the painting process, Matisse focused on color and detail within this small composition, in which most of the delineated forms are massed in the upper left quadrant, with the legs extending out like spokes. Most surfaces in the picture are heavily patterned, with the unadorned rose divan as a noticeable exception. Virtually every area is built up in layers, with wet-in-wet mixing of the overlapping strokes. Though no significant changes were made to the composition, many areas of color were adjusted in the layering. Originally there was more blue and blue-green in the otherwise hot-hued palette with pale blue-green and pink tones in the burnoose wrapped around the figure, pale blue-green for the wallpaper, and shutter door, and pale blue curtains at upper left. These tones were later subdued with whites and yellows. The painting is in excellent, nearly pristine condition. It is unlined and as originally stretched, likely by Matisse, and it appears to have the original coating.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 33.7).\n\nSigned: Henri-Matisse (lower right, in brown paint) (fig. 33.8 and fig. 33.9).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nThe dimensions correspond to a no. 8 portrait (figure) standard-size stretcher (46 \u00d7 38 cm), turned horizontally.\n\nMedium-weight, two over one twill weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 14.3V (0.4) \u00d716.2H (0.6) threads/cm (fig. 33.10 and fig. 33.11). The vertical threads correspond to the doubled warp and the horizontal threads to the single weft (fig. 33.12).\n\nThe twill canvas imparts its own diagonal pattern on this highly patterned paint surface. Perhaps the use of twill was an intentional decision to break up the brushwork, as the paint catches in the diagonal grooves of the twill, lending a looser quality to the small-scaled brushwork (fig. 33.13).\n\nAround this same time Matisse worked on a number of works on twill canvas, including an even smaller twill canvas (close to a no. 6 figure [41 \u00d7 33 cm] format) with a similarly pronounced weave (fig. 33.14). There is faint evidence of cusping from the attachment of the canvas to the stretcher.\n\nCurrent stretching: Dates to the original stretching, presumably by the artist. Width of tacking margins: bottom, 2 cm; right, top, and left, 2.5 cm.\n\nCurrent stretcher: The current stretcher is original to the painting. It consists of five members, with bevels front and reverse and knotholes in the wood (fig. 33.15). The stretcher bars are 4 cm wide and 1.5 cm thick.\n\nNone observed in current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nCross-sectional analysis revealed a thin tan-colored organic sizing layer under the ground (probably glue). In ultraviolet light, this layer has a light-blue fluorescence (fig. 33.16).\n\nPre-primed. Very fine curving, diagonal brush marks or wiping marks from ground application are visible in the X-ray (fig. 33.17). The ground extends onto all four tacking margins. Cross-sectional analysis revealed that the ground consists of a single layer that ranges from about 9 to 80 \u03bcm in thickness (fig. 33.18).\n\nWhite (fig. 33.19). There are trace amounts of dark brownish-black pigment particles in the ground.\n\nFTIR analysis determined that the ground is composed of lead white (basic and neutral lead carbonates) in an oil medium. SEM/EDX analysis disclosed a mixture of mostly lead white with traces of calcium carbonate and barium sulfate.\n\nLittle of an underdrawing or preliminary sketch is visible under the paint. Most of the lines visible in transmitted infrared are not underdrawing, but are actually raised edges of paint strokes, such as the lines seen within the figure\u2019s face (fig. 33.20). However, there may be underdrawn lines at the front of the figure\u2019s hair and the top of the burnoose over her head, where they are not followed exactly in the paint layers.\n\nIn transmitted infrared there appears to be a vertical pencil line under the paint that runs from top to bottom through the model\u2019s thigh (fig. 33.21). The line divides the composition into three fifths and two fifths. The line may not relate to the present composition, although it could signify a line dividing the more crowded left side, and the sparser right side of the composition that Matisse intended to paint.\n\nThe vertical line dividing the width of the canvas, due to its thin, even quality, appears to be graphite. The other lines of possible underdrawing are likely graphite too, since charcoal particles have not been picked up by the paint layers.\n\nNone apparent.\n\nThe picture was painted quickly but not directly. Virtually every area is built up in layers, with wet-in-wet mixing of the overlapping strokes and layers (fig. 33.22 and fig. 33.23). Though no significant compositional changes were made, many areas of color were adjusted in the layering.\n\nThe shape of the yellow-striped burnoose was initially more softly defined, with pale-pink, pale-blue-green, and gray shading (fig. 33.24 and fig. 33.25). The forms shifted somewhat and became more definite as the yellow stripes and white paint daubs between them were added, and then again as the black contour lines and gray shadows were superimposed, slightly changing the width of the folds (fig. 33.26 and fig. 33.27). The thick, bright touches of white, painted over the slightly muddy mixtures of gray, pink, and blue-green beneath, give the burnoose greater substance; the pattern of these white strokes is much more apparent on the X-ray (fig. 33.28). The small yellow stripes were painted in a two-step process: deeper gold overlaid with a paler highlight. Later, Matisse defined the back edge of the burnoose framing the figure\u2019s head with small blue-green touches.\n\nThere is evidence that the color of the wallpaper, which now appears pale green, was first a stronger turquoise (fig. 33.29 and fig. 33.30). Matisse changed the wallpaper to a pale blue-green and then laid a subtle yellow-green toning on top (fig. 33.31). It is heavier on the left side of the wallpaper, perhaps to distinguish it from the adjacent white curtain, while at the other edge the wallpaper is paler, and contrasts well with the dark red curtain. The white curtain on the left was initially pale blue with muddy green shadows for the inner folds (fig. 33.32 and fig. 33.33). Matisse then tried painting these shadows brown, before settling on black. The shutter on the left edge was first painted turquoise but was then covered with pale yellow\u2014the tones mixing wet-in-wet to create a pale greenish cast, similar to the color of the wallpaper (fig. 33.34). The lace antimacassar covering the back of the divan was a later addition, painted over the dilute violet used to lay in the divan. The spotted antimacassar was extended over the blue of the curtain and blue-green of the wallpaper, widening the back of the divan (fig. 33.35). A pale tan was then applied as a base color, followed by the black-and-white pattern. A violet lay-in is visible under the red-striped pillow. This pillow was first shaded at the edge with dark blue, but this was painted out by a thick, matte violet shadow, which may have lightened over time due to sinking in of the paint medium.\n\nMatisse may have made adjustments to the figure\u2019s head after painting one initial black stroke that indicated the hair on the upper left side of the face. It appears that originally there was a larger pink expanse for the forehead and a possible ear. He then painted over the forehead with more dark strokes of hair and added a black wave over the finished burnoose (see fig. 33.20 and fig. 33.21). He painted sultry, heavy-lidded, dark-brown eyes over the earlier gray indication of facial features, and contoured the chin while shading the neck with a brown that was used in the wallpaper design nearby.\n\nThe painting has a heavily patterned surface and is full of decorative detail and varied brushwork. The brushwork is not tight; this is the result of Matisse\u2019s loose handling, the twill canvas texture that breaks up the brushwork, the wet-in-wet mixing, and the superimposed layering that tends to blur hard edges. Within the rich decor, the rose divan occupies a large central space empty of patterning. Matisse\u2019s method of painting the divan gives the effect of it being a single rich color because the overlaid thin coats of red and violet are almost the same tone. The longer horizontal strokes that Matisse used on the divan, perhaps created with a dry brush after the paint was applied, also contribute to the more placid stretch of the divan (fig. 33.36). The figure stands out against the seat like a sculptural assemblage, balanced on a vertical leg, and counterbalanced by the leg extended out in one direction and the elbow extending in the opposite direction (see fig. 33.37).\n\nThe red curtain in the right background was intricately layered. Matisse first applied a transparent orange layer, then blocked in the design elements with pale green and filled in the negative spaces around them on the orange layer with transparent, glaze-like strokes of purple-red and reddish brown. Dark-green and light-green strokes (as well as yellow in one row) were added to the design (fig. 33.38). Although this was generally how the curtain evolved, Matisse was not systematic and jumped back and forth as his focus shifted, so that he added some new elements at the very end and repeated parts of the procedure. All these layers seem to have been applied wet-in-wet, which led to much mixing of colors: for example, a stroke of pale green mixed with the underlying orange created pale-orange as well as muddier hues. Less mixing occured when the stroke was lightly dabbed\u2014as when the brush loaded with purple-red was simply set down in place and lifted\u2014leaving the imprint of the brush like a fingerprint (fig. 33.39).\n\nTypically Matisse eschewed too methodical a system in his painting process in favor of experimentation. This is reflected in Matisse\u2019s painting of the red curtain: each of the three dark folds in the fabric were created differently (fig. 33.40). The right shadow does not appear to have an orange lay-in. Abandoning the short diagonals of the left shadow and paler middle fold shadow (painted with a less loaded brush), Matisse painted long vertical strokes, first with dark brown, then with black.The difference between this and the diagonally painted shadows is that the latter are softer and seem to recede behind the divan, while the hard-edged vertical strokes push forward to the side of the divan. The curtain\u2019s design is most carefully delineated on the left side, Moving toward the right, the design and strokes are simplified both in color and form, until at the right edge of the canvas they run together in a vertical flow. Similarly, the vertically applied black shadow reiterates the boundary of the painting\u2019s right edge. It follows along the edge of the divan like a drip running down along an actual raised edge (see fig. 33.37).\n\nReinforcing the contours was a constant part of the painting process. For example, on the extended leg, after the first thin layer of color, the initial violet layer of the rose divan was painted around it, and then the edge of the leg was reinforced with a transparent brown line (fig. 33.41). Later came darker layers for the rose divan, and the contours of the leg were reinforced with intermittent dark lines. Still later, more opaque differentiated colors were applied to the leg, which then required further contour redefinition.\n\nBrushes, mostly 0.5 cm width; wider brushes in the divan and other areas, approximately 0.75 cm (based on width of brushstrokes). Daubs with pressure grow larger.\n\nLimited sampling from the pinkish drapery identified pale and deeper red lake, reddish-orange particles that are possibly burnt sienna, bone black, and traces of cobalt violet.\n\nThe palette of mostly warm, saturated hues is counterbalanced by the black-and-white contrast of the burnoose, antimacassar, and white curtain and the cooler blue of the pillow and the pale green of the wallpaper and shutter at upper left. The modality of the painting is deepened by the dark shadows, pillows, hair, dark contour lines, and heavy cross-hatching on the carpet. The lights have a worn rather than fresh feel, for they are not clear whites, but mixed with other colors or affected by layers above or below them.\n\nAlmost everything is layered with a secondary hue\u2014even the carpet, where the cross-hatched grid was first laid down with rose-violet, then reinforced with a darker mixture of reddish brown, a dark shade repeated in the signature (fig. 33.42).\n\nOil (estimated). The thin layers of paint appear glossy and medium-rich, probably with extra medium added by Matisse.\n\nIn 2008, a synthetic varnish was removed, leaving the artist\u2019s original coating intact. The paint surface is relatively glossy. Sinking in of the original varnish is observed in isolated areas of matte paint, such as the violet decoration on the blue pillow.\n\nIn 1964 grime was removed with solvent, followed by a spray coat of polyvinyl acetate (PVA) AYAA varnish.\n\nIn 2008 the synthetic varnish was removed, a tear was mended, and a few minor spots were inpainted.\n\nThe painting is in excellent condition. It is unlined and on its original stretcher. Aside from Matisse\u2019s original overall coating, the surface has remained unvarnished except for a synthetic spray coating applied in 1964, which was removed in 2008. There are almost no losses or retouching.  \nKristin Hoermann Lister, with contributions by Inge Fiedler\n\nCurrent frame (installation date unknown): The work is framed in an early twentieth-century, French, Louis XIV reproduction, ogee frame with a fleur-de-lis cartouche at each corner and center connected by foliate c-scrolls. The frame has both water gilding and oil gilding on red bole over gesso and cast-plaster ornament. The gilding is heavily distressed and overpainted with a gray decape finish. The frame is mitered and nailed, with a back frame glued in place. The interior and back of the frame is overpainted. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ogee; fillet; scotia side; ogee face with cast-plaster fleur-de-lis-corner-and-center cartouches connected by foliate c-scrolls on a quadrillage bed; fillet; sanded frieze; fillet; and ogee sight edge with a running c-scroll bellflower ornament (fig. 33.43).\n\nPrevious frame: The work was previously housed in an American, unadorned, white-painted, molding frame. In 1926 the entire Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection was framed in white painted frames with either a plain square face profile or a torus-shaped molding and both with a fillet and cove sight edge (fig. 33.44).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Sold by the artist to Bernheim-Jeune, Paris, Apr. 19, 1921\u2013June 25, 1923.\n\nSold to Frederick Clay Bartlett (1873\u20131953), Chicago, June 25, 1923\u2013Jan. 27, 1926.\n\nGiven to the Art Institute of Chicago, Jan. 27, 1926.\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section exhibitions\" id=\"exhibitions\">Art Institute of Chicago, Group of Modern Paintings from the Birch-Bartlett Collection, Sept. 8\u2013Oct. 22, 1923, no cat.\n\nArt Institute of Chicago, Birch-Bartlett Collection of Modern European Paintings, Sept. 3\u2013Oct. 22, 1924, no cat.\n\nMinneapolis Institute of Arts, Exhibition of Modern French Paintings from the Birch-Bartlett Collection Lent by Frederick C.

According to the catalogue, Matisse sold thirteen works to Galerie Bernheim-Jeune on April 19, 1921. These included La terrasse\u2014Nice (1921; no. 446) and other depictions of women in modern dress in interiors or on balconies, often with windows through which the sea or the waterfront promenade can be seen. These subjects were common during his Nice period. Like Woman on a Rose Divan, the 1921 works Nu au fauteuil (no. 474; fig. 1), Nu (no. 475; fig. 2), and Nu au turban (no. 486; fig. 3) present closely cropped views of lounging and seated nudes draped in textiles.\n\nAs translated in Hilary Spurling, Matisse the Master: A Life of Henri Matisse; The Conquest of Colour, 1909\u20131954 (Knopf, 2005), p. 238.\n\nMany of Matisse\u2019s paintings from 1921 are on small, standard-sized canvases, which allowed him to produce a large number of works over the spring as he experimented with ideas that would inform his odalisque series. For example, six of the works sold to Galerie Bernheim-Jeuneon April 19 measured 38 \u00d7 46 cm (15 \u00d7 18 1/8 in.), the standard-size canvas Portrait #8 (Figure 8) (46 x 38 in.) rotated ninety degrees, as in the case of Woman on a Rose Divan. See Dauberville and Dauberville, Matisse, pp. 960\u20131046, for a survey of Matisse\u2019s output in the spring of 1921. See, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31.\n\nAs Stephanie D\u2019Alessandro and John Elderfield point out, Matisse\u2019s series and sequences of works adopted both \u201cthe traditional approach to related works\u2014making a loose, spontaneous esquisse (a freely painted, preparatory sketch) and a more finished tableau (a more finished painting) . . . as well as a more experimental approach, in which he treated the same subject at a different level of finish, but in different styles.\u201d D\u2019Alessandro and Elderfield, \u201cMatisse, 1913\u20131917, and the Methods of Modern Construction,\u201d in Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913\u20131917, exh. cat. (Art Institute of Chicago/Museum of Modern Art, New York/Yale University Press, 2010), p. 25. For more on this subject, see Dorthe Aagesen and Rebecca Rabinow, eds., Matisse: In Search of True Painting, exh. cat. (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 2012); and C\u00e9cile Debray, ed., Matisse: Paires et s\u00e9ries, exh. cat. (Centre Pompidou, 2012).\n\nFor more on this formative period, see National Gallery of Art, Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912\u20131913, exh. cat. (National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, 1990). In 1951 Matisse told the French artist and poet Andr\u00e9 Verdet that \u201cthe Odalisques were the fruits of a happy nostalgia, of a lovely, lively dream and of the almost ecstatic, enchanted experience of those days and nights, in the incantation of the Moroccan climate. I felt an irresistible need to express that ecstasy, that divine nonchalance, in the corresponding colored rhythms.\u201d Verdet, Entretiens notes et \u00e9crits sur la peinture: Braque, L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Picasso (Galil\u00e9e, 1978), as translated in Jack Flam, Matisse on Art, rev. ed. (University of California Press, 1995), p. 301, n. 18.\n\nThe fantasy of such orchestrated settings puts an additional emphasis on Matisse\u2019s choice of the H\u00f4tel de la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e for his work and his recollection of it as \u201cfake, absurd, amazing, delicious,\u201d quoted in Francis Carco, L\u2019ami des peintres (Gaillmard, 1953), p. 227, as translated in Spurling, Matisse the Master, p. 221. Spurling also links Matisse\u2019s approach to the odalisques to the rise of the French film industry in Nice, where many 1920s productions were shot: \u201cMatisse, like the popular cinema, positively emphasized the fact that this [sic] odalisques, with their up-to-date hair-dos and frank body language, come neither from North Africa nor the Middle East but from contemporary France.\u201d Spurling, Matisse the Master, p. 247.\n\nThe identity of the woman and the date of the photograph is in dispute. Jack Cowart identifies the model as Henriette Darricarr\u00e8re in Henri Matisse: The Early Years Nice (1987). John Elderfield identifies the woman as an unnamed model, dating the photograph around 1927\u201328 in Drawings of Henri Matisse (1984) and Henri Matisse: A Retrospective (1992).\n\nMatisse\u2019s interest in staging had grown since the summer of 1920, when he revisited themes from the work of Impressionist painters while traveling to \u00c9tretaton, on the coast of Normandy. As Alfred H. Barr, writes: \u201cThe technique and vision is . . . closer to that of [\u00c9douard] Manet in his landscape sketches and further confirms Matisse\u2019s retrospection toward the 19th century at this period.\u201d Barr, Matisse, p. 209. Woman on a Rose Divan contributes to Matisse\u2019s increased use of staged environments, which he fully adopted during the Nice period. Hilary Spurling, explains that \u201cMatisse had been collecting Oriental bits and pieces\u2014waistcoats, jackets, silk robes, rugs, lamps, trays, a little inlaid table\u2014for years from a Lebanese couple called Ibrahim, who kept a boutique on the rue Royale in Paris. He used them to improvise the kind of settings women endlessly made for themselves in Tangier from rugs, cushions, pieces of stuff and small portable tables or stools.\u201d Spurling, Matisse the Master, p. 243.\n\nVerdet, Entretiens notes et \u00e9crits, p. 125, as translated in Flam, Matisse on Art, 301, n. 18.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged-line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular-arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_Analytical\\_Report,\u201d July 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee, for example, the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeios A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. Original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. The closely related Woman Reclining (Barnes Foundation) is approximately twice as large (55.9 \u00d7 66 cm) and not a standard size.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Henri Matisse, Woman on Rose Divan (1926.219),\u201d Jan. 2015.\n\nNormally artists use finer canvases for smaller works. It is unusual to use canvas with a distinctive tooth, such as twill, on such a small work, since small works are usually viewed closely, where the weave of the canvas will be more visible, unless the paint is thick.\n\nTwill canvases are also found on other paintings from this time, including Domino Players (January\u2013April 1921) and Woman Reclining (April\u2013May 1921), both in the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Science and Conservation, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Science and Conservation, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nTraces of blackish particles were observed present in cross sections of the ground and by PLM in a dispersed sample of the lead white ground. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe ground composition was analyzed using FTIR; see Ken Sutherland, Apr. 27, 2017 report; SEM/EDX and PLM analysis conducted by Inge Fiedler; see Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 19, 2017, both on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nMatisse drew and painted many similar scenes of the model on the divan, and he may have executed this small, simple composition for the most part directly, without a sketch (see Application/technique).\n\nAt about the same time, Matisse painted a larger canvas of a similar composition of a woman reclining on a rose divan in the same area of the room, but this time she is more centered, with her legs folded up rather than extended (see fig. 33.4 in curatorial essay).\n\nThe curtain in Matisse\u2019s Woman Reclining (1921; fig. 33.4).\n\nThe orange lay-in is similar to the color of the curtain in Matisse\u2019s Woman Reclining (1921; fig. 33.4).\n\nPigments were identified by PLM. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1926\\_219\\_Matisse\\_Rose\\_Divan\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d July 19, 2017, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe binding medium was not analyzed. The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on the author\u2019s knowledge of Matisse\u2019s technique and published analyses of Matisse\u2019s paintings.\n\nThe other paintings by Matisse in the Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection that appear to have artist-applied overall varnishes are Apples (1916; cat. 24), Woman before an Aquarium (1921\u201323; cat. 34), Lemons on a Pewter Plate (1926; cat. 39), and Girl in Yellow and Blue with a Guitar (1939; cat. 46), and ones with artist-applied partial varnishes are Laurette with a Cup of Coffee (1916/17; cat. 26) and Daisies (1939; cat. 47).\n\nAlfred Jakstas, treatment report, Nov. 19, 1964, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nFaye Wrubel, treatment report, Oct. 7, 2008, on file in the Department of Conservation and Science, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe duration of this approach to framing the Helen Birch Bartlett Memorial Collection is unknown; however, by the time of the Century of Progress exhibition in 1933 (see Exhibition History), all the works appear to have been reframed.\n\nGuy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Matisse: Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune, vol. 2 (\u00c9ditions Bernheim-Jeune, 1995), p. 1018.\n\nGuy-Patrice Dauberville and Michel Dauberville, Matisse: Henri Matisse chez Bernheim-Jeune, vol. 2 (\u00c9ditions Bernheim-Jeune, 1995), p. 1018; and Board of Trustees meeting minutes, Jan. 27, 1926, pp. 1\u20132; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBoard of Trustees meeting minutes, Jan. 27, 1926, pp. I\u2013II; photocopy in curatorial object file, Department of Modern and Contemporary Art, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe exhibition catalogue lists the dates as June 1\u2013November 1, 1933, but newspaper articles confirm that the exhibition opened on May 23.
