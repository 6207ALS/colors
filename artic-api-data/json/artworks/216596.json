    "description": "<p>Cohesive layouts and modular frameworks provide the underpinning of an identity in a publication series. Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firm A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format\u2014the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.</p>\n",
