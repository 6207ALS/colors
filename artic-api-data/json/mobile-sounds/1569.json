    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: Renoir painted these two young acrobats at a popular Parisian circus in 1879. Douglas Druick, president and Eloise W. Martin director of the Art Institute of Chicago.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: The younger sister stands holding the oranges, which the appreciative audience is throwing to the girls after their performance, and the older sister is gesturing to the crowd. In fact, they look more like dancers having _______ finished performance rather than acrobats and this emphasis on the grace with which they hold themselves rather than on the contortions of their performance as acrobats is typical of the way Renoir approached his subject when making a painting. He was interested in conveying a sense of beauty and harmony in the picture.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Renoir\u2019s scene is not illuminated by the harsh gaslight that was then used in circuses--</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: Rather we see these two young girls depicted as if they are out of doors with a very gentle light, which draws attention to the golden details of their costume and their hair ribbons and their boots so that we get a chromatic harmony and great delicacy.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: Renoir\u2019s close-up view of the acrobats is that of an audience member with opera glasses, such as the well-dressed man to the upper right.</p>\n<p>DOUGLAS DRUICK: And, so, this is the type of subject, which in the late 1870s when Renoir made this represented the quintessence of modern fashionable life in Paris.&quot;</p>\n",
