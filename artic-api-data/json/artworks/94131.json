    "provenance_text": "Charlotte Labille (1889\u20131963), Paris, by Jan. 1, 1925 [According to notes in the curatorial object file, there was an inscription on the back of the old mount, in pen and blue ink, which partially reads: Le dessin a la plume de P.A. Renoir, mon frere et me representant assis lisant au bord de la mediterranee est la propriete de Charlotte Labille/ Paris, 1 janvier 1925/ Edmond Renoir.  The mount is now lost. Correspondence in the Paul Rosenberg Gallery Archive confirm that Charlotte Labille was a regular client of Rosenberg\u2019s during the 1920s.].   Paul Rosenberg (1881\u20131959), Paris and Bordeaux, by Sept. 15, 1940 [See pre\u2013World War II Paul Rosenberg Gallery, stock card number 1346 (the handwriting is nearly illegible; it could also be 8846)]; confiscated by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), Sept. 15, 1940 [ERR card PR 154]; selected by Walter Andreas Hofer (1893\u2013c. 1971) at the Jeu de Paume, Paris, for Hermann Goering (1893\u20131946) and transferred from the ERR to Goering, Dec. 2, 1941 [See ERR card PR 154. Also see the Office of Strategic Services, Art Looting Investigation Unit, Consolidated Interrogation Report, no. 2: The Goering Collection (Sept. 15, 1945), pp. 133\u201334; attachment 1; and attachment 5, p. 11, no. 144. Notes on the back of the ERR\u2019s photograph of the drawing confirm that it was no. 144 in the Goering inventory.]; exchanged by Hermann Goering, with Hans Wendland (born 1880) and Theodor Fischer (1878\u20131957), Lucerne, via Walter Andreas Hofer, early 1942 [See Office of Strategic Services, Art Looting Investigation Unit, Consolidated Interrogation Report, no. 2: The Goering Collection (Sept. 15, 1945), pp. 133\u201334. See also Records of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historical Monuments in War Areas (Roberts Commission), 1943\u201346, letter from the Commercial Secretariat of the British Legation in Berne, dated Dec. 29, 1944.]; returned to Paul Rosenberg, New York, June 3, 1948 [In a private lawsuit against Theodor Fischer, a Lucerne tribunal ruled in Rosenberg\u2019s favor on June 3, 1948, and ordered the picture returned. See Lynn H. Nichols, The Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe\u2019s Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War (Knopf, 1994), pp. 419\u201320.]; probably sold by the Rosenberg family to E. V. Thaw and Company (founded 1950), New York, c. 1977 [After its restitution, the drawing was part of the Rosenberg family private collection rather than gallery stock. As a result, the Rosenberg Gallery Archives do not have a record of the sale or transfer of this drawing to E. V. Thaw and Company (founded by Eugene Victor Thaw [born 1927]). Paul Rosenberg\u2019s daughter-in-law, Mrs. Elaine Rosenberg, confirmed that the drawing was in their collection, hanging in the hallway of the New York residence, until transferred to E. V. Thaw and Company in the 1970s (private communication with Mrs. Elaine Rosenberg, June 2, 2014).]; sold by E. V. Thaw and Company, New York, to the Art Institute of Chicago, 1977.",
