    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">A beautiful mechanical puzzle comprising three identical pieces, die-cast in stainless steel and weighing almost 2 pounds. The Venn Puzzle is a surprisingly difficult dexterity challenge and an intriguing addition to your desk, shelf, or coffee table. The assembled puzzle creates a perfect sphere \u2014 so each piece makes up one-third of the sphere by volume. Includes assembly instructions.</span><br data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></p>\n<ul data-mce-fragment=\"1\">\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><strong data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Dimensions:&nbsp;</strong>2.25 in.</li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">1.75 lbs</span></li>\n<li data-mce-fragment=\"1\"><span data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Die-cast Stainless Steel</span></li>\n</ul>",
