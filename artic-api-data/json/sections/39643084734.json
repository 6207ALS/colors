Harrison Collection, 1948.419  \nKornfeld 56 (monogram)  \nFor the inside and back, see fig. 100.1\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Gauguin produced nine issues of Le sourire (The Smile), his \u201cserious newspaper,\u201d as well as three supplements; this issue is the first and did not contain a supplement. Using the new technology of mimeography that he encountered while clerking as a draftsman in Papeete, he created the satirical newspaper for local monthly distribution. The machine that Gauguin used was likely an Edison Mimeograph Model 0. These devices were manufactured in Chicago by the A. B. Dick Company and had only become available in 1897 (see Technical Overview). So popular was the machine, which greatly improved the efficiency of bureaucratic offices, that by the time Gauguin gained access to one in 1899, he described it as \u201call the rage.\u201d It is likely that this duplicating technology also appealed to the artist on a conceptual level, considering his history of experimentation with various transfer processes.\n\nThe format of Le sourire is not immediately intuitive. The unusual orientation of text relative to the folding of the sheets indicates that the journal was intended to be read by turning the pages from left to right. This issue of Le sourire is the first that Gauguin produced with the hope of using the mimeograph to print multiples of text as well as drawings (see Technical Overview). Unfortunately, the technology had limits that thwarted his aesthetic ambitions; the vignettes sprinkled throughout the text were rendered partially illegible due to broken lines and uneven printing. This issue of the journal was illustrated with mimeographed vignettes (fig. 100.2) and a faint wood-block-printed monogram (fig. 100.3). In later issues of the journal, he turned exclusively to wood-block printing for his illustrations.\n\nThe issue was printed by applying brownish-black ink through a mimeograph stencil. The stencil itself was responsible for the grainy appearance of the text and illustrations (see Technical Overview). The vignette on page two is additionally hand colored with touches of pink watercolor (fig. 100.4). It is the only example examined to date for this study in which hand coloring appears. On the last page, the artist\u2019s caricature presides over his writing (fig. 100.5). The wood-block-printed monogram, also on page two, is faintly printed in ocher ink.\n\nThe paper that Gauguin selected is only slightly higher quality than newsprint. It is a thin, soft, short-fibered paper with a slight texture that is visible in transmitted light. Because the paper was formatted for use with the mimeograph machine and because Gauguin was notoriously low on money and supplies, it is possible that he procured this paper from the office where he worked and where he returned to do his mimeograph printing. This same paper appears again in Gauguin\u2019s later work, including the transfer drawings Woman with a Cat (cat. 123) and Sister of Charity (cat. 125).\n\n383 \u00d7 497 mm (full sheet); 383 \u00d7 250 mm (folded sheet); 32 mm (diameter of printed monogram)\n\nThe issue is in fair condition. It was mended along the edges and central folds, but it cannot be determined when this was done.  \nMary Broadway and Harriet K.
