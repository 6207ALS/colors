    "description": "<p>Having worked as a bank clerk in Paris, Victor Dubreuil moved to the United States in 1882, possibly to escape charges that he had stolen money from his employer. In New York he established himself as an artist, specializing in ultra-illusionistic depictions of currency: some elaborate in composition while others more restrained, such as <em>One Dollar Silver Certificate</em>. In the late 19th century, counterfeiting of legal tender was a widespread problem. Trompe l\u2019oeil replications\u2014albeit on canvas or board rather than paper\u2014aroused suspicion among government officials. At least two of Dubreuil\u2019s paintings on public view were confiscated by the Secret Service in the 1890s.</p>\n",
