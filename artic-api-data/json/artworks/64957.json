    "description": "<p>This is one of a group of related canvases featuring seasonal fruit that Vincent van Gogh painted in the fall of 1887. In these works, he simplified his palette, employed more vibrant colors, and used a thicker, broader paint application than he had earlier. Here he explored the use of complementary colors\u2014yellow and purple, blue and orange, and red and green\u2014in the service of chromatic intensity. The effect of these color contrasts is heightened by the pulsating pattern of brushstrokes that defines the tablecloth and creates a force field around the fruit. The painting was probably among the \u201cviolent still lifes\u201d\u2014to quote Van Gogh\u2019s friend the painter <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/33617\">Emile Bernard</a>\u2014that he included in the group exhibition of young avant-garde artists that he organized at a local restaurant in November\u2013December 1887.</p>\n",
