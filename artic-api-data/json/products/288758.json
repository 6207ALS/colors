    "description": "<p>An eye-opening presentation of largely unknown figurative drawings by a renowned pioneer of abstraction</p>\n<p>Featuring one hundred figurative works on paper by Ellsworth Kelly (1923\u20132015), this volume shows a new side of an artist best known for abstraction. These informal depictions of friends and expressive self-portraits\u2014all rarely or never previously displayed or published\u2014span the entirety of Kelly\u2019s career, from the mid-1940s to the early 2000s. Throughout his life, Kelly made portraits as a means of keeping his hand adept at drawing, which provided a place to test his ideas, refine his bold use of lines, and interrogate the space between naturalism and abstraction. These works also capture his social milieu, which intersected with other creative circles and the queer community. He painstakingly recorded how his own appearance changed over time, and once described some of these sketches by saying, \u201cI use myself in order to draw.\u201d The accompanying critical essays unpack the ways in which such intimate efforts were fundamental to Kelly\u2019s practice and situate this important aspect of his work within the artist\u2019s wider oeuvre.</p>\n<p>Edited by Kevin Salatino and Emily Vokt Ziemba<br>Contributions by Jordan Carter, Richard Meyer, Susan Tallman and Jack Shear</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Hardcover</li>\n<li><strong>Dimensions:</strong> 8 x 10 in.</li>\n<li><strong>Pages:</strong> 190</li>\n<li><strong>Illustrations:</strong> 130 color</li>\n</ul>",
