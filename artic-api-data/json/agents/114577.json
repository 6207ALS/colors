Their unconventional displays of bright, bold graphic work garnered local and national attention, transforming the artistic landscape of Chicago and influencing subsequent generations of artists around the world.</p><p>The Hairy Who consisted of six artists, all recent graduates of the School of the Art Institute: <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/110896\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Falconer</a> (1943\u20132022), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/34732\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Art Green</a> (born 1941), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36022\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gladys Nilsson</a> (born 1940), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36059\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jim Nutt</a> (born 1938), <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/36413\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Suellen Rocca</a> (1943\u20132020), and <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/37327\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Karl Wirsum</a> (1939\u20132021). Although the members of the Hairy Who were determined to make names for themselves as individuals, they decided that the best way to gain recognition was to join forces and exhibit together. The sensational success of their first three exhibitions, all mounted at the Hyde Park Art Center on the city\u2019s South Side in the mid-1960s, led to three further presentations of their work on the East and West Coasts.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/2722/hairy-who-19661969\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">2018 exhibition</a> at the Art Institute\u2014the first-ever major survey dedicated solely to the Hairy Who\u2014showcased each individual artist while also exploring the far-reaching influence of the group\u2019s distinct aesthetic.</p>",
