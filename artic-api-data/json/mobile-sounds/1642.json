    "transcript": "<p>NARRATOR: In this scene by Ludovico Carracci, the earthly and heavenly realms almost seem to touch one another.  This is brought about with a vision of St. Francis of Assisi, in which he saw the Virgin Mary.  Here she looks down at him majestically from Heaven, having given him the Christ Child to hold.  Curator Eve Straussman-Pflanzer:</p>\n<p>EVE STRAUSSMAN-PFLANZER: There's extreme care and attention paid to his expression of devotion.  There's even a small dab of white paint in his right eye that almost is a suggestion of a tear forming.  He is moved, and one should understand this as a religious and devotional painting that a patron could have used in their own home to meditate on this vision of Christ.</p>\n<p>NARRATOR: The image is painted on copper, giving it an incredibly smooth, jewel-like surface.  It also intensifies the radiance of the heavenly light that emanates from the Virgin and Child.</p>\n",
