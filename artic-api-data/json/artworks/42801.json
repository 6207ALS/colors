    "description": "<p>During the late 18th century, Japanese culture was strongly influenced by Chinese traditions, such as the steeped-tea ceremony (<em>sencha</em>) illustrated here, and the demand for Chinese-style rituals increased tremendously. Intellectuals, samurai, well-educated townspeople, and artists came to advocate <em>sencha</em>, partly as a reaction against the conventionalism of <em>chanoyu</em> system. Large-scale production of the objects used in the ceremony, often based on imported Chinese objects, accompanied the growing interest in the <em>sencha</em>. Here Nagayama Kien depicted typical objects used in the sencha ceremony.<br>This is a memorial <em>surimono</em> for the 50-year anniversary of the death of the Takemoto school <em>gidayu</em> chanter Takemoto Sakidayu I (died 1779). Sakidayu worked as a chanter in Osaka and Kyoto Kabuki theaters. This print was commissioned by Machi and Yotsu Sakidayu and their family to celebrate their grandfather.</p>\n",
