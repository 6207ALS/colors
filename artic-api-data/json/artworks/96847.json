As she described: \u201cI was just testing things out on a stone. It was the first I\u2019d ever done, so I just took different symbols and worked them out. I didn\u2019t try to think of a composition. I just put it all on.\u201d</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the forms\u2014her signature black holes, cosmic bursts, insect-like carapaces, mutant sea creatures\u2014are laid out with careful attention to the composition.</p>\n",
