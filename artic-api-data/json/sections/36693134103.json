The woman\u2014likely Renoir\u2019s favorite model of the late 1870s, Nini Lopez\u2014plays an upright piano appropriate for modest living quarters. The interior furnishings depicted in this painting are not opulent but are typical of a bourgeois home of the 1870s: an oriental carpet, subdued wall coverings in dark colors, and a fringed portiere to divide rooms. In the background on the left, a large, glazed ceramic planter with a footed base, remarkable for its iridescence, may be of chinoiserie design. Above the piano hangs a pastel or print framed in a mat, another sign of middle-class living. The bound volumes of music on top of the piano, piled together with loose, illustrated sheets that often accompanied popular tunes, hint at the pianist\u2019s broad repertoire. As the writer \u00c9mile Zola related in his novel Nana of 1879, learning to play the piano was a common element of a middle-class French girl\u2019s education, along with English lessons. The comfortable ambience of the room in Woman at the Piano places it outside Renoir\u2019s rue Saint-Georges studio, which was described as a rectangular room furnished with old armchairs, where three walls were covered in gray wallpaper and a third was entirely glazed for maximum light.\n\nSensuality was often an aspect of Renoir\u2019s paintings of the Parisienne\u2014a woman dressed in the latest fashion\u2014which were intended primarily for the enjoyment of the wealthy male viewer. Woman at the Piano can be considered an image of the Parisienne because the peignoir is the star of the painting, occupying most of the picture and making the canvas the equivalent of a fashion plate. The raised viewing angle opens up the foreground to accommodate the full extent of the flowing skirt. The artist made adjustments to the piano, which in overall profile appears more foreshortened in the X-ray, suggesting that he stepped back from the subject in order to encompass the woman\u2019s entire figure in the composition; the artist also lowered his point of view to a slightly less steep angle (fig. 3.1). Demonstrating an expressive and gestural technique, Renoir rendered the peignoir to appear as a willowy mass of brushwork over an off-white or beige underlayer painted over with white, blue, and some light green, all blended together to convey the garment\u2019s voluminous folds (fig. 3.2). The only lines are the dark blue decorative trim. Blended blue shadow becomes more dominant toward the bottom of the peignoir, in keeping with a diminishing light source. Originally painted over a larger area, the peignoir was slimmed and the line of the woman\u2019s lower back was adjusted to include more of the piano seat (see Application/technique and artist\u2019s revisions in the technical report). The flattened perspective and graphic outline of the peignoir that result from Renoir\u2019s elaborate handling recall the gowns of female saints in altarpieces of the Northern Renaissance artist Jan van Eyck.\n\nComparable sensuality in an interior setting can be seen in A Girl Crocheting (fig. 3.3 [Daulte 154; Dauberville 390]). This painting is a genre scene with little emphasis on the fashion or urbanity present in the image of the Parisienne. The woman shares the long red hair of the figure in Woman at the Piano and might also be Nini Lopez, whom Renoir employed from 1875 to 1880 and who was known for being \u201cpunctual, serious, and discreet.\u201d By showing her in A Girl Crocheting with a bared shoulder and her hair unbound and flowing down her back, Renoir introduced eroticism into an otherwise traditional genre painting\u2014not unlike the effect he achieved with the peignoir in Woman at the Piano. With its iridescent blue vase and mantel ornaments that include a framed picture, the dark interior of A Girl Crocheting is also comparable to that in Woman at the Piano. In both works comfortable, fashionable surroundings are combined with an alluring image of femininity. Renoir heightened the sensuality of Woman at the Piano with subtle adjustments to the figure. In the X-ray the woman\u2019s face is profil perdu (fig. 3.4). In the final placement of the figure in full profile Renoir showed her youthful features to better advantage. The X-ray also indicates that the woman\u2019s hair was at an earlier stage gathered low at the back of her head, while in the final composition it is swept up to reveal more of her neck.\n\nOne can get a good sense of how Renoir transformed the subject of the woman at the piano into an image of the Parisienne by comparing it to a contemporary work by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Samuel Cordey, Captive Audience of 1877 (fig. 3.5). In this painting the instrument is also placed in the corner of a room decorated with wallpaper and framed pictures; however, both the plain design of the pianist\u2019s day dress and the meditative pose of her companion place this scene some distance from the sensual retreat of Renoir\u2019s painting. The dull wall color, uniform ambient lighting, and mundane furnishings of Cordey\u2019s interior are pedestrian and undistinguished compared to the elegance and visual appeal displayed in Woman at the Piano.\n\nWhile the emphasis on fashion and femininity in Woman at the Piano marks it as a representation of the Parisienne, the depiction of a woman playing the piano alone in an interior setting defines it as a genre painting or a view of everyday life. The theme of young women at the piano was one that Renoir would make his own in the 1890s, when the French State acquired Young Girls at the Piano (fig. 3.6 [Dauberville 993]), the first work by the artist to enter the collection of contemporary art housed in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg, the occasion that marks the beginning of the artist\u2019s official recognition. Such a significant career milestone makes Woman at the Piano all the more compelling, as it is the artist\u2019s first treatment of a piano-playing subject. It was his only example of the theme until 1888, when he painted the portrait commission The Daughters of Catulle Mend\u00e8s (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Daulte 545; Dauberville 966]).\n\nRenoir seems to have come late to the theme of the woman at the piano compared to his Impressionist colleagues. Certainly there was a commercial necessity to expand the range of his successful Parisienne images and genre repertoire. Alternatively it could be argued that his growing social circle of poets and musicians in the mid-1870s may have alerted him to the broader context in which painting, music, and the arts coexisted. What kinds of tunes are shown in the stack of music in Woman at the Piano: popular operettas, classical sonatas, works by German composer Richard Wagner? The relative merits of these musical styles would have been as passionate a point of discussion as painting technique and color for many of Renoir\u2019s friends in the 1870s. In his biography of Renoir, Georges Rivi\u00e8re devoted an entire chapter to Ernest Cabaner, a pianist and early supporter of the Impressionists who lived in Montmartre on the rue de Clichy until his death in 1881. Renoir\u2019s inner circle also included gifted pianists Edmond Ma\u00eetre and Emmanuel Chabrier. In the larger salons, where dozens of socialites would gather for gossip and conversation, music had a substantial role in the entertainment of guests. Renoir\u2019s caricature of the novelist Alphonse Daudet at the piano wearing an evening jacket (fig. 3.7) suggests a command performance at one of these events. The more intimate surroundings in Woman at the Piano evoke the idea of an active listening experience on the part of the viewer. It is a painting addressed to a client drawn to the fashionably dressed Parisienne, yet one who may also have supported progressive music as openly as progressive art.\n\nIt is fairly certain that Woman at the Piano was the work exhibited at the second Impressionist exhibition in April 1876 as Femme au piano, since it is the only work of that title dating from the 1870s. Renoir submitted eighteen works to the exhibition, including Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise (The Rowers\u2019 Lunch) (1875; cat. 2). This work received only a brief mention by the critics, and Woman at the Piano was passed over completely. Much of the commentary about Renoir\u2019s work focused on his controversial female torso, titled \u00c9tude (fig. 3.8 [Daulte 201; Dauberville 603]). Art critics more comfortable with the academic nude in historic or mythological contexts found Renoir\u2019s provocative play of light and shadow on human flesh in a garden setting deeply disturbing. The powerful and influential critic of Le figaro, Albert Wolff, compared the nude to a mass of decomposing flesh. Woman at the Piano is equally innovative in its lighting of the figure. The brilliant whites of the flowing peignoir and the woman\u2019s glowing flesh tones visible through the sheer fabric of her sleeve suggest conditions of bright sunlight seemingly at odds with the somber tones of the apartment\u2019s interior. Direct sunlight from a window would presumably cast distinct shadows, but no such shadows are apparent.\n\nOne of the few positive comments about Renoir\u2019s work at the 1876 exhibition came from Zola, who had been a supporter of the Impressionists for a decade. Zola\u2019s review was sympathetic: \u201cM. Renoir is above all a figure painter. He favors a blonde palette of colors that lighten and blend with an admirable harmony. One would say these are works by Rubens lit by the strongest sunlight of Vel\u00e1zquez.\u201d While Zola did not mention Woman at the Piano, his review nevertheless raises the question of Renoir\u2019s engagement with the Old Masters in 1875\u201376 and how these sources might have played a role in the inspiration for the painting. The theme of the woman at the piano can be traced to seventeenth-century Dutch artists such as Gabriel Metsu, whose Lady at the Virginals (1662; Petit Palais, Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris) was reproduced in Charles Blanc\u2019s Histoire de peintres de toutes les \u00e9coles: \u00c9cole hollandaise in 1862. Another Dutch work, Johannes Vermeer\u2019s A Young Woman Standing at a Virginal (fig. 3.9), appeared in an exhibition of Old Master paintings from private collections held in Paris in 1866. Vermeer\u2019s work had not been previously seen in a Paris exhibition and was just beginning to be understood by French art historians. In 1870 the Louvre acquired its first painting by Vermeer, The Lace Maker of 1669/70, which later became a highlight of Renoir\u2019s visits to the museum. While it is uncertain how familiar Renoir would have been with Vermeer\u2019s work in the mid-1870s, Woman at the Piano succeeds magnificently in updating the traditional paradigm of painting\u2019s relationship to music by merging Impressionist concerns with color and light with references to history, tradition, and the attentive listener.  \nJohn Collins\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section technical_report\" id=\"technical_report\">Renoir began with a commercially primed canvas and roughly separated broad areas of the compositional space with thin layers of opaque paint; a thin, dark-red wash was used to define the piano on the right. This dark red extends past the apparent foldover edge and may indicate that the artist began his composition on an unstretched canvas or on a canvas on a slightly larger, nonstandard stretcher that he later moved to a smaller stretcher. With a relatively limited palette, Renoir created textural differences by manipulating the paint in many ways, including thin washes, scraping, thick impasto, wet-in-wet modeling, and dragging a stiff brush across wet paint. X-radiography indicates compositional changes to both the figure and the piano. Renoir established the initial forms of these elements and brought the background in around them before making subsequent changes to the composition. He altered the figure\u2019s pose\u2014originally in profile, in the final composition she is turned slightly toward the viewer\u2014as well as her dress and hairstyle. After executing the figure in her initial form, Renoir slimmed her overall silhouette and greatly diminished the volume of her skirt. Her hair was altered from a simple, downswept roll to an upswept style with added volume at the crown. The piano was widened, perhaps painted from a different perspective. Initially the overall profile of the piano was more foreshortened, projecting farther into space; however, the top of the piano was slightly less foreshortened, signaling a change in vantage not only farther to the left with respect to the subject, but perhaps also slightly lower. Once the figure and the piano were executed in their final forms, the artist smoothed the transition between figure and ground with a combination of wet-in-wet modeling and working thin, translucent layers over dry paint.\n\nThe multilayer interactive image viewer is designed to facilitate the viewer\u2019s exploration and comparison of the technical images (fig. 3.10).\n\nSigned: Renoir. (lower left, in warm-black paint) (fig. 3.11, fig. 3.12).\n\nFlax (commonly known as linen).\n\nMeasuring from a ridge around the perimeter that appears to be a flattened foldover, the original dimensions appear to be approximately 91.5 \u00d7 73 cm; cusping visible in the X-ray corresponds to tack placement for this size. This most likely corresponds to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size (92 \u00d7 73 cm) canvas.\n\nDetermining the original size of the canvas is complicated by many factors, as the dimensions may have been changed by the artist and the original foldover edge does not appear to be a straight line. Additional canvas was left exposed around the perimeter when the painting was lined, and during the same treatment it was mounted slightly askew.\n\nAspects of the painting\u2019s construction suggest that Renoir may have changed the size of the canvas himself after beginning his composition off the stretcher or stretched to a larger secondary support. The work features uneven edges on all sides, the straightest of which appears to be the left. Folding the painting at the apparent foldover on the right would also make it correspond to a no. 30 portrait (figure) standard-size canvas; some sense of the original dimensions and the nature of the original edges are more apparent in clean-state photos from the 1972 treatment (fig. 3.13). The artist appears to have lined up the painting for stretching on a standard stretcher by the left side, folding over a small portion of the scraped-back, dark-red piano paint (fig. 3.14). After numerous compositional changes, small margins of background paint on the lower left and upper right were likely added by Renoir to square the composition to fit a standard size.\n\nPlain weave. Average thread count (standard deviation): 22.4V (0.8) \u00d7 26.1H (0.5) threads/cm. The horizontal threads were determined to correspond to the warp and the vertical threads to the weft.\n\nThe canvas has mild cusping on the top, bottom, and left edges, corresponding to the placement of the original tacks. On the right, cusping corresponds to the inner set of tack holes (visible along the foldover edge) rather than to the secondary set of tack holes on the current tacking margin (fig. 3.15). There is a double thread fault on the lower left (fig. 3.16).\n\nCurrent stretching: When the painting was lined in 1937, it was placed slightly askew, and the original dimensions were increased on all sides by up to 1 cm. It is possible that the right margin was also extended as part of this treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretching: Based on cusping visible in the X-ray, the original tacks were placed approximately 3.5\u20137 cm apart.\n\nCurrent stretcher: Five-member keyable stretcher with a horizontal crossbar. This stretcher is not believed to be original to the painting and probably dates from the 1937 treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nOriginal stretcher: Unknown.\n\nNo manufacturer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s marks were observed during the current examination or documented in previous examinations.\n\nCross-sectional analysis indicates a thin, brownish layer of material between the canvas and the ground that closely follows the canvas texture. This material is organic, based on its characteristic bluish fluorescence in UV light, and is estimated to be glue (fig. 3.17).\n\nThere is a smooth, single-layer, commercially applied ground, approximately 10\u201340 \u00b5m thick, that extends to the edges of the tacking margins (fig. 3.18).\n\nThe ground appears to be warm white, with dark particles visible under stereomicroscopic examination (fig. 3.19). Small percentages of black and iron oxide yellow and red were found in cross-sectional analysis and contribute to this warm appearance. This layer is porous and has darkened over time due to the combined effects of accumulated grime and saturation by the wax-resin lining material (see Conservation History and Condition Summary).\n\nThe ground is predominantly lead white, with small amounts of calcium-based white, iron oxide yellow and red (and associated silicates), and traces of bone black, complex silicates, and barium sulfate extenders. The binder is estimated to be oil.\n\nNo underdrawing was observed with infrared reflectography or under stereomicroscopic examination.\n\nRenoir began the painting by laying in localized colors, some in opaque layers, and loosely defining various areas of the composition. On the upper left and across much of the top, a bright-white underlayer serves to visually brighten the top half of the painting (fig. 3.20). Underneath the figure and foreground, however, the underlayers appear thick and beige, a color very similar to that of the ground. It is unclear whether this beige layer was intended to function like the white in the top half of the composition or was used to cover previous compositional choices in certain areas. Comparatively wide strokes (up to 3 cm wide) of this warm beige are seen in raking-light and X-ray images throughout the left foreground rug, on either side of the dress (fig. 3.21).\n\nOn the right, the artist used a dark-red wash for the piano that extends past the apparent original foldover edge. The paint along this edge is very thin, appears scraped back and abraded, and includes only the lower layers of paint and none of the upper details of the gold ornament on the side of the piano or the music books on top of the piano. It is possible that Renoir began the work off the stretcher or on a larger, nonstandard stretcher and later shortened it to correspond to a standard-size stretcher. The paint layers present on the far right edge suggest that this change was made before the upper layers of the piano were added. The artist scraped back the paint along the right side and may have changed the size of the work before changing the angle of the piano and adding details such as the gold decorative ornament and the sheet music (fig. 3.22). Once the work was stretched, he \u201csquared\u201d the composition on the upper right and lower left with additional background paint. As these areas lack the previously mentioned opaque underpaints that define their surroundings, they appear quite different in color and texture than the rest of the canvas, but they do appear to be original.\n\nRenoir made substantial changes to both the figure and the piano in this composition. The X-ray indicates that the piano originally appeared thinner and taller. The top of the piano was painted from a slightly downward perspective, with more of the surface visible and featuring additional sheet music and a curved decorative element. The top now appears more foreshortened, and the overall profile of the piano is wider and angled more toward the viewer (fig. 3.15). The sheet music just above the keyboard appears longer and curved in the X-ray, possibly indicating turning or buckling pages, and a radio-opaque form just under the music suggests that a music ledge was articulated at this stage. The X-ray also suggests that the artist raised the position of the candlesticks and altered the curve along the side and legs of the piano in the foreground.\n\nRenoir made numerous changes to the figure\u2019s hairstyle, dress, and profile. Originally her hair, swept down smoothly along the side of her head, was tucked back in a simple roll. Brushstrokes in the hair indicate that the artist simply layered thin strokes in a different direction over the previous arrangement to suggest a more upswept style with added volume at the crown (fig. 3.23). Traction cracking in this area resulted from the thinness of these layers compared to the heavier paint underneath, a trait also visible in raking light. In the X-ray, the figure\u2019s dress appears more voluminous, bowing out around the knees and coming in atop a larger ruffled bottom. The skirt seems to bend in on itself, and the piano seat is almost entirely hidden by it. A radio-transparent band along this inward fold of the skirt indicates that it was originally higher than it appears in the visible composition. In the final arrangement, Renoir reduced the volume of the skirt on both sides of the piano seat, revealing more of the seat and cushion and giving definition to the bottom half of the figure. The artist slimmed her overall silhouette, straightened her neck, and brought up her neck and chin slightly to suggest a more upright posture. The figure appears in full profile, with her head angled more toward the viewer. To accomplish this, Renoir moved her forehead, chin, eyes, and hairline slightly to the left with respect to her nose (fig. 3.24). A visible buildup of the paint in the flesh tones, where the artist subtly altered the head, can be seen in raking light. The figure\u2019s arms remain in the same position in the X-ray and the final composition, but her left hand was moved farther back in space, and paint revealed by cracking in this area indicates that the ruffle at the cuff of her sleeve was probably extended after the wrist was executed (fig. 3.25). Similar cracks also reveal that the artist added flesh tones over the white of the sleeve to create the illusion of a translucent garment.\n\nRenoir established both the female figure and the piano before bringing in the background. In the X-ray, heavy strokes of background paint come up to and around these elements; this is especially noticeable around the figure\u2019s head, where a kind of radio-opaque halo is visible. After the artist settled on the final composition, he softened the transition between figure and ground with additional background paint applied either wet-in-wet or in thin, translucent layers over dry paint.\n\nRenoir\u2019s paint application varies in thickness and texture, from washes and areas scraped with a palette knife, to heavy impasto and visible brushwork (fig. 3.26). The artist mixed many hues directly on the surface of the painting, working wet-in-wet to varying degrees to produce smooth blending, as seen in the figure\u2019s dress and flesh (fig. 3.27). In some areas, short strokes of color or highlights pick up a small amount of the surrounding paint, as on the vase on the left (fig. 3.28). To create the illusion of individual strands of hair framing the figure\u2019s face, Renoir dragged a stiff brush across wet paint, allowing the bristles to cut through and reveal the light underpaint (fig. 3.29). The artist also added details in very dry paint, dragging his brush across the surface, as in the foliage, highlights on the candlesticks, parts of the vase, and upper details of the foreground rug (fig. 3.30).\n\nSoft- and stiff-bristle brushes (strokes up to 1 cm wide); palette knife for scraping; possible wider brushes (strokes about 3 cm wide) used in the foreground underlayers.\n\nAnalysis indicates the presence of the following pigments: lead white, zinc white, cobalt blue, cerulean blue, emerald green, viridian, chrome yellow, zinc yellow, bone black, vermilion, madder lake, carmine lake, iron oxide red, and red lead.\n\nAnalysis suggests that the paint mixtures vary in their complexity, with some simpler mixtures of two or three pigments and other more complex combinations. The flesh tones, for example, contain lead white, vermilion, and red lake. The dark-blue ribbon running through the lower portion of the figure\u2019s dress, however, is more complex; in addition to cobalt blue, there is some cerulean blue and chrome yellow, with traces of bone black, zinc yellow, and possibly red lake. The observation of a characteristic bright orange fluorescence under UV light indicates that the artist used a fluorescing red lake in the flesh tones, parts of the front of the piano, and the figure\u2019s hair (fig. 3.31). It is likely that Renoir used a different red lake for the main body of the piano. Cross-sectional analysis of a sample from the piano indicates that the artist mixed both lakes; in UV light, the fluorescing and nonfluorescing red lakes are visible side by side (fig. 3.32).\n\nOil (estimated).\n\nThe current synthetic varnish was applied in 1972, replacing a natural-resin varnish. It is unclear whether the natural-resin varnish dates from the 1937 lining or from a proposed 1940 treatment (see Conservation History).\n\nThe painting was treated by Chicago private conservator Leo Marzolo just before it was acquired by the Art Institute in 1937. Treatment at this time included wax-resin lining to a secondary canvas and mounting the lined canvas onto Masonite before restretching the entire structure on a five-member keyable stretcher. The painting was minimally scratched in transit in 1940 and repaired in November of the same year by Marzolo. The examination report for this treatment confirmed that the work was already wax-resin lined, \u201cthen placed onto Masonite.\u201d This record also indicated dissatisfaction with the surface coating and recommended removing the excess wax and replacing it with a wax-damar-mastic mixture. As there is no further documentation, both the specific nature of the previous coating and whether this treatment was completed remain unclear.\n\nThe work was superficially treated in 1969, including grime removal with detergent water, thinning of the surface coating, toning of discolored retouching, and resaturation of the surface with three coats of synthetic varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA). The painting was treated again in 1972 in preparation for exhibition. An aged natural-resin varnish and extensive retouching along the edges were removed, along with the 1969 synthetic varnish system, at this time with a combination of solvent and mechanical cleaning. The painting was again given a three-layer varnish (an isolating layer of polyvinyl acetate [PVA] AYAA, followed by methacrylate resin L-46, and a final coat of AYAA) and retouched. Heavy retouching along the edges compensates for the slightly skewed lining and the abraded paint along the right edge.\n\nThe painting is in good condition, planar and with few losses. It is wax-resin lined to a secondary canvas and is secure. A piece of Masonite was inserted between the lined painting and the restoration stretcher, but it is unclear at this time whether the Masonite panel is attached to the painting with adhesive or held in place by the pressure of the stretching. The overall flatness and planarity of the painting and increased textural presence of the weave are the result of the lining process. The original tacking margins were flattened during the lining process, making the original dimensions somewhat unclear and causing abrasion and minor losses around the perimeter. The work was stretched slightly askew and has been retouched along the left edge near the bottom, the bottom edge on the right, parts of the upper edge, and the entire right side to compensate. Cracking appears to be limited to the figure\u2019s dress, along the arms and shoulders and at the knee, and along areas of dark blue, including the ribbon detail and the shadowed piano seat. The work is slightly saturated by a combination of lining material and a somewhat glossy synthetic varnish.  \nKelly Keegan\n\nCurrent frame (installed 2008): The frame is not original to the painting. It is a French (Parisian), late-seventeenth-century, Louis XIV convex frame with alternating acanthus leaves, scrolls, and flowers on a hazzled bed with ribbon-and-leaf sight molding. The frame has water gilding over red and red brown bole on gesso. The ornament and sight moldings are selectively burnished; all other gilding is matte. The frame retains its original gilding and glue sizing. The carved oak molding is mitered and joined with angled, dovetailed splines. The molding, from the perimeter to the interior, is ovolo with flowers outer molding; scotia side; convex face with alternating acanthus leaves, scrolls, and flowers on a hazzled, recut bed; cove frieze; and torus with ribbon-and-leaf sight molding (fig. 3.33).\n\nPrevious frame (installed sometime after 1937, removed 2008): The painting was previously housed in an American, twentieth-century, Louis XVI reproduction, fluted scotia frame with corner acanthus leaves, made of carved basswood with a distressed gilt finish (fig. 3.34).\n\nPrevious frame (installed prior to or upon the 1911 purchase by the Ryerson family; removed after 1937): The work was previously housed in a late-nineteenth-century, Louis XIV Revival, reverse ogee frame with straight sides and projecting cast plaster fleur-de-lis corner cartouches connected by a symmetrical rhythm of scroll-linked fleurs-de-lis on a quadrillage bed. The frame had an outer leaf-tip and inner linked-bellflower molding with cove sight edge, and an independent fillet liner with cove sight edge (fig. 3.35, fig. 3.36).  \nKirk Vuillemot\n\n</section><section class=\"osci-tk-epub-section provenance\" id=\"provenance\">Acquired by Paul-Victor Poupin, Paris, by Apr. 1876.\n\nPossibly acquired by Durand-Ruel, Paris, by Apr. 1883.\n\nSold (possibly by Renoir) to Durand-Ruel, Paris, Sept. 8, 1886, for 1,200 francs.\n\nPossibly sold at Moore\u2019s Art Galleries, New York, May 6, 1887, lot 93, for $675.\n\nAcquired by Durand-Ruel, New York, by Dec. 16, 1911.\n\nSold by Durand-Ruel, New York, to Martin A.

The article does not specify under which catalogue number or title the painting was exhibited, but it is possible that it was cat. 19, Fillette en robe bleue, 1876.)\n\nThe painting was dated 1875/76 based on research conducted for the publication Douglas W. Druick, Renoir, Artists in Focus (Art Institute of Chicago/Abrams, 1997). This date takes into consideration the fact that Renoir included the painting in the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876, and allows for the possibility that he may have started the painting the previous year.\n\nSee Gloria Groom, \u201cThe Social Network of Fashion,\u201d and Justine De Young, \u201cFashion and Intimate Portraits,\u201d in Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, ed.

Before Cabaner\u2019s premature death in August 1881, a diverse group would often gather at his apartment to hear these songs and to listen to recitals by other young French composers. It was there that Emmanuel Chabrier performed czardas (Hungarian folk tunes), as well as his own lyrical compositions, to the delight of an elite audience including Rivi\u00e8re and Renoir.

Collins, \u201cChristine Lerolle Embroidering: Between Genre Painting and Portraiture,\u201d in Ann Dumas and John Collins, Renoir\u2019s Women (Columbus Museum of Art/Merrell, 2005), pp. 87\u2013111, esp. pp. 99\u2013100.\n\nUsing the toolbar at the bottom right, any two images of the painting may be selected for comparison by clicking the layers icon to the right of the slider bar. The slider bar may be moved to transition back and forth between the two chosen images. The jagged line icon brings up a list of available annotations, or colored lines that show the significant features visible in each image, which may be turned on or off in any combination. For example, the red annotation lines, associated with the natural-light image, trace some of the painting\u2019s key compositional features. When overlaid onto a technical image (X-ray, raking light, UV, etc.), the red outlines help the viewer to better observe how features in the technical image relate to or diverge from the painting as seen with the naked eye. (When annotations are turned on, a legend appears in the upper right showing each color and its associated image type.) The circular arrow icon returns the image to the default settings (natural light, full-image view, natural-light [red] annotation on). The four-arrow icon toggles between the view of the image in the page and a full-screen view of the image. In the upper right corner, the vertical slider bar may be moved to zoom into or out of the image; different parts of the image can be accessed by clicking and dragging within the image itself. The icon in the upper left corner opens a small view of the full image, within which a red box indicates the portion of the overall image being viewed when zooming is enabled.\n\nStereomicroscopic examination suggests the presence of black and red lake, neither of which would generally be detected with XRF. Red lake can also be verified by the faint orange fluorescence noted in this area when viewed under UV light (see Palette).\n\nFlax was confirmed by microscopic cross-sectional fiber identification; see Inge Fiedler, \u201c1937\\_1025\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Nov. 29, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nSee the chart of standard sizes available from Bourgeois A\u00een\u00e9 in 1888, reproduced in David Bomford, Jo Kirby, John Leighton, and Ashok Roy, Art in the Making: Impressionism, exh. cat. (National Gallery, London/Yale University Press, 1990), p. 46, fig. 31. The original dimensions were determined by approximating foldover edges based on creases and old tack holes. Small discrepancies between the current measurements and the standard size may be a result of this approximation, in addition to the restretching, lining, slacking, and keying out that the canvas has undergone over time.\n\nThe painting is listed in a 1933 catalogue as measuring 35 7/8 \u00d7 28 1/8 in. (91.1 \u00d7 71.4 cm), but its condition and treatment history at that time are unknown, and the measurements may reflect the sight size. The painting is listed again in 1935 at 36 1/2 \u00d7 29 in., roughly its current measurements. Documentation suggests that it was lined in 1937, so the change in the dimensions may date from an earlier, undocumented treatment. See Art Institute of Chicago, Catalogue of \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d: Exhibition of Paintings and Sculptures; Lent from American Collections, ed. Daniel Catton Rich, exh. cat.

Barnes and Violette de Mazia, The Art of Renoir (Minton, Balch, 1935), p. 451.\n\nThread count and weave information were determined by Thread Count Automation Project software. See Don H. Johnson and Robert G. Erdmann, \u201cThread Count Report: Woman at the Piano, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, 1875\u20131876 (D187/1937.1025),\u201d Jan. 2012.\n\nRobert Harshe, Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, to restorer Leo Marzolo, Sept. 20, 1937; Daniel Catton Rich, Associate Curator of Painting, to J. Francis McCabe, Art Institute of Chicago Superintendent, Sept. 24, 1937, both on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago. Both letters refer to the proposed treatment of the painting and estimate the cost of treatment. While there is no further documentation of this treatment, the current condition of the painting suggests that it was completed.\n\nA cross-section taken from the edge of the tacking margin contains the canvas and all preparatory layers. See Inge Fiedler, \u201c1937\\_1025\\_Renoir\\_analytical\\_report,\u201d Nov. 29, 2013, on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThe presence of lead was confirmed with XRF, SEM/EDX and PLM. SEM/EDX and PLM detected lead white with barium sulfate extenders, and small percentages of iron oxide yellow and red and bone black. Associated complex silicates and calcium sulfate were identified with SEM/EDX. Isolated particles of calcium sulfate, or gypsum, were found in the interstices of the weave, at the juncture between the canvas and the ground layer, and may be part of the sizing; more research and analysis would be needed to confirm this.

The estimation of an oil medium is based on visual examination, as well as on knowledge of Renoir\u2019s technique and published analyses of Renoir\u2019s paintings.\n\nAs part of the 1937 lining process or an earlier treatment, this edge in particular appears to have been extended to reveal the original paint.\n\nThis is true for both versions of the piano.\n\nPigments were identified using the following methods: lead white, cobalt blue, viridian, chrome yellow (XRF, PLM, SEM/EDX); zinc white (XRF, SEM/EDX); emerald green, vermilion, bone black (XRF, PLM 2012 [identified as unspecified black in PLM 1972]); red lakes (PLM, SERS); magnesium-containing cerulean blue, zinc yellow, iron oxide red (SEM/EDX); red lead (PLM).

Analysis was carried out on selected areas and may not include all pigments present in the painting.\n\nThe presence of two different red lakes was noted in PLM (1972, 2012); these were later identified as carmine lake and madder lake with SERS. SEM/EDX indicated that one of the lakes was on a hydrated alumina-type substrate. See Marigene H.

Both documents are on file in the Conservation Department, Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nThough small areas on the front of the piano show characteristic orange fluorescence in UV light, it appears that the rest of the piano was painted with a different red lake. PLM and cross-sectional analysis confirm the presence of two red lakes of slightly different shades, one fluorescing and the other nonfluorescing. Identifying the specific type of lake used only by its autofluorescence under UV is difficult, as many factors, including the type of substrate, binders, varnishes, and admixtures with other pigments, can ultimately affect the perceived color of the fluorescence. Some types of madder and purpurin lake pigments have been reported to fluoresce orange, but other lakes, such as lacs, may fluoresce as well. The characteristics of red lakes, including their fluorescence under UV light, are discussed in Helmut Schweppe and John Winter, \u201cMadder and Alizarin,\u201d in Artists\u2019 Pigments: A Handbook of Their History and Characteristics, vol. 3, ed.
