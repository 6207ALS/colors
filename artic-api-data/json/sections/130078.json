If its motifs form a language, The Temptation of Saint Anthony is a book, its pages filled with words of the artist\u2019s invention. There is humor and light. Billowy clouds fill a sun-drenched sky; viewers read gentleness in the saint\u2019s suppliant face. More typically, however, the narrative is one of violence: a tale of sadism, greed, and depravity. Surrounded by his enemies, eyes shut tight, Ensor\u2019s Anthony prays to a distracted Christ. Death, through murder or malady, is an ever-present threat.\n\nThis troubled tale\u2014as Susan M. Canning\u2019s essay explains\u2014is very much a product of its time. But newly discovered letters written by Ensor reveal that the content of the drawing also relates closely to the artist\u2019s personal experience. From late in 1884 until around 1894, trauma marred his existence. The young man who made this fragile and fragmented work was himself vulnerable and confused. In light of the correspondence, the exploding heads, the writhing worms, and the women with swollen stomachs take on an autobiographical significance. Pages written, pages drawn . . . the boundaries between creative practices became blurred as, sheet by sheet, Ensor committed thoughts and experiences to paper. Crucially, by the time he completed The Temptation, he was no longer a painter of still lifes and the domestic interior but a storyteller in a variety of media.\n\nEnsor corresponded almost as often as he drew. The mycologist Mariette Rousseau was his recipient of choice; a close friend of the artist, she took a keen interest in his work and was happy to hear of his daily life. Over a period of more than twenty-five years, Ensor sent Mariette, her husband (Ernest Rousseau), and her son (his friend Ernest Rousseau junior) around 350 letters, the vast majority of which date from the 1880s and 1890s. Ensor had strong ties to the Rousseau household and looked to its members for guidance and empathy. Mariette was the sister of his erstwhile classmate and confidante Th\u00e9o Hannon and sometimes, on his frequent trips to Brussels, the artist stayed in the Rousseau family home. With their appreciation of art and science, the Rousseaus provided invaluable mental stimulation and introduced Ensor to many new people and ideas. The support they offered was not only emotional and intellectual but also material, for they counted among his important patrons.\n\nIt is unsurprising, then, that Ensor\u2019s friendship with Mariette became integral to his work. Occasionally she appeared in his art, sometimes in controversial images that include Peculiar Insects (1888; D46, Cr46, T46, E46, Tr54a), Plague Here, Plague There, Plague Everywhere (1888; Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp), and Leman and Ensor Discussing Painting (fig. 1). Simultaneously, to improve as a writer, he looked to her for suggested reading. One author she recommended was Gustave Flaubert, who wrote extensively about Saint Anthony\u2019s temptation. Ensor read his work and transcribed some of the author\u2019s letters in an undated carnet. \u201cI\u2019m writing a great deal at the moment. I\u2019d like to acquire what\u2019s known as style,\u201d he explained.\n\nI\u2019m copying the letters from Flaubert to Georges Sand. I find his style very concise, he hardly ever wants a comma. Despite that it\u2019s very profound and makes itself understood (as far as I\u2019m concerned). When I write nicely you\u2019ll see my writings often. I\u2019ll no longer have the worry of seeing Madame Rousseau discover some enormous fault (a missing circumflex, an i without a dot). I\u2019ll sleep well.\n\nEnsor\u2019s wish to develop a literary style in the same decade that he developed his printed and drawn production is particularly relevant to understanding The Temptation. It is clear that in the 1880s he desired to hone his means of communication, both verbal and visual. As his self-expression became more confident, it seems, he felt increasingly unconstrained by the boundaries of media. Thus the Art Institute\u2019s drawing\u2014which is the same size as a large-scale painting\u2014has the intricacy of an etching and the subject matter of a legend, novel, or play. This versatility allowed him to identify with a writer, picking lines from Flaubert\u2019s correspondence to describe his own character: \u201cOh how sometimes one feels close to being mad, especially me,\u201d he quoted in a letter to Mariette. \u201cI am in a singular state of elation or rather of tingling with the least idea that comes to me. I experience something of that singular effect that one feels in the nails when walking past a harp.\u201d In the letter from which Ensor drew, Flaubert speaks of how, in front of a blank page, his thoughts are calmer. Perhaps, as he prepared to write to Mariette or embarked on a new drawing, the artist found similar comfort.\n\nEnsor also copied parts of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s exchanges with Johann Eckermann, in which the two men discussed art and life, with sporadic reference to the natural sciences. Ensor may have sensed a similarity between that exchange and his dialogue with Mariette; his friend\u2014a serious scientist working on a catalogue of mushroom species\u2014might help him better follow the poet\u2019s advice to take note of the real and imagined alike. \u201cThe artist,\u201d Goethe explained, \u201cmust, indeed, in his details faithfully and reverently copy Nature; he must not arbitrarily change the structure of the bones, or the position of the muscles and sinews of an animal, so that the peculiar character is destroyed. This would be annihilating Nature. But in the higher regions of artistical production, by which a picture really becomes a picture, he has freer play and here he may have recourse to fictions.\u201d With hindsight, it appears that as Mariette helped him better understand the nuances of the natural world, Ensor created a \u201cfiction\u201d (a fantasy based in reality) in the form of his Temptation. In his work, just as he blurred the lines between creative practices, he allowed real and unreal to meet and mingle. Lived experience informed Ensor\u2019s work even at its most fantastic.\n\nFamily ties were particularly significant to the artist; although he visited Brussels regularly, his main residence was in Ostend with his parents, his sister Mitche, and his aunt Mimi. Indeed, Ensor\u2019s home life probably inspired one of the most playful areas of The Temptation, for the patch of the head of the pug (fig. 2) that he eventually added below the motley musicians in folio 6H/I likely portrays Gypsy, a much-loved household pet adopted in 1885. Ensor described Gypsy to Mariette as a \u201cminuscule pug that fills the house in the evening with his significant presence. The truly handsome dog sleeps with Aunt Mimi, bites Mitche, and annoys me considerably. . . . The dog deserves these indulgences, he is very smart and quite sensitive. I\u2019ve played Wagner for him; he let out heartrending cries and bit Mitche nastily. He entertains us greatly.\u201d\n\nIn the Ensor household, however, all was not well. The artist was very fond of his father, James Frederic Ensor, but the failed English businessman was an outsider in the community. In addition to his nationality and lack of employment, Ensor senior had a drinking problem. The locals were unimpressed. Some of the personal meaning in The Temptation seems to relate to events that occurred earlier that year when, with alarming brutality, two neighborhood thugs set upon Ensor\u2019s father. The artist witnessed the victim\u2019s return home, and the account he sent to Mariette and her husband makes for harrowing reading. \u201cThe year is starting very badly for us,\u201d he explained:\n\nMy poor father is half-dead, four days ago, three police officers found him soaked in blood, half-conscious, beard and mustache cut, tonsured like a priest, etc. They brought him to the house, the wretch was completely massacred. . . . When carrying him to his room, he covered us in his blood. It was a gruesome sight. Blood fell from the top of the stairs onto Mitche\u2019s head. The poor child is sick, we all are. My father\u2019s head is covered in wounds, according to what he\u2019s told us, some vile scenes must have taken place in a caf\u00e9, after dinner, they must have begun by getting him drunk, then they tonsured him and finally caused serious injury; he doesn\u2019t remember too well what happened next. He named the perpetrators of these vile acts, they are two young men of around thirty years of age, very well known in town and really familiar to us, one of them even came to visit me in the studio frequently.\n\nMy father\u2019s injuries are very serious, his head is literally sliced up with razor cuts and [he has] a very deep wound at the nape of the neck. Despite the atrocity of the attack the guilty may go unpunished. An emissary from the police commissioner went to see my father in hospital. He was silly enough not to want the matter pursued. I don\u2019t know what will happen. . . . The affair has caused a lot of fuss in Ostend, the bandits who did this to my father are from a good family, earlier they passed our house roaring with laughter, the brutes! That\u2019s the Ostend public for you.\n\nYou can well understand that I haven\u2019t the courage to busy myself with my exhibition, nor to come to Brussels. This revolting nocturnal scene has affected me deeply. Forgive me for having described these awful events to you, but Mitche asked me to, she assures me she will feel much better once her distress has been shared with you.\n\nThe attack had serious implications for the victim\u2019s mental health. In June 1885, Ensor senior was admitted to the hospital once again: \u201cHe is as mad as a hatter and can\u2019t be let out of his straitjacket. . . . We can\u2019t go and see him. We are trying to get him into a hospice, for if he stays in Ostend he will get himself knocked out again or drown himself in jenever.\u201d Following these events, Ensor began to feel isolated even from his family. \u201cMitche and my mother aren\u2019t too dismayed about my father\u2019s breakdown,\u201d he observed with some bitterness.\n\nOver the course of a two-year period, in his letters Ensor sometimes mentioned visits to (or unplanned encounters with) his father. While he found solace in writing to Mariette, he explored profound issues in his art, perhaps inspired by the recent troubles at home. It was in 1885, for instance, that he began work on his drawing series Visions: The Aureoles of Christ or the Sensibilities of Light. It includes The Rising: Christ Shown to the People (1885; Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent), in which Jesus appears lonely and ostracized.\n\nBy June 1886 Ensor senior had returned home in poor health, but there was worse to come. On April 14, 1887, at half past one in the morning, the family found his lifeless body at the foot of his bed. Ensor asked Mariette to send his mourning clothes from Brussels. Naturally, in the months to come, the artist felt his loss severely. Guilt accentuated his suffering; he believed he could have done more and cursed the local people. \u201cThey have caused my father\u2019s death,\u201d he bewailed. \u201cHe was so intelligent and so handsome. If I have any talent at all it comes from him. Nevertheless, I neglected him too much. His life was a permanent ordeal. I hope that he is happier now. I can\u2019t speak to you in everyday language, the death of a father profoundly changes one\u2019s thoughts and makes one believe firmly in greater happiness in another life.\u201d\n\nIt seems that this acceptance of an afterlife, however, was as much an acknowledgment of the trials of earthly existence as a renewal of faith. With their frequent allusions to numerology, good and evil spirits, and omens carried in the clouds, Ensor\u2019s letters to Mariette reveal a complex and superstitious spirituality. He placed significance on the fact that he was born on Friday the thirteenth, for example, and believed that a \u201cgood devil\u201d protected him (rather than the more typical \u201cguardian angel\u201d). More immediately, though, Ensor was haunted by memories that found form in his art. To the right of the saint, beside a scene of flaying, is a red tonsured head. A split-open skull reveals a crowd of smaller heads in folio 6D/E (fig. 3). Most prominently, to the left of the saint stands a figure in what may be a straitjacket (see fig. 4). His head bursts open in a violent explosion as his mouth utters a cry. In creating this figure Ensor could well have been mindful of his father\u2019s ordeal, but the bound madman also bears the numerals XX on his chest.\n\nIf Ensor\u2019s personal life in the 1880s had its difficulties, his complicated relationships with the other members of the Belgian avant-garde meant that his professional life offered little solace. As he began work on The Temptation in January 1887, the fourth exhibition of Les XX (Les Vingt; 1883\u201393) approached, with an opening date of February 5. This caused him considerable anxiety. Not only was Ensor determined to show his best work, but there were also tensions between Les XX\u2019s members and the organizers. Already, in 1886, Ensor had rallied successfully against James McNeill Whistler\u2019s membership in the group. Now \u00c9mile Verhaeren, impressed by the work of Georges Seurat at the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition in Paris, had persuaded the Neo-Impressionist to exhibit in Brussels. No doubt afraid of losing his hard-won status in avant-garde circles, Ensor wrote to Mariette of his worries, plagued with indecision over his choice of submission:\n\nI begin by begging you to forgive me for this letter and my handwriting. I am troubled: I have the exhibition on my mind. . . . The fear of the exhibition won\u2019t leave me. I will send the compositions. As for the paintings, I haven\u2019t a clue, probably the Christ walking on water. It\u2019s difficult!. . . . This frenzy is horrible. I think it will all fall flat. I was so clever as to have a falling out with Maus, Picard, Verhaeren. That group is not going to treat me properly. People said I was indispensable at Les XX; they want to prove that isn\u2019t so.\n\nIn another letter, seemingly from a similar moment, he wrote of how the thought of exhibiting left him cold, and complained that he would be treated \u201clike a man with no convictions, a deserter, the Iscariot impressionist\u201d (a phrase that, again, links his religious works to his own immediate experience). In light of these broad professional anxieties, it is understandable that Ensor inscribed XX on the straitjacket of the figure whose head explodes. The numerals appear often in Ensor\u2019s art to indicate pain or conflict: here and in the etching Christ\u2019s Entry into Brussels in 1889 (fig. 5 and fig. 6).\n\nEnsor did not suffer only psychologically in the years leading up to his creation of The Temptation. His physical health was also poor. From late in 1884, in his letters to Mariette the artist began to complain of serious symptoms: \u201csick in the stomach\u2014not in the chest\u2014extreme weakness, inflammation of the intestines and throat, dyspepsia. My morale: sad, tired, nasty. The blood I\u2019ve been spitting comes from my throat. I looked up dyspepsia in the Larousse dictionary. I saw: Dyspepsia: brought on by lack of exercise, solitary life, without distractions, without ambition . . . is very common among prisoners, etc., etc.\u201d\n\nIt was not until early in 1885\u2014after another episode of spitting blood\u2014that Ensor received a diagnosis. He had a tapeworm. Today, with appropriate medication, doctors can remove parasites easily; but in the nineteenth century, when treatment options were limited and imprecise, a worm meant torment for the sufferer. The artist\u2019s account of his battle to expel the creature is alarming:\n\nI\u2019m sick. A new illness: a tapeworm. . . . As of a few days ago, the stomachaches have become atrocious. I\u2019ve vomited blood and worn myself out terribly. Three days after drinking several glasses of Vichy water and eating lots of prunes, I lost thirty centimeters of the worm, I called the doctor, he made me take a very bitter liquid that made me dizzy and gave me bad diarrhea, but the tapeworm didn\u2019t budge. Today he made me drink several ounces of castor oil. Then the savage creature showed itself. I just lost two meters of it, but that isn\u2019t enough. We have to start again tomorrow. That\u2019s three days that I\u2019ve eaten nothing except for an egg and some soup this evening. . . . The thing is frighteningly large and has unprecedented stamina. How could the doctor not have guessed what was wrong with me! . . . It seems that this animal was eating a good 3/4 of my meals, that it is he who made me lose weight and took away my desire to work and paint.\n\nIn another missive, Ensor described a two-meter piece of the tapeworm left \u201cin the chamber pot, twisted like a rope, adorned with Gordian knots.\u201d Once again, in the life of the artist, torment appears as a leitmotif. Although he had moments of happiness in the years 1884\u00ad\u201394 (even in this letter he relates plans to pick mushrooms the next day), on balance, bad experiences outweighed the good.\n\nEnsor\u2019s struggle with the parasite dragged on until August 1885, when on the twenty-second of the month, he could finally report that the worm was gone. He signed the letter with a drawing of a tapeworm as his signature, in a supremely visual expression of how the creature had taken him over (see fig. 7, fig. 8, and fig. 9). Yet if the worm had left him physically, mentally it was thoroughly internalized. In his 1892 painting The Bad Doctors, a macabre physician pulls a worm from the stomach of a half-dead patient (fig. 10). Another brandishes the head of the creature on a spike. Before then, however, worms infested his drawings. In The Temptation, reinforcing the aggressive mood of the drawing, worms wriggle and squirm their way across the sheets. Sometimes they appear in segments, as on the robe of the saint (sheet 7E); sometimes they are serpents that wind around pillars, their open jaws revealing dragonlike tongues (sheet 4F). They crawl in or out of mouths, or they have mouths of their own (fig. 11). An anthropomorphic worm looms large in the foreground of the image (fig. 12). Its head resembles the scolex of a tapeworm. The amalgamation of human and parasite is disquieting, but it makes perfect sense in relation to the artist\u2019s biography.\n\nIn addition to dealing with his own health problems, Ensor also worried about the well-being of his mother, as she suffered from bile and from swelling of the stomach. Though diagnosis proved elusive, at times she was sufficiently ill for the doctor to suggest summoning a priest. Enemas seem to have offered some relief, but her problems were persistent, and on occasion similar troubles plagued his aunt and sister. Ensor mentioned these worries to Mariette and kept a record of his mother\u2019s bathroom visits, but when his strength failed (as it did in the summer of 1886 when he had dental problems) the situation became unbearable:\n\nOur house has been a place of anguish. I had the doctor come. I was forced to stop doing any work. I don\u2019t go out anymore. Horrible neuralgia tortures me. The dentist extracted one of my teeth but only got half of it out. The neuralgia continues. Mitche is paralyzed with rheumatism. My mother suffers gall bladder attacks. In our house all you hear is groaning. I wanted to end with the fine death of the king of Bavaria. Now I\u2019d rather buy a very small gun and hold it at my neck against my spine and let it go in a burst of satisfaction. I don\u2019t think it would hurt very much. Sometimes I have really desperate moments.\n\nThe swollen stomachs and defecating figures that appear so often in Ensor\u2019s work\u2014not least The Temptation\u2014surely bear some relationship to these biographical events. In his imagery, reflecting events at home, bodily functions become anything but private.\n\nDespite his troubles, Ensor did have moments of inspiration; these further illustrate the close relationship between fact and fiction in his work. In the aforementioned grief-stricken letter that saw him lament his shortcomings as a son, Ensor explained to Mariette that he had \u201cstarted a few fantastic compositions based on Edgar Poe: the Pit and the Pendulum. The blazing walls and the atrocious watch of the demons, it\u2019s going well and calms my current moods. Before the compositions I feel anxious and exalted and at this moment I can\u2019t ask for more.\u201d This adds additional support to the idea that life, art, and writing are closely connected in Ensor\u2019s work. Poe\u2019s story tells of its narrator\u2019s relentless suffering at the hands of the Inquisition. No sooner does the protagonist escape one form of torture than his situation worsens, until at last he is on the brink of death (from which, incidentally, he escapes). Perhaps Ensor would have found solace in the idea that, when all seems lost, redemption is possible, but the imagery in the story\u2014like that in Ensor\u2019s drawings of around 1887\u2014is exhausting in its multiplicity. The hallucinogenic mood that prevails in The Temptation of Saint Anthony seems to stem in part from Poe\u2019s tale. Early in \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum,\u201d the narrator faints, his head filled with unbidden memories: \u201cHe who has not swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view.\u201d Although the connection is not literal\u2014individual creativity is always at work in Ensor\u2019s production\u2014it seems as if the writings of the gothic novelist helped him to tap the creative potential of a difficult time. It is worth noting that Ensor also greatly admired Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, another author who produced works characterized by their psychological intensity, and that, during this period and beyond, Ensor reworked earlier drawn interiors to create the darkly fantastic Rousseau drawings (see fig. 13).\n\nTo return briefly to Flaubert, if Ensor found inspiration in the French author, he also had reason to empathize with him. Copying from an unidentified critique of Flaubert (or, possibly, taking notes from a seminar held at the Cercle Artistique et Lit\u00e9raire in Brussels), Ensor recorded that The Temptation of Saint Anthony had been \u201cthe greatest effort to ever tax the novelist\u2019s mind.\u201d The assessment was no doubt true, since in a state of utter despondence, Flaubert had embarked on a first version after the death of his own father. \u201cNo one has a stronger sense of life\u2019s misery than I,\u201d Flaubert wrote to the poet Louise Colet. \u201cThere is nothing in this life for me but beautiful verse, well-turned phrases, harmonious singing, beautiful sunsets, moonlight, colored paintings, ancient marbles and expressive heads. Besides that, nothing.\u201d \u201cIn Saint Anthony I myself was Saint Anthony,\u201d he wrote to Colet at a later date. \u201cHe\u2019s quite a character to play.\u201d The writer\u2019s final version of The Temptation plays out over the course of a night and, although not an adapation of the book, Ensor\u2019s drawing does possess a distinctly dreamlike atmosphere.\n\nSaint Anthony was a common theme for nineteenth-century painters and draftsmen. Many of Ensor\u2019s contemporaries, including F\u00e9licien Rops and Fernand Khnopff, had already addressed it in their art. In selecting the subject, however, Ensor was swayed by much earlier precedents. He drew specifically from works by Jacques Callot and Hieronymus Bosch, developing his knowledge of the former through a book that Mariette sent as a gift. \u201cYou are kind, a thousand times kind,\u201d he wrote in thanks, in January 1887. The monograph in question was probably a recent volume by Marius Vachon, published in 1886, which featured a double-page reproduction of Callot\u2019s famous etching (fig. 14). The print shows its protagonist, beset by demons, in a fantastic war-torn landscape. Cowered beneath elaborate architecture, Callot\u2019s Saint Anthony looks toward a broken sky, ripped open by a dragon-like creature. Ensor quoted the image more or less literally in both the painted and drawn versions of his Temptation, in areas that include the demon-like creatures in the sky in the Museum of Modern Art canvas (see fig. 15), the tapeworm\u2019s \u201cmouth,\u201d or scolex, in the foreground of the Art Institute\u2019s drawing (fig. 12), and the temple-like arches at the far right of the same composition (fig. 16).\n\nInterestingly, too, the ideas that Ensor voiced in his thank you note to Mariette echo those that Vachon expressed in his study. While Vachon wrote of how Callot had found \u201cinspiration for his devil-scenes in the grotesque and phantasmagoric reveries of Hironimus [sic] Bosch,\u201d Ensor commented on the \u201cstunning devilry!\u201d he had seen in the artist\u2019s work. \u201cCallot was influenced, it is Jerome Bosch who really made this, have you seen his painting [at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019]Art Ancien: a hermit tortured by diabolical fish, the execution here was worthless, neither tone, nor light, nor proper drawing, but a diabolic inventiveness and imagination that deeply impresses nervous people.\u201d The painting to which Ensor here refers is the Temptation of Saint Anthony triptych, which had been recently acquired by the new Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Art Ancien in Brussels.\n\nBeyond serving as a source of imagery, these precedents also indirectly prompted him to start work on a composition that would have equaled his Christ\u2019s Entry into Brussels in 1889 in size, taking the joys of paradise and the horrors of hell as its theme. More ambitious than even his Visions series, this work may have instead become The Temptation; it has the devils Dzitts and Hihahox, mentioned in his plan, as its nucleus (see fig. 17). In a prose style that borders on stream of consciousness, Ensor explained to Mariette that\n\nthe devils of Callot are coming to trouble me. Luckily my composition stopped and my devils are found. They will seem all the more awful as God and angels will occupy the entire upper part of my composition. I finished my Christ in Hell. . . . Christ[,] touched by the suffering of the unfortunates burning in Hell, descends there to deliver an armistice proposition to Satan. Satan welcomes him very warmly and sends his lieutenants Dzittssz and Hishahoxzs to escort him, led by Crazou mounted on a furious cat. They have a hard time of it and grow exhausted, having to defend Christ who is attacked fiercely by the luckless condemned whose prolonged suffering has made them violent.\n\nThe confluence of ideas in Ensor\u2019s letter might explain why the artist chose a Dantesque structure for his Temptation. Christ and the Virgin occupy a pseudoheaven, infiltrated by a hot air balloon and creatures of the zodiac; a central vertical axis, from Saint Anthony to God, meets with a short horizontal axis that depicts all kinds of torture. Effectively, Ensor placed his saint among the \u201chorrors\u201d (and below the \u201cjoys\u201d) he had envisaged in the earliest stages of the work. Under the eye of the Devil, enthroned above his head, Anthony risks the same fate as the flayed, skeleton bishop in sheet 5D. Conversely, should he resist, redemption is his. The oppositions\u2014between good and evil, Christ and the Devil, the holy Woman and the female flayers\u2014are obvious. Saint Anthony\u2019s fate is in his own hands. Ensor must have liked the result for, in 1893, he employed a comparable structure in his Icone\u2014Portrait of Eug\u00e8ne Detmolder (fig. 18).\n\nAnother letter that Ensor penned to Mariette in 1887 is frenzied in appearance. Dozens of heads obscure the words on the page; their reiterated shapes form a network of thick black lines (fig. 19). Despite challenges, Ensor explained to Mariette, he was making steady progress on The Temptation and was happy with the result: \u201cI\u2019ve added a few hundred more figures: ghastly devils, horrible animals, revolting and obscene monsters. I am very pleased.\u201d As the erratic form of the letter suggests, however, it is likely that Ensor was in a disturbed mental state.\n\nCorrespondence between the artist and Octave Maus, the secretary of Les XX, makes it clear that the artist\u2019s physical well-being had also deteriorated at this time. He was bedridden for four weeks in December 1887 and wrote anxiously, \u201cI don\u2019t know how it will end.\u201d Soon after, in another missive to Maus, he drew a self-portrait dressed in a nightshirt and in the company of Death (fig. 20). By January 14, 1888, he was so weak that, on at least one occasion, he had to dictate his orrespondence. This physical weakness may explain why Ensor did not adhere the separate sheets and folios of The Temptation onto canvas himself and instead entrusted the task to a relation. \u201cAunt Mimi is gluing the drawings beautifully,\u201d he wrote to Mariette in January 1888. \u201cMagnificent result! The Temptation will probably be carefully glued by tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAmbiguity surrounds the initial exhibition of The Temptation. Various sources indicate that Les XX at first refused Ensor\u2019s submissions, but reconsideration of a pressbook kept by Octave Maus suggests that the drawing may have first appeared in public in 1888. Evidently, the work was not on view when the show opened, as the first press reports (written in February) noted the absence of the artist\u2019s submissions. \u201cWe regret not to have seen the extraordinary Temptation of Saint Anthony by the extraordinary sketcher James Ensor,\u201d wrote Th\u00e9o Hannon in his review of the exhibition. His choice of phrase is interesting; it indicates that, for Mariette\u2019s brother, Ensor was now a croquiste, a casual draftsman, before he was a painter (Th\u00e9o could easily have chosen the word dessinateur, or \u201cdraftsman\u201d). Perhaps this interpretation was informed by seeing The Temptation, made with new and unorthodox materials, in the artist\u2019s studio. Th\u00e9o may have recognized that it challenged conventional hierarchies of media. At the very least, he would surely have heard about the work from his sister and was no doubt keen for its debut.\n\nTh\u00e9o was perhaps in luck. On February 10, 1888, La Belgique reported that the artist would send several drawings to add to the installation. \u201cThe kind artist, who is recovering from a serious illness, will send on Saturday, to Les XX, several drawings, of which these are the principal: Temptation of Saint Anthony, My Portrait, The Battle of the Pouilleux, My Dead Father, sketches, etchings and drypoints.\u201d Ensor could well have done so for, on March 4, a review makes mention of submissions, including My Dead Father. An anonymous critique, perhaps prompted by The Temptation, is negative but, like Th\u00e9o\u2019s commentary, recognizes Ensor as something more than a painter:\n\nFor most of the public, Ensor is a strange artist who often seems to want to cause upset, unnecessarily and as if out of malice, to the visitors who stop before his paintings. Hence, this year, next to drawings that show an uncommon sense of line, he exhibits sketches in charcoal or wax crayon where everything is indecision and repentance. In these latest productions, hardly tasteful but very curious, he was clearly carried by a preoccupation with color. Ensor paints with charcoal, with crayon, in prints, as he would with a paintbrush. Has he been wrong?\n\nThe critic\u2019s question may have been rhetorical but, since Ensor appears to have shown The Temptation at the salon of Les XX the following year, it is clear that the artist felt justified in his unconventional approach.\n\nReadings of The Temptation and its role in Ensor\u2019s career will evolve with continued study of the Rousseau letters, but this seems an appropriate place to pause. What has become apparent is that this drawing was his most ambitious. It marked a watershed moment when the artist extended the boundaries of his creative practice in new and exciting ways. As he built on the achievements of his Visions series, real and intellectual experiences became something more than the sum of their parts in the visual storytelling process, sometimes even months or years after the event. And as Ensor committed these occurrences to paper\u2014in letters or drawings\u2014he became something greater than a correspondent, a painter, or even a \u201csketcher\u201d: a cartographer of new territories.\n\nIn 1925, recalling his teenage working method, Ensor described a figure that closely resembles the artist of The Temptation: \u201cTerrorized, I overworked, I painted in the morning, I composed in the afternoon. I drew in the evening and at night I mapped out my dreams: stiff blue or ivory towers, strange towns, fat ironic and zany women, singular masks, mocking birds from sardonic countries with a sardonic eye and azure beak.\u201d It was surely from the mid-1880s\u2014and particularly from his creation of the Art Institute\u2019s monumental drawing\u2014that Ensor\u2019s art and life became as symbiotic as his written and drawn lines on paper.\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">The Ensor-Rousseau letters, which total around 350, consist of the correspondence between Ensor and Mariette Rousseau, her husband Ernest Rousseau senior, and their son Ernest Rousseau junior. They were brought to the attention of Patrick Florizoone in 2014 and will be the subject of a forthcoming book. The authors would like to caution that the exact chronology of the letters is unclear, so the letter numbering used here may be revised. Unless otherwise noted, all translations in these notes are by the authors and Roger Hutchin, who have made minor corrections to Ensor\u2019s spelling, grammar, and orthography.\n\nAs Tricot has argued in his volume collecting later Ensor letters, writing was essential to the artist, and his correspondence reveals much about his personality. Tricot, introduction, in James Ensor, Lettres, ed. Xavier Tricot (Labor, 1999), p. 9.\n\nFor further discussion of Ensor\u2019s connection to the Rousseau family, see \u201cRevelation, Resistance, and Resilience,\u201d para. 18.\n\nTheir purchases included The Bourgeois Salon (1881; Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp).\n\nFor over two decades, starting in 1849, Flaubert worked on the theme of Saint Anthony, finally publishing a book on it in 1874. In letter 157 (undated, possibly c. 1884) Ensor mentions Mariette\u2019s praise of a book by Flaubert. He doesn\u2019t specify the title, but it appears to be a volume of correspondence, as the quotes he uses in the letter match up with lines from Flaubert\u2019s letters. Ensor\u2019s interest in Flaubert\u2014as Susan M. Canning suggests\u2014may also have stemmed from Th\u00e9o Hannon\u2019s friendship with Huysmans. See \u201cRevelation, Resistance, and Resilience,\u201d para. 6.\n\nEnsor, carnet with notes from Flaubert, collection of Patrick Florizoone. Some of the other Ensor carnets in the collection contain notes from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\n\n\u201cMaintenant j\u2019\u00e9cris beaucoup. Je voudrais acqu\u00e9rir ce qu\u2019on appelle style. Je copie des lettres de Flaubert \u00e0 Georges Sand. Je trouve son style bien bref, il ne veut presque jamais de virgule. Malgr\u00e9 \u00e7a il est tr\u00e8s profond et se fait bien comprendre (pour moi). Quand j\u2019\u00e9crirai convenablement vous verrez souvent de mes \u00e9critures. Je n\u2019aurai plus inqui\u00e9tude de voir Madame Rousseau d\u00e9couvrir quelque \u00e9norme faute (accent circonflexe manquant, i sans point). Je dormirai tranquille.\u201d Letter 37, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, Mar. 31, 1884.\n\n\u201cOh comme on se sent pr\u00e8s de la folie quelquefois moi surtout.

The full original text comes from a December 27, 1852, letter from Flaubert to Louise Colet that also contains the lines: \u201cTu sais mon influence sur les fous et comme ils m\u2019aiment ! Je t\u2019assure que j\u2019ai peur maintenant. Pourtant, en me mettant \u00e0 ma table pour t\u2019\u00e9crire, la vue du papier blanc m\u2019a calm\u00e9.\u201d See Flaubert, Correspondance, vol. 2, Juillet 1851 \u00e0 d\u00e9cembre 1858, ed. Jean Bruneau (Gallimard, 1980), p. 219. Coincidentally, in the letter Ensor selected, Flaubert finds himself deeply disturbed by Balzac\u2019s 1832 novel Louis Lambert, but the artist professed admiration for Balzac in his missive to Mariette. It seems likely that he would have identified with some of the unfortunate young men the novelist created in his Com\u00e9die humaine (Human Comedy).\n\nLetter 37, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, Mar. 31, 1884. Ensor asks his friend if the catalogue is progressing; he also describes an unfamiliar type of mushroom he has found.\n\nGoethe in conversation with Eckermann, April 18, 1827, published in Conversations of Goethe with Johann Eckermann, ed. J. K. Moorhead, trans. John Oxenford (Da Capo, 1998), p. 196.\n\nWriting and drawing seem to have been analogous for Ensor in the 1880s. Interestingly, the artist increasingly alluded to audio sensation in his visual production. For a technical discussion of how Ensor used the patch in his etching Extraordinary Musicians, see \u201cTranscending Tradition,\u201d para. 23 The artist\u2019s letters reveal an interest in nature conservancy and animal welfare and a pronounced opposition to vivisection.  \n\nAt a date that is hard to pinpoint, it seems that the Ensor family may have taken on a second pug, called Bella. See letter 169, Ensor to Mariette and Ernest Rousseau senior, undated, probably 1891 or 1892.\n\n\u201cMitche poss\u00e8de maintenant un carlin minuscule qui remplit la maison le soir de son important personne.

Mais soyons prudent et ne parlons inutilement de cette gente redoutable et crochue et ac\u00e9r\u00e9e.

But let\u2019s be careful and not speak needlessly of this formidable and hooked and sharp race. Let\u2019s not summon their strange attention because to me their intentions seem infinitely complicated.)\n\nIt is possible more generally that imagery of falling blood in the work, such as that to the right of the saint in sheet 7F, bears some relation to this episode. Restraining garments were often made of patterned cloth in the nineteenth century, as such material proved stronger.

Rouam, 1886). It is likely that this book also informed Ensor\u2019s etching The Pisser (1887; D12, Cr12, T12, E12, Tr10a), since Callot\u2019s version was reproduced on page 29. Susan M. Canning suggests an alternative source for Ensor\u2019s print in her article \u201cThe Ordure of Anarchy: Scatalogical Signs of Self and Society in the Art of James Ensor,\u201d in \u201cScatalogical Art,\u201d special issue, Art Journal 52, 3 (Fall 1993), pp. 47\u201353. This is Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Lynen\u2019s cover for Th\u00e9o Hannon\u2019s Au pays de Manneken-Pis (Henry Kistemaeckers, 1883), reproduced in Les XX and the Belgian Avant Garde: Prints, Drawings, and Books ca. 1890, ed. Stephen H. Goddard (Spencer Museum of Art, 1992), p. 194.\n\nThe print had also proved a source of inspiration for Flaubert, who wrote, \u201cI unrolled my Temptation of Saint Anthony and hung it on the wall; that\u2019s all. I like this work greatly. I\u2019d wanted it for a long time. For me the sad grotesque holds an incomparable charm; it speaks to the intimate needs of my stupidly bitter nature. It doesn\u2019t make me laugh, but dream at length. I sense it everywhere it lies, as it rests in me, as it does in everyone.\u201d Published in Flaubert, Extraits de la correspondance; ou, Pr\u00e9face \u00e0 la vie d\u2019\u00e9crivain, ed. Genevi\u00e8ve Boll\u00e8me (Seuil, 1963), pp. 39\u201340.\n\n\u201cQuelles diableries \u00e9tourdissantes! Callot a \u00e9t\u00e9 influenc\u00e9, c\u2019est J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bosch qui a fait cela, avez-vous [vu] \u00e0 l\u2019art ancien son tableau: un ermite tourment\u00e9 par des poissons diaboliques, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution ici [\u00e9tait] nulle, ni ton, ni lumi\u0117re, ni dessin correct, mais une invention et imagination diabolique impressionnant vivement les gens nerveux.\u201d Letter 407, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, Jan. 1887.\n\nThe demons and fishes in the Tribulations of Saint Anthony (fig. 1 on p. 42) are also reminiscent of those in the triptych The Temptation of Saint Anthony by the studio of Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1520\u201330; Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels).\n\n\u201cles diables de Callot viennent me troubler. Heureusement que ma composition est arr\u00eat\u00e9e et mes diables trouv\u00e9s. Ils para\u00eetront d\u2019autant plus horribles que tout le dessus de ma composition sera occup\u00e9 par Dieu et les anges. J\u2019ai termin\u00e9 mon Christ aux Enfers. . . . Le Christ touch\u00e9 par des souffrances des malheureux rissol\u00e9s dans l\u2019Enfer, y est descendu pour porter \u00e0 Satan une proposition d\u2019armistice. Satan lui accueillait fort bien et envoya pour escorter ses lieutenants Dzittssz et Hishahoxzs command\u00e9s par Crazou mont\u00e9 surun chat furieux. Ils eurent de la peine et se fatigu\u00e8rent beaucoup devant d\u00e9fendre le Christ vivement attaqu\u00e9 par les malheureux damn\u00e9s que les longues souffrances avaient rendu furieux.\u201d Letter 407, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, Jan. 1887. It is also possible that this description is a reference to Ensor\u2019s unlocated drawing L\u2019enfer et le paradis, reproduced in Gregoire Le Roy, James Ensor (Van Oest, 1922), p. 22. The drawing was listed in Ensor\u2019s 1929 retrospective (cat. 116) as a \u201cdessin rehauss\u00e9\u201d dated 1886; it was far smaller (19.5 \u00d7 22.5 cm) than the work Ensor indicates in his letter, but could have been a preparatory sketch for a more ambitious composition. This work differs stylistically from The Temptation, but it does include Christ and Mary in a hierarchical structure above a devil. The authors are grateful to Susan M. Canning for this observation.\n\nIn this composition, Ensor's friend the art critic Eug\u00e8ne Demolder appears as a holy man who must first experience the \u201cpassion of Christ\u201d before finding his place beside the Mother of God in Paradise. For a complete reading of the work, see Patrick Florizoone, \u201cEug\u00e8ne Demolder en James Ensor, een wederzijdse heiligverklaring,\u201d in Philip Van den Bossche, Xavier Tricot, Patrick Florizoone, and Norbert Hostyn, Bij Ensor op bezoek (Pandora, 2010), pp. 57\u201376, fig. 5. For more on Ensor\u2019s composition schemes, see Patrick Florizoone, Les bains \u00e0 Ostend (Pandora, 1996), pp. 84\u201386.\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai ajout\u00e9 encore quelques centaines de figures: Diables atroces, animaux horribles, monstres infects et ind\u00e9cents. Je suis tr\u00e8s satisfait.\u201d Letter 417B, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, [1887].\n\n\u201cGravement malade et je ne sais comment cela finira.\u201d Ensor to Octave Maus, Dec. 1887, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, inv. 5041. Ensor to Octave Maus, Jan. 14, 1888, Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, inv. 5040, cited in Heymans, Ensor et les medicins: Un diagnostic (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, 1997), pp. 17\u201320.\n\n\u201cLa tante Mimi colle parfaitement les dessins. R\u00e9sultat magnifique! La Tentation sera probablement consciemment coll\u00e9 pour demain.\u201d Letter 96, Ensor to Mariette Rousseau, Jan. 1888.\n\nThe authors are grateful for the assistance of Sabine Taevernier and Susan M. Canning, who alerted them to the existence of the pressbook and advised in the analysis. Susan M. Canning and Jane Block both offer interpretations of the various reviews, concluding that the work was not shown.

Ainsi, cette ann\u00e9e, il \u00e9xpose \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de dessins qui d\u00e9notent un sentiment des lignes peu commun, des croquis au charbon ou crayon gras ou tout est ind\u00e9cision et repentir.
