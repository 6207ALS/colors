    "description": "<p>Mikki Ferrill began her career as a photojournalist after studying graphic design and illustration at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and photographed for <em>Ebony</em> magazine throughout the 1970s. Her work was also included in the first volume of the <em>Black Photographers Annual</em> (1973), a seminal publication created by members of the Kamoinge Workshop to showcase a range of black photographic practices; over the course of its four-issue run, the publication would feature James Van Der Zee, Roy DeCarava, and Dawoud Bey, in addition to many lesser-known photographers. In her photographs of dancers in 1970s Chicago, Ferrill suggests her relaxed relationship to her subjects, candidly capturing their easy rapport with the photographer and one another.</p>\n",
