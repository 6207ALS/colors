    "description": "<p>Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez led and co-founded Mexico\u2019s most famous printmaking collective, the <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artists/72887/taller-de-grafica-popular-mexico-city-mexico\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular (TGP)</a> (the Popular Graphic Arts Workshop). A virtuosic printmaker himself, M\u00e9ndez used his artwork to further the causes of agrarian reforms, Indigenous rights, and anti-fascism. He and the other members of the TGP initiated a tradition of activist printmaking that continues in Mexico to this day.</p><p>M\u00e9ndez was born and studied art in Mexico City. In 1933, he joined the Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios (the League of Revolutionary Writers and Artists), with whom he developed a philosophy of art as a means of activism and liberation for the people of Mexico. Soon after, in 1937, M\u00e9ndez founded the Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular, a collective of artists who made everything from ephemeral prints to high-quality illustrated books in service of leftist political reform. M\u00e9ndez remained with the TGP until 1961, after which he devoted himself to publishing books on Mexican printmaking and folk art, as well as supporting leftist movements around the world, until his death in 1969.</p><p>The Art Institute of Chicago houses one of the largest North American collections of M\u00e9ndez\u2019s work and hosted a 1945 exhibition, <em>Prints and Drawings by Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez</em>, of works acquired from the artist. M\u00e9ndez created <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/54598/what-may-come-mexico-1945\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>What May Com</em>e</a>, a woodblock print commenting on the future of Mexico and the brewing World War II, specifically for that exhibition.</p><p>For further reading:</p><p>Avila, Teresa. 2014. \u201cEl Taller de Gr\u00e1fica Popular and the Chronicles of Mexican History and Nationalism.\u201d <em>Third Text </em>28 (3): 311\u2013321. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2014.930578\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09528822.2014.930578</a>.</p><p>Caplow, Deborah. 1999. \"Leopoldo Mendez, Revolutionary Art, and the Mexican Print: In Service of the People.\" Order No. 9954820, University of Washington. <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/leopoldo-mendez-revolutionary-art-mexican-print/docview/304533576/se-2?accountid=15021\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/leopoldo-mendez-revolutionary-art-mexican-print/docview/304533576/se-2?accountid=15021</a>.</p><p>Matusoff Merfish, Beth. \u201cCurating Context: The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s 1945 Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez Exhibition.\u201d <em>Journal of Curatorial Studies </em>7 (1). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1386/jcs.7.1.58_1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.1386/jcs.7.1.58_1</a>.</p><p>Torres Arroyo, Ana Mar\u00eda. 2013. \u201cEl gesto expresivo en la gr\u00e1fica de Leopoldo M\u00e9ndez.\u201d <em>Amerika </em>8. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4000/amerika.4060\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://doi.org/10.4000/amerika.4060</a>.</p>",
