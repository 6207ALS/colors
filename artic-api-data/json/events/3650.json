    "description": "<p><strong>The topic for this month's Intersections is Voice.</strong></p><p>Public figures and politicians have recently been scrutinized not only for the content of their spoken statements, but also for their volume, expression, and tone of voice. How does the way words are expressed communicate meaning of its own? Join museum educators Paulina Lopez and Nenette Luarca-Shoaf for a conversation examining voice and the experiences of hearing, being heard, and being silenced.&nbsp;</p><p>In this interactive series, the Art Institute\u2019s encyclopedic collection serves as a catalyst for conversations about urgent social questions and current events. Come ready to participate and create community through dialogue about art. Facilitators select featured artworks and post them here in advance of each discussion in order to be responsive to an ever-changing world.    </p><p>Visit the <a href=\"/events?program=10\" target=\"_blank\">calendar</a> to view upcoming Intersections programs on the second Friday of each month.</p><p>To request an accessibility accommodation for an Art Institute program, please call (312) 443-3680 or send an email to <a href=\"mailto:access@artic.edu\">access@artic.edu</a> as far in advance as possible.</p><p>Please see the museum\u2019s <a href=\"/visit/accessibility\" target=\"_blank\">Accessibility page</a> for more information.</p>",
