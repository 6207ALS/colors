Emanuel de Witte was one of a small group of painters who specialized in explorations of the light, shade, and volume particular to church interiors. In this painting, executed late in the artist\u2019s career, the organ and genealogical panels honoring the dead (suspended from the ceiling and affixed to the columns) are the only decoration.</p>\n",
