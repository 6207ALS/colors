Her niece, Julia Mamaea, invited Origen to Antioch to discuss Christianity, reflecting the wide interest in religion that the whole Severan dynasty evidenced. Julia\u2019s official portrait, disseminated from Rome, emphasizes an idealized dignity, but her almond-shaped eyes and distinctive hairstyle personalize the image. The inscription PIETAS on the reverse does not refer only to religious piety, but rather to duty or devotion in a broader sense. The inscription is remarkable in that it does not merely refer to Julia\u2019s devotion to her family: the plural ending (AVGG) indicates that the Augusta is being formally associated with her husband in the evocation of devotion to the gods, to the ancestors, and to the state, which is the most important virtue of a ruler.  \nTheresa Gross-Diaz\n\n</section><section epub:type=\"footnotes\" id=\"footnotes\">Levick, Julia Domna, Syrian Empress, pp. 116\u201318.\n\nHiesinger, \u201cJulia Domna,\u201d pp. 42\u201343.
