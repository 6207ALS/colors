    "description": "<p>In the foreground of this tapestry based on the biblical story of Jacob and Esau, Rebecca advises her favorite son Jacob, clad in a star-adorned cloak, how to steal the birthright that belongs to his twin brother, Esau. The two young goats standing in the foreground were requested by Rebecca so she might cook a meal for Jacob to offer Isaac in exchange for the birthright. The scene in the right background shows the blind Isaac lying in bed and blessing the kneeling Jacob, having mistaken him for Esau. Rebecca stands nearby, holding a platter of goat meat. In the left background, Esau hunts with his dogs, unaware of the plot against him. All episodes shown are based on Genesis 27:2\u201329. The story of Jacob was a common subject for tapestry series; various <em>Jacob</em> suites were woven by Brussels and Flemish weavers in the 16th century.</p>\n",
