    "description": "<p>At the start of the Civil War, Alexander Gardner was granted unlimited access to photograph the Union troops. The images Gardner produced over the next four years\u2014documenting the aftermath of battles and the life of soldiers in camp\u2014were seen primarily in exhibitions and circulated in smaller form as cartes de visite. He published <em>Gardner\u2019s Photographic Sketch Book of the War</em> in 1865, at the war\u2019s end. With two volumes of 50 albumen prints each, the album retailed for $150\u2014the equivalent of several months of an average worker\u2019s wages\u2014making it a luxury item. According to the photographer, \u201cWhat do I want, John Henry?\u201d was a question this Union captain frequently asked his servant (ex-slaves most often served the Northern army as cooks and laborers). On the page accompanying this photograph, Gardner patronizingly described John Henry as an \u201caffectionate creature\u201d of \u201cuntutored nature,\u201d who was grateful for his newfound freedom at the war\u2019s end.</p>\n",
