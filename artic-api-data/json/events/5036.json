    "description": "<p>The Art Institute is pleased to partner with Well Connected's \"Museums at Home\" series to provide virtual slideshows and telephone-based presentations and conversations to older members of the community. To participate in this program, you will need a telephone or a computer with internet access.</p><p>In this virtual presentation, Art Institute volunteer lecturer Anne Gorham will discuss notable works from the museum\u2019s extensive American Impressionism collection. In the late nineteenth century, dozens of American artists traveled to Europe to study a new form of art called Impressionism. When they returned home, they transformed the French ideas of Impressionism into a distinctly American artistic experience. American Impressionism began in the 1880s and lasted well into the 1920s, and some of the movement's notable figures included William Merritt Chase, George Inness, Mary Cassatt, and Winslow Homer. Impressionism was popular in Chicago and was shown regularly at annual exhibitions such as the Interstate Industrial Exposition during the 1880s and at the 1893 World\u2019s Columbian Exposition.</p><p><a href=\"https://aic-web-cms-uploads.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nullbd86b565-3b2e-4ee0-902e-668f4ecd2f08/ImpressionismAnAmericanExperience2020-5-13WellConnected.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Please refer to this handout for the presentation.</strong></a></p><p>This presentation is offered as part of the Art Institute's <a href=\"/lifelonglearning\">Arts Insights</a> program.
