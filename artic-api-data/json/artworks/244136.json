    "description": "<p>This poster publicized multiple performances at local venues; the other two were reproduced with blanks that could be inscribed with details for impromptu gigs anywhere. All three were designed to promote performances by renowned jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela and the band Kalahari. Kalahari took its name from southern Africa\u2019s vast desert, which covers much of Botswana.</p>\n<p>The band consisted largely of Botswanan musicians, including the famed guitarist John Selolwane and the equally lauded bassist Aubrey Oaki. Masekela and Kalahari began collaborating shortly after the trumpeter arrived in Gaborone from touring in the United States, and they continued to work together throughout the 1980s.</p>\n",
