    "description": "<p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Print developed from Paul Cezanne\u2019s&nbsp;<em data-mce-fragment=\"1\">The Bathers</em>, 1899-1904, from The Art Institute of Chicago\u2019s collection.</p><p data-mce-fragment=\"1\">Through his studies of groups of bathers outdoors, Paul C\u00e9zanne reconceived a classical subject in a modern, pictorial idiom. It is an independent, exploratory work painted with a more spritely touch. For all its compositional complexity, it retains the lightness of a watercolor, with thin parallel strokes and dashes and areas of white-primed canvas showing through the paint.</p><ul><li><strong>Print Reproduction</strong></li><li><strong>Image size:</strong>&nbsp; 13.375 x 11 in.</li><li><strong>Full poster size:</strong>&nbsp;16 x 12 in.</li><li><strong>Material:</strong>&nbsp;Premium Cardstock</li></ul>",
